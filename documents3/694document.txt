Full list of author information of 5-cytosine-methylation in these biological functions. In recent years, computational
is available at the end of the methods of predicting m5C sites have attracted lots of interests because of its eff-
article ciency and low-cost. However, both the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are

not satisfactory yet and need further improvement.

Results: In this work, we have developed a new computational method, m5CPred-
SVM, to identify m5C sites in three species, H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana.

To build this model, we first collected benchmark datasets following three recently
published methods. Then, six types of sequence-based features were generated based
on RNA segments and the sequential forward feature selection strategy was used to
obtain the optimal feature subset. After that, the performance of models based on dif-
ferent learning algorithms were compared, and the model based on the support vec-
tor machine provided the highest prediction accuracy. Finally, our proposed method,
m5CPred-SVM was compared with several existing methods, and the result showed
that m5CPred-SVM offered substantially higher prediction accuracy than previously
published methods. It is expected that our method, m5CPred-SVM, can become a use-
ful tool for accurate identification of m5C sites.

Conclusion: In this study, by introducing position-specific propensity related features,
we built a new model, m5CPred-SVM, to predict RNA m5C sites of three different spe-
cies. The result shows that our model outperformed the existing state-of-art models.
Our model is available for users through a web server at https://zhulab.ahu.edu.cn/

Background
Over 170 chemical modifications have been discovered in both coding and non-cod-
ing RNAs to date [1-3]. 5-cytosine-methylation is one of the most common post-

transcriptional modifications (PTCM) and has been found in almost all types of RNA

[4, 5]. This modification can regulate nuclear mRNA output and RNA variable splic-
ing, increase RNA stability, regulate protein translation and RNA-—protein interac-
tion, and maintain the normal structure of RNA [6-14]. Under the catalysis of RNA
methyltransferase, methylation occurs on the carbon atom in the fifth position of a
cytosine to generate 5-methylcytosine (m5C). Therefore, accurate identification of
m5C sites in RNA is of great importance for understanding the mechanism and func-
tion of this modification.

Both experimental and computational methods have been developed to determine
and predict m5C sites in RNA. Experimental methods such as bisulfite sequencing [5,
12], m5C-RIP [15], Aza-IP [16], mi-CLIP [17] and RBS-segq [18] have been somewhat
successful in identification of m5C sites in RNAs of different species. However, these
experimental methods are time-consuming and expensive, and they are not able to keep
pace with the explosive increase of RNA sequences revealed by the rapid development of
sequencing technology. Instead, computational methods can be able to provide a faster
and more cost-effective way for m5C site identification.

So far, eight computational methods for predicting m5C site have been reported,
which were summarized in Table 1 according to the datasets, algorithms, webservers,
evaluation strategies and features employed. Feng et al. [19] built their model using a
support vector machine based on PseKNC features extracted from RNA segments, and
a balanced dataset with 120 m5C sites and 120 non-m5C sites was used to build this
model. In addition, nine other datasets with 120 non-m5C sites were randomly selected
to demonstrate their model is not sensitive to the selection of non-m5C sites. Later, Qiu
et al. [20] have developed a model called iRNAm5C-PseDNC to predict m5C sites by
using random forests. Differently, this model was built on an imbalanced and redundant
dataset with 475 m5C sites and 1425 non-m5C sites. Then, by using ensemble learning
methods, Zhang et al. [21] have developed a model called m5C-HPCR. A new heuristic
algorithm was introduced to reduce the number of physical and chemical properties of
nucleotides. The m5C-HPCR was benchmarked on both Feng et al’s dataset and Qiu
et al’s dataset. Sabooh et al. [22] have developed a model by fusing composite encod-
ing features including Di-Nucleotide Composition (DNC), Tri-Nucleotide Composi-
tion (TNC) and Tetra- Nucleotide Composition (TetraNC). The same dataset as that of
Feng et al. [19] and Zhang et al. [21] was again used to build this model by using SVM.
Recently, Fang et al. [23] compared the balanced dataset used in Feng et al’s work and
the imbalanced dataset used in Qiu et al’s work, and developed a model named RNAm-
5CPred to predict m5C sites of H. sapiens. The model was built by SVM and an inde-
pendent test set was used to evaluate different methods. A new predictor (PEA-m5C)
developed by Song et al. [24] mainly focused on predicting m5C sites in A. thaliana. The
model was built by using random forests on an imbalanced dataset but was tested on
three balanced independent datasets. Li et al. [25] had collected data from GEO data-
base and developed a web server RNAm5Cfinder based on random forest algorithm,
which can be used to predict m5C sites in eight kinds of cells or tissues of mouse and
human. All the m5C sites recorded in three GEO records and all other non-m5C sites in
the genomes were collected to train their models, however, the redundancy of the data-
sets was not well dealt with. More recently, Lv et al. [26] developed a server called iRNA-
m5C to predict m5C sites of four types of species. Their models are built with random

* The numbers in the parentheses are the ratios between m5C and non-m5C sites of that dataset

b Although the ratio between m5C and non-m5C sites is 120:1320, but the final model is based on a balanced dataset with
120 m5C and 120 non-m5C sites

forests with features of PseKNC, MNBE (mono-nucleotide binary encoding), KNFC(K-
tuple nucleotide frequency component) and NV (natural vector).

Although these reported methods performed well in the recognition of m5C sites in
animal and plant RNA sequences, it is possible that the performance can be improved
by introducing position specific related features such as position specific nucleotide pro-
pensity (PSNP), position specific dinucleotide propensity (PSDP). The effectiveness of
these features has been proved in previous works [27, 28] for predicting m6A of RNA,
however, the use of these features to predict m5C sites has not been explored in these
methods mentioned above. It is expected that the performance of computational meth-
ods can be further improved by mining position specific related features and composi-
tion related features.

In this study, we have developed a new method, m5CPred-SVM, to predict m5C sites
in RNA sequences of three different species, H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana.

First, we generated six kinds of features based on RNA sequences, namely k-nucleotide

frequency (KNF), pseudo dinucleotide composition (pseDNC), K-spaced nucleotide pair
frequency (KSNPF), position-specific nucleotide propensity (PSNP), K-spaced position-
specific dinucleotide propensity (KSPSDP) and Chemical Property with Density (CPD).
Then, the sequential forward feature selection strategy was used to select a compact fea-
ture subset from these six kinds of features. Based on this selected feature subset, our
method was built using a support vector machine (SVM). At last, the performance of
our method was compared with several existing methods. The results showed that our
method can offer substantially better performance than these existing methods on the

independent test sets.

Results

Performance of each type of feature

By using SVM over the ten folds cross-validation, we have evaluated the performances of
the six types of extracted features for the three species, namely H. sapiens, M. musculus
and A. thaliana. As shown in Table 2, PSNP, KSPSDP, CPD are the three features show-
ing the best performances among the six types of features for H. sapiens. The cross-vali-
dation AUROCs for these three features are 0.879, 0.862 and 0.850, respectively. Table 3
shows that CPD, KSPSDP and PSNP are the three features providing the best perfor-
mances for M. musculus. The cross-validation AUROCs are 0.812, 0.803 and 0.794 for
these three features, respectively. As for A. thaliana, Table 4 shows that the top three
models with the best performances were based on PseDNC, 4NF and CPD, and the

corresponding cross-validation AUROCs are 0.760, 0.759 and 0.753. The ROC curves of

the six types of features for H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana are shown in Fig. 1.

Feature subsets selected by SFS

Considering the fact that different features may be complementary, combination of the
six generated features may improve the predictive performance. However, there are also
redundancy between these features, and a high dimensional input feature can make the
model training very time-consuming and easily over-fitting. In order to solve the prob-
lem, we have used the sequential forward feature selection (SFS) strategy to select a
compact feature subset from these features to build our final models.

As shown in Table 2, the cross validation accuracy was convergent at the fourth round
in the SFS process for training the model of H. sapiens. The highest AUROC is 0.899,
and the corresponding feature subset includes PSNP, 4NF, 5SNPF and PseDNC.

For M. musculus, the cross validation accuracy was convergent at the third round in
the SFS process (Table 3). The highest AUROC is 0.822 and the corresponding feature
subset includes CPD, 4NF and 1SPSDP.

As for A. thaliana, Table 4 shows that the cross validation accuracy is convergent at
the fifth round in the SFS process. The highest AUROC is 0.782 and the corresponding
feature subset includes PseDNC, 3SPSDP, 4NF, 1SNPF and PSNP.

Model sensitivity to the selection of negative samples

To evaluate if the selection of the negative samples affects the predictive performances
of the models, we built other nine models based on positive samples and other nine
negative subsets for both H. sapiens and M. musculus with the optimal feature subsets.
Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2 show cross-validation performances of the 10 models
built on the positive samples and the 10 negative subsets for H. sapiens and M. musculus,
respectively. The means and the standard errors of the ROC AUCs of the ten models
are 0.843 and 0.029, and 0.822 and 0.003, for H. sapiens and M. musculus, respectively.
Additional file 1: Tables S3 and $4 show the performances of the ten models on the inde-
pendent test sets of H. sapiens and M. musculus, respectively. The means and the stand-
ard errors of the ROC AUCs of the ten models are 0.834 and 0.024, and 0.776 and 0.007,
for H. sapiens and M. musculus, respectively. The results indicate the performance of the

models is affected a little for H. sapiens by the selection of negative samples, however,
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 7 of 21

the performance is barely affected for M. musculus by the selection of negative samples.
The main possible reason is that the dataset for H. sapiens is smaller compared with that
of M. musculus. The distribution is easily fluctuated for small samples.

Comparison with other classifiers

Studies above has showed that support vector machine performed well in predicting
m5C sites for different species. In order to further investigate and compare the perfor-
mance of other classifiers, we used other five classifiers, namely KNN [29], Adaboost
[30], random forests [31], decision tree [32], logistic regression [33] and XGBoost [34
to build models based on the selected feature subsets for all the three species. The hyper
parameters for KNN, Adaboost, random forests and XGboost were also optimized with
grid search. The k of KNN is set from 1 to 10 with a step 1. The ntree of 10 to 1000 with
a step 20 is set for both Adaboost and random forests. The learning rate, max depth
and nrounds of XGboost are set between 2~* and 27', 2 and 10, and 2? and 2”°, respec-
tively. Table 5 shows the cross validation results of the six classifiers. For H. sapiens, the
AUCROC value of SVM is 0.899, which is higher than those of XGBoost, RF, KNN, Ada-
Boost, decision tree and LR at 0.020, 0.050, 0.049, 0.039, 0.221 and 0.282, respectively.
Moreover, the SVM model achieved the highest values in all other metrics. For M. mus-
culus, the AUCROC value of SVM is 0.822, which is again higher than those of RF, KNN,
AdaBoost, decision tree and LR at 0.008, 0.093, 0.010, 0.207 and 0.011, respectively, but
a little bit less than XGBoost (0.823). For A. thaliana, SVM again gave the highest AUC

value at 0.782, which is higher than those of XGBoost, RF, KNN, AdaBoost, decision tree
and LR for 0.012, 0.004, 0.048, 0.026, 0.195 and 0.052, respectively. For other metrics,
KNN has the highest Sp value and RF has the highest Pre value, while the Sn, Acc, MCC
and F1 score value of SVM offered the highest values for all the remaining 4 metrics. The
fact that SVM has outperformed all other six classifiers for both H. sapiens and A. thali-
ana and is comparable to XGBoost for M. musculus further confirms that SVM is a sta-
ble and robust classifier. As a result, SVM was selected as the final classifier in this study.

Comparison with other existing methods

In this study, we have also compared our methods with some other existing m5C site
prediction methods [19-26]. Because different benchmark datasets have been used for
building different methods, independent test sets were used to ensure the objectiveness
of the comparison. These independent test sets were only used for comparison and not
for building our models. At present, four methods are available to identify m5C sites of
H. sapiens, namely RNAm5Cfinder [25], iRNA-m5C [26], iRNAm5C-PseDNC [20] and
RNAm5CPred [23]. Two methods are available for predicting m5C sites of M. musculus,
namely RNAm5Cfinder [25] and iRNA-m5C [26]. Two methods are available for detect-
ing m5C sites of A. thaliana, namely PEA-m5C [24] and iRNA-m5C. Table 6 shows the
predictive results of these methods on the independent test sets for the three species,
and Fig. 2 shows the relevant ROC curves and PRC curves. For H. sapiens, iRNAm5C-
PseDNC has the highest Sp value (0.971), while our method gives significantly higher
values for Sn, Pre, Acc, MCC, F1 score and AUROC when compared with other meth-
ods. For M. musculus, other than Sp and Pre, again our method has the highest values for
all the remaining metrics (Sn, Pre, Acc, MCC, F1 score and AUROC). For A. thaliana,
our method gives the highest value for all the metrics. All these results have indicated
that our methods performed better than other existing methods in predicting m5C sites.

Cross-species verification

In this study, models were built for H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana individu-
ally. It will be of great interest to evaluate the species-specificity and transferability of
these models using the cross-species verification. To achieve that, the three models built

on the three species-specific m5C training data sets were further tested on the three

independent test datasets. Figure 3 shows the test results. Firstly, all the three models
performed well on its own independent test sets (see the diagonal of Fig. 3). Secondly, the
models of H. sapiens and M. musculus both performed poorly on the independent test
set of A. thaliana, and vice versa. One possible reason to explain this result is because
H. sapiens and M. musculus are both mammals while A. thaliana is plant. This reason is
supported by Fig. 4, which shows that the nucleotide distribution in the sequence of A.
thaliana is different from that of H. sapiens and M. musculus. Thirdly, the M. musculus-
specific model performed well on the H. sapiens-specific independent test set, however,
the H. sapiens-specific model performed poorly on the M. musculus-specific independ-
ent test set. It might be because the H. sapiens-specific datasets have smaller sizes than
the M. musculus-specific datasets, and the smaller datasets sizes limit the variety of
sequences which confines the transferability of the H. sapiens-specific model.

Web implementation

For the convenience of researchers, a user-friendly and publicly accessible web server
was built to implement our method, which is available at https://zhulab.ahu.edu.cn/
m5CPred-SVM. Users can predict the m5C sites on this server without complicated cal-

culation. The detailed procedure to use the web server is as below:
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 11 of 21

To start with, users need to choose one from the three species, H. sapiens, M. muscu-
lus and A. thaliana. After that, users can type the query RNA sequences into the input
box or upload a FASTA format file (Note that the input sequence should be in FASTA
format and the length of each query sequence should be longer than 41 bp). Then, by
clicking the ’submit’ button, the system will do the calculation and give the final result.
In the backend, the server would find the cytosine in the query sequence. All cytosine-
centric RNA fragment would be extracted with flank size equals to 20 and the missing
nucleotides would be filled by ‘N’ There might be lots of cytosines in a sequence, and our
predictive model will reconstruct the sequence separately for each of them. The server
home page also contains our contact information for users to contact us in case they

have problems with the server or have suggestions.

Discussion

Our study shows that the position specific related features can be effective features for
discriminating m5C sites from non-m5C sites. Theoretically speaking, the difference of
nucleotide distribution between RNA sequences containing m5C sites and those without
m5C sites determines how well we can discriminate them. In other words, the nucleo-
tide distribution around the m5C site may have a certain preference. In order to investi-
gate the nucleotide distribution preference for each sequence position, we adopted Two
Sample Logo tool [35] to conduct visualization of the nucleotide site preference around
m5C and non-m5C sites in the three species. Figure 4 clearly shows that significant dif-
ference does exist in nucleotide distribution around the m5C sites and the non-m5C
sites for these three species, and the difference was found to descend in the sequence
of H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana according to the depleted ratio (see Y axis of
Fig. 4). It is shown that the depleted ratio of H. sapiens is from —28.6 to 28.6% and the
depleted ratio of M. musculus is from —24.2 to 24.2%, which means the differences of
nucleotide position preferences between positive and negative samples of the two spe-
cies are significantly different. However, the corresponding depleted ratio of A. thaliana
is from —11.9 to 11.9%. This is in line with our results that the six types of features for
H. sapiens performed better than those for M. musculus, and the features for A. thaliana
performed worst. The sequence differences observed here may account for the perfor-
mance difference of the six types features observed before for the three species.

In addition, this figure can also explain why PSNP, KSPSDP performed well among
the six types of features for both H. sapiens and M. musculus, while PseDNC and 4NF
achieved best accuracy for A. thaliana. Among these six types of features, PSNP and
KSPSDP are the two features that consider position preference information. As men-
tioned before, both H. sapiens and M. musculus have high position preferences of nucle-
otide in RNA sequences, thus it is not surprising that PSNP and KSPSDP performed
best for these two species. On the contrary, the position preferences of RNA sequences
of A. thaliana are not as significant as those of H. sapiens and M. musculus, so the two
features, PSNP and KSPSDP, did not performed as well as they did for H. sapiens and M.
musculus.

KNF, KSNPF and pseDNC are three features related to nucleotide composition of
RNA segments. KNF can describe the local sequence-order information of nucleotide
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 12 of 21

sequences. The idea of KSNPF is to calculate the frequency of sixteen pairs of nucleo-
tides spaced by K-length polynucleotides. With increasing of K, KSNPF feature takes the
position correlation information into account within the nucleotide sequence. PseDNC
feature contains both local and global sequence-order information. The performances of
these three features are determined by the composition difference between positive and
negative samples.

The CPD feature contains nucleotide information at each position of the RNA seg-
ments and it also contains the nucleotide composition information along the RNA
sequences, so that it performs well for all these three species.

According to our results, models based on these selected feature subsets selected by
SFS had made improvements of about two percents in performance when compared
with models based on single feature. As all of these selected feature subsets are combina-
tions of the position specific features and the composition features, the improvements
observed here can further confirm the complementarity between these two groups of
features. It should be noted that we tried a large number of other types of features gener-
ated by iLearn [36] or Pse-in-One [37] toolkits when we designed the input features (data
not shown). The sequence-based features generated by these two toolkits have been
used widely for predicting both RNA post-transcriptional modification sites [38—40] and
post-translational modification sites [41, 42]. Our experimental results demonstrated
that our proposed feature combination in this study yielded satisfactory performance,
which cannot be significantly improved when they were combined with other features.

We summarized the possible reasons for our method to outperform other existing
methods. For the benchmark datasets, we used larger training sets for H. sapiens and M.
musculus than iRNA-m5C which is the latest model for multiple species. Large datasets
are helpful for improvement of the generalization of models. In addition, we added two
types of position specific propensity features, PSNP and KSPSDP. Our results (Tables 2,
3 and 4) demonstrate PSNP and KSPSDP have played key roles in improving method

performance.

Conclusion

In this study, a new computational method, m5CPred-SVM, was developed for predict-
ing m5C sites in RNA sequences. Non-redundant large benchmark datasets were col-
lected for three species, namely H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana. A total of six
types of features, including features related to composition, features related to posi-
tion specific and features related to physicochemical properties were used in building
our models. Results have showed that the features related to position specific are effec-
tive in differentiating m5C sites from non-m5C sites for H. sapiens and M. musculus.
Nucleotide distribution analysis reveals that nucleotide position preferences are signifi-
cant for both H. sapiens and M. musculus, which account for the effectiveness of the
features related to position specific propensity. For the same reason, the features related
to position specific propensity are not that effective for A. thaliana because the nucleo-
tide position preferences are less significant compared with that for the other two spe-
cies. Optimal feature subsets were selected from these six types of features using the
sequential forward feature selection strategy. All the three subsets consisted of feature
related position specific propensity and feature related to nucleotide composition which
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 13 of 21

indicate the complementarity between the features. The performance of our method
m5CPred-SVM was objectively compared with other existing methods by using inde-
pendent test sets. The results showed that our method can offer significantly better per-
formances than all the other existing methods. Finally, a web server was built at https
://zhulab.ahu.edu.cn/m5CPred-SVM to facilitate the access to our method by academic
users to predict the m5C sites in RNA sequences.

Methods

Benchmark datasets

High quality benchmark datasets are extremely important for training and evaluating
machine learning models. In this study, m5C data of three species have been collected
from recently published literature. For A. thaliana, same datasets constructed by Lv et al.
[26] were used for fair comparison. The positive RNA segments which contain m5C site
in the center were collected from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with
the accession number GSE94065 [43]. This dataset contains 6289 positive samples and
6289 negative samples.

The positive samples in the datasets of M. musculus and H. sapiens were obtained from
the works of Yang et al. [44] and Vahid Khoddami et al. [18], respectively. For H. sapiens,
we collected the data from the work of Vahid Khoddami et al. [18]. The file “GSE90963 _
Table_S1-m5C_candidate_sites.xlsx” was downloaded from GEO (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE90963), which recorded both m5C sites infor-
mation by their RBS-seq work and the m5C sites information in other public datasets.
Firstly, we collected the sites with high-threshold in their RBS-seq work. Secondly, we
collected the sites both reported in their RBS-seq work and the public datasets. Totally,
408 m5C sites were collected for H. sapiens. For M. musculus, we collected the data from
Additional file 1: Table $3 of Yang et al’s work [44]. The m5C sites detected in six differ-
ent tissues are all considered as positive examples, thus we obtained 13042 RNA seg-
ments centered with m5C. In order to avoid bias of the datasets, similar sequences in
the datasets were removed using the CD-HIT program [45] with the sequence identity
threshold set at 70%, through which we have obtained 5563 and 269 positive samples for
M. musculus and H. sapiens, respectively. In machine learning, the model performance
may be degraded and the prediction results may be out of balance due to the inconsist-
ency of the amount of data between the positive sample and the negative sample [46,
47]. Therefore, we have randomly selected the same number of negative samples as that
of positive samples for the establishment of the benchmark dataset. It is worth noting
that the redundancy of the negative examples was also removed using CD-HIT with the
sequence identity threshold set at 70%. To verify if the model is sensitive to the selection
of negative samples, we conducted the same procedure to generate other nine negative
subsets for both H. sapiens and M. musculus. We have not done the same thing for A.
thaliana because we did not know the details about the generation of negative samples
of A. thaliana which were obtained from Lv et al’s work.

The benchmark dataset is usually divided into two parts. One is the training dataset
and the other is the independent test set. The training dataset is used for model con-
struction, cross-validation and determination of hyper-parameters of the learning algo-

rithms. The independent test dataset is used to test the performance and generalization
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 14 of 21

ability of the model. In this study, 69 positive samples and 69 negative samples were ran-
domly selected as the independent test dataset and the remaining 200 positive samples
and 200 negative samples were used as the training dataset for H. sapiens. For M. mus-
culus and A. thaliana, 1000 positive samples and 1000 negative samples were randomly
selected as the independent test datasets, and the remaining samples (4563 positive sam-
ples and 4563 negative samples for M. musculus, 5298 positive samples and 5298 nega-
tive samples for A. thaliana) were used as the training datasets.

The fragment of each RNA in the datasets is represented as:

Ri(C) = N_jN_(j-1).--N-1CN,... Na G-1)N3 (1)

where N_, represents the upstream nucleotide of central cytosine and Nj. rresents
the downstream nucleotide of central cytosine. In most previous works [19—22, 26], the
length of the input RNA segments was set to 41 and the m5C site is located in the cen-
tral position 21. In this study, we have also extracted features from the 41 bp long RNA
segments.

The details of the training dataset and the testing dataset are shown in Table 7.

Feature extraction

K-nucleotide frequency (KNF)

As a classic sequence coding feature, K-nucleotide frequency (KNF, also called NC
(Nucleotide composition)) has been widely used to build bioinformatics models [48—50].

Suppose we have an RNA segment R of length L:
R=n)nN2nN3...nj...nNL— {Np (2)

n; indicates the ith nucleotide of R, and it can be any one of the four nucleotide bases
in RNA, ie.n; €{A, C, G, U}. For a given K value, KNF represents the frequency of occur-
rence of each K-mer nucleotide component in the nucleotide sequence. It can be calcu-
lated by the formula (3).

_ N(njn2 .. Nk)

f(ain2...nk) = L—-K+1 (3)

where 14/2...nK indicates a K-mer nucleotide component. It is not difficult to find

that the K-mer nucleotide composition of an RNA sequence is a 4“-dimensional vector

consisting of frequency of each K-mer type. As the value of K increases, the dimension

of the feature vector increases exponentially. For example, when K= 1, four types of sin-
gle nucleotide frequencies can be obtained. We chose the K value of 4 to calculate the
frequency at which 4 nucleotides appears (4NF) according to a previous work [23]. The
RNA fragment can be encoded as:

R(ANF) = [faaaafaaac ---fecuu «+ -fuuuefuuuu!) (4)

K-spaced nucleotide pair frequency (KSNPF)
K-spaced nucleotide pair frequency is another method for encoding RNA sequences
[51]. This method mainly calculates the frequency of 16 pairs of nucleotides separated
by k-length polynucleotides. We use 1; x {K}n2 to represent K-spaced nucleotide pairs.
Since 1 and 12 have four possible values, so there are sixteen (47= 16) possible combi-
nations. For example: AxxC is a two spacer nucleotide pair. The calculation formula of
KSNPF is
f(mx{K}n2) = — (5)

In this work, we tried different K values in order to determine the best KSNPF features
for different species. The selection of K for different species can be found in Additional
file 1: Table S5.

Position-specific nucleotide propensity (PSNP)

In several previous works [27, 28, 51], position-specific nucleotide propensity has been
used to predict the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. This feature is obtained by
calculating the difference in nucleotide frequencies at specific positions between posi-
tive and negative RNA fragments. It was first introduced in Li et al’s work [28]. Accord-

ing to Eq. (1), the RNA fragment can be re-expressed as:
Ry, = N\N2...Nj...No741 (6)

First, we calculated the frequency of the four nucleotides at the i-th position in the
positive sample and the negative sample, respectively. After that, the 4-dimensional
positive vectors and the 4-dimensional negative vectors were combined individually to
obtain two 4 x (2/4 + 1) position-specific occurrence frequency matrices for positive and
negative samples, respectively. The two matrices were named as Mt and M_,M‘ is for
positive samples and M7 is for negative samples. Through Mt and M,we defined the
position-specific nucleotide propensity matrix, denoted as Xpsyp, as below:

K-spaced position-specific dinucleotide propensity (KSPSDP)
Position-specific dinucleotide propensity is defined using the similar procedure to define

PSNP. To calculate this feature, we rewrite Eq. (6) as a dinucleotide:

R, =D,D>...D;...Do, (8)
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 16 of 21

where D, represents the dinucleotide at the i-th position of RNA and has 16 types
of values. By using the similar way for calculating the PSNP feature, we can get the
(16 x 2A) position-specific dinucleotide propensity (PSDP) matrix.

To calculate K-spaced position-specific dinucleotide propensity, nj x {K}n2 was
used to represent K-spaced nucleotide pairs. PSDP is a specific case for KSPSDP when
K equals 0. In this work, we tried different K values to determine the best KSPSDP
features for different species. The selection of K values for different species can be
found in Additional file 1: Table S6.

Pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC)

The pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC) has been used to represent an
RNA sequence with a discrete model or vector which can keep considerable sequence
order information, especially the global or long-range sequence order information
[20, 26, 52, 53]. In this study, we used PseDNC (K=2 for PseKNC) to encode the
RNA segments. Three physicochemical properties, free energy, hydrophilicity and
stacking energy were used to generate features of PseDNC. The values of these three
physicochemical properties of 16 dinucleotides are shown in Table 8.

Chemical property with density (CPD)

The four types of nucleotides in RNA (A (adenine), U (uracil), G(guanine) and
C(cytosine)) can be divided into three categories according to their chemical struc-
tures and internal binding characteristics [54]. Considering the ring structure of the
nucleotide, C and U are pyrimidines with one ring, while A and G are purines with
two rings. As for the secondary structure, the hydrogen bonds of A and U are weak,

while the hydrogen bonds of G and C are strong. In terms of chemical functionality,

U and G are classified as keto groups, while A and C are in amino groups. These
three aspects of chemical properties can be represented as a three-dimensional vec-
tor (x, y, Z), where x, y, z represent the ring structure, the hydrogen bond, and the
chemical functionality of the nucleotides respectively. In this way, each nucleotide

ni = (Xi; Vis Zi) in an RNA sequence can be encoded as:

J lifnje{A,G} J lifnje{A,C} — __ J lifnje{A, U}
i=) Oifnje{U, C}’?! — ) Oifnje{U, G}’~! — ) Oifnje{C, G} (9)

Thus, the four types of nucleotide, A, U, G and C, can be encoded as (1,1,1), (0,0,1),
(0,1,0), (1,0,0), respectively.

In order to better represent the distribution of each nucleotide in the RNA sequence, the
density of a nucleotide, which describes the frequency of the nucleotide occurring before

current position, is denoted as:
1 lifnj=p
— S } . |) = J
2 in AFL = (orm ap (10)

where d, is the density of nucleotide, i is the current position of RNA sequence, |N;|is the
length of the ith prefix string {71, 12,...,;} in the sequence, and p is the symbol of {A, U,
G, C}.

By integrating the nucleotide chemical property and the distribution of each nucleotide
in the RNA sequence, a (4 x &)-dimensional CPD feature vector can be generated, where &
is the length of the RNA segment.

Support vector machine

Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular statistical learning method and has been exten-
sively used to build bioinformatics models [23, 50, 55-58] because of its high efficiency
and robust output. In this study, we used the MATLAB function FITCSVM to build our
models. SVM uses kernel functions to project low-dimensional data into high-dimensional
space. A few different kernel functions can be used in training. In this work, the radial basis
kernel function was selected with two hyper parameters (box constraint and kernel scale) to
be used with FITCSVM function. The two parameters were optimized by a grid search with
box constraint from 2~° to 2!° and kernel scale from 2~!° to 2°.

Evaluation criteria
Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the generalization performance based on
the training dataset. For the ten-fold cross-validation, the training dataset was divided into
ten roughly equal-sized subsets with a stratified sampling, and then one subset was used
as a validation set whereas the remaining nine subsets were combined for training. This
process was repeated ten times with ten models built and validated. Finally, the average
performance was obtained. In this study, the ten-fold cross-validation was used for feature
selection, parameter optimization and classifier comparison.

Different metrics were used to assess the model performance, namely accuracy (Acc),
sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), precision (Pre), Matthews correlation coefficient (Mcc)
and Fl1-score. The specific formulas are as below:
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:489 Page 18 of 21

TP

 

Sen = TPLEN EN
Spe = TNLFP
Pre = +pipp
Acc = TP+TN (11)
— "TP+EN+FP--EN
Mcc = TP x*TN—EP* EN
JV(TP+EP)(TP+EN)(TN-+EP)(TN+EN)
— (QxTP+EP+EN)

where, TP, TN, FP and FN represent the number of true-positive (m5C sites that were
predicted as m5C sites), true-negative (non-m5C sites that were predicted as non-m5C
sites), false-positive (non-m5C sites that were predicted as m5C sites) and false-negative
(m5C sites that were predicted as non-m5C sites) samples, respectively.

In addition, we draw the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) [59]
and precision recall curve (PRC curve) [60], to evaluate the performances of different
models. ROC curve demonstrates the relationship between sensitivity and 1-specific-
ity at different thresholds, and PRC curve reflects the trend of precision changing with
recall. These two curves can be used to evaluate the predictive capability of the pro-
posed method across entire range of decision values. The areas under these two curves
(AUROC and AUPRC) were also calculated to quantify the model performance. AUROC
and AUPRC have value ranging from 0 to 1. The closer the value approximate 1, the bet-
ter the model performance is.

Feature selection

There are three major methods for feature selection: Filter, Wrapper and Embedded. We
have chosen the sequence forward selection algorithm (SFS) under Wrapper as the fea-
ture selection algorithm in this study. Six types of features are generated and constitute
the high-dimensional feature vector of each sample. The following specific operations of
SFS were used to achieve a compact and efficient feature subset: in the first round, the
ten-fold cross-validation results were obtained for models built on each of the six types
of features. The best performing feature type was selected according to the AUROC
value and then proceeded to the next round of calculation. In the second round, the
remaining five types of features were added to the best performing feature type selected
in the first round. Similarly, the best performing feature combination was again selected
according to the AUROC value and proceeded to the next round of calculation. This
process continued until AUROC converged. The subset with the highest AUROC value
was considered as the optimal feature subset.
