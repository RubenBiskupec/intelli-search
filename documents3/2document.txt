Abstract

Computational protein—ligand docking is well-known to be prone to inaccuracies in input receptor structures, and it is
challenging to obtain good docking results with computationally predicted receptor structures (e.g. through homology
modeling). Here we introduce a fragment-based docking method and test if it reduces requirements on the accuracy of an
input receptor structures relative to non-fragment docking approaches. In this method, small rigid fragments are docked first
using AutoDock Vina to generate a large number of favorably docked poses spanning the receptor binding pocket. Then a
graph theory maximum clique algorithm is applied to find combined sets of docked poses of different fragment types onto
which the complete ligand can be properly aligned. On the basis of these alignments, possible binding poses of complete
ligand are determined. This docking method is first tested for bound docking on a series of Cytochrome P450 (CY P450)
enzyme-substrate complexes, in which experimentally determined receptor structures are used. For all complexes tested,
ligand poses of less than | A root mean Square deviations (RMSD) from the actual binding positions can be recovered. Then
the method is tested for unbound docking with modeled receptor structures for a number of protein—ligand complexes from
different families including the very recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protease. For
all complexes, poses with RMSD less than 3 A from actual binding positions can be recovered. Our results suggest that
for docking with approximately modeled receptor structures, fragment-based methods can be more effective than common
complete ligand docking approaches.

in structure-based drug design [1—3]. Docking calculations
require prior knowledge of the three-dimensional structure
of the receptor protein. It is not uncommon that a suitable
experimental structure of the target receptor is unavailable
and one has to manage with a computationally modeled
one. Most commonly, the modeled structures are obtained
through comparative modeling, 1.e., by using existing experi-
mental structures of homologous proteins as templates for
model construction [4]. Besides comparative modeling, de
novo protein structure prediction is an increasingly promis-
ing approach to obtaining modeled receptor structures, given
the recent significant progresses making use of deep learning
[5]. Despite method advancements, the quality of modeled
receptor structures cannot yet match that of high-resolution
experimental structures. This is especially true when a
homology model has been constructed based on a template
protein sharing relatively low sequence identity with the tar-
get. In such a situation, the sequence alignment between the

Q) Springer

target and the template protein contains frequent insertions
and deletions, causing the accuracy of the resulting structure
model to deteriorate severely [4]. Given the large number
of proteins that can potentially serve as drug targets but do
not have crystal structures, it is of wide interest to consider
computational docking of ligands with modeled receptor
structures that are of relatively low accuracy.

Most current docking methods have not been tailored
to consider homology models as input receptor structures.
Instead, they have usually been optimized by considering
benchmarks such as bound docking, in which experimen-
tal structures of receptors in complexes with target ligands
have been used as input for docking [6—11]. As a result,
the performance of docking strongly depends on the input
receptor structure. It has been well-known that with usual
docking approaches, results obtained by using apo- or mod-
eled receptor structures are significantly worse than results
obtained by using high resolution ligand-bound (holo-)
experimental receptor structures [12—14]. The high sensi-
tivity of computational docking to input receptor structures
is also evidenced by the fact that when docking is applied to
screen the same diverse ligand library for the same receptor,
different receptor structures yielded different results [15].
This can be explained by the fact that the receptor adopts
various conformations in order to establish favorable inter-
actions with different ligands [16], and only one input con-
formational state (Sometimes with local variations such as
sidechain rotations) can be considered in one docking run.
Because of this strong dependency on receptor structure,
computational docking ideally should use input receptor
structures coming from high quality experimental studies,
preferably determined in complex with a ligand that is simi-
lar to the target small molecules that are considered for dock-
ing [17]. On the other hand, a docking method that perform
well on such inputs does not necessarily lead to the same
performance in applications that have to rely on less accurate
receptor structures, such as homology models.

One possible way to reduce the above sensitivity to the
input structure is to consider the structural flexibility of the
receptor. Developments in docking programs have been
made in past to allow a certain degree of receptor flexibil-
ity by including sidechain variations in e.g. AutoDock [18],
GOLD [19], FlexX [11], and RosettaLigand [20]. Although
these approaches can help in achieving better results in
cases such as docking into the apo-structure of a receptor,
they may still not be sufficient for treating modeled recep-
tor structures, which usually contain varied extents of pep-
tide backbone deviations from the actual receptor structure.
Ensemble docking is an approach in which backbone vari-
ations are included by considering as docking targets mul-
tiple receptor conformations generated using MD simula-
tions [21]. However, because of the common insufficiency
of using only a small number of conformations to represent a

Q) Springer

Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design (2020) 34:1237-1259

vast number of possible conformations [22], there 1s always
high risks of missing from the ensemble conformations
accommodated to the binding of particular ligands. Besides
these limitations, the explicit consideration of receptor flex-
ibility in docking significantly increases the computational
costs, which may make the virtual screening of large ligand
libraries computationally too expensive. In addition to recep-
tor flexibility, consideration of ligand flexibility is another
approach of unbound docking. GalaxyDock3, for example,
is a protein—ligand docking approach which considers full
ligand conformational flexibility but the protein conforma-
tion is fixed at crystal structure [23].

In the current study, we will explore another approach
that can potentially reduce the sensitivity to input receptor
structure of computational docking. This approach uses frag-
ment docking. We note that fragment docking has emerged
over the past decades as a mainstream paradigm in ligand-
protein docking and ligand discovery [24—26]. Due to their
small sizes, rigid chemical fragments can be used to probe
the configurational space inside a binding pocket more effi-
ciently, hence allowing different regions of the pocket to be
systematically explored [27, 28]. From the perspective of
cheminformatics, the chemical complexity of a fragment is
often lower than that of larger compounds, which simplifies
the interpretation of structure-activity relationship (SAR)
data and may consequently accelerates experimental lead
optimization [24, 29]. A number of computational tech-
niques exploiting fragment docking are already available.
Examples include software like LUDI [30], GLIDE [10],
LigBuilder [31], SEED [32], and web servers like ACFIS
[33]. For unbound docking studies, a fragment mapping
program, Fsubsite, has been validated on apo-structures of
CDK2 [34].

The reasons that fragment docking may better tolerate
structure inaccuracies of homology receptor models than
complete ligand docking include the following. Consider
the docking of a large ligand with a modeled structure of
its cognate receptor. For the docking to be successful, every
part of the ligand in its correct binding pose need to inter-
act favorably with the modeled receptor structure, at least
without any severe steric clashes. If we refer the immediate
receptor environment of a part or a fragment of the ligand as
a subpocket, any inaccuracy of any subpocket structure that
leads to bad ligand-protein interactions (e.g. severe steric
clashes) will lead to docking failure. In addition, the cova-
lent connections between different fragments of the ligand
translate into stringent constraints on the relative geometries
between the subpockets. Structure inaccuracies that lead to
errors in these relative geometries also prohibit successful
docking. If not the complete ligand but only small fragments
comprising the ligand are separately docked, the modeling
errors at one subpocket will not affect the proper docking of
fragments at other subpockets. In addition, the constraints on
Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design (2020) 34:1237-1259

the relative geometries between different subpockets accom-
modating different fragments may be relaxed, as the docked
fragments are not covalently connected. We expect that these
properties of fragment docking may be exploited to increase
the tolerance of structure inaccuracies when docking a multi-
fragments ligand into a modeled receptor structure.

In our proposed approach, after obtaining possible docked
poses of fragments, a graph theory algorithm is applied to
align a complete ligand with the binding poses of its com-
posing fragments. Graph theory-based methods have been
adopted in various biological and bioinformatics studies
previously, including metabolic pathway analysis [35, 36],
protein flexibility predictions [37], protein side chain pre-
dictions [38], secondary structure motif comparisons [39],
calcium binding site predictions [40] and more. The applica-
tion of graph theory in the current work has been inspired by
earlier studies using graph theory to find maximum common
substructures between two structures [41-44].

Our proposed approach is benchmarked using pro-
tein—ligand complexes in which the proteins belong to dif-
ferent families, the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes,
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), chaperone, bromodo-
mains and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-Cov-2) protease. We have chosen protein families
of different sequence length and binding pockets to better
understand how our strategy works. The CYP450 enzymes
are found in genomes of virtually all organisms. In humans,
they are involved in detoxification of various drugs [45].
In plants, they are involved in biosynthesis of various sec-
ondary metabolites and thus have numerous applications
in industrial biotechnology [46]. The prediction of ligand
binding poses using modeled CYP450 proteins is of practi-
cal relevance for the prediction of substrate selectivity and
reaction site selectivity for CYP450 proteins with unknown
structures. The GPCR proteins are important regulatory
elements in a wide spectrum of normal and pathological
procedures [47]. They are one of the most important fami-
les of therapeutic targets for small molecule drugs [48,
49]. Chaperones play a vital role in the stabilization of an
unfolded protein [50]. Bromodomain (BRD) is an evolution-
ary conserved domain with an approximate length of 110
amino acids. Proteins containing BRD regulate the process
of gene expression [51]. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus
that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
worldwide [52, 53].

Materials and methods

Two types of docking were carried out i.e. bound and
unbound. In bound docking crystal structures from PDB
with bound ligands were used. Whereas in unbound dock-
ing, homology models were built and used to dock native

1239

ligands. Scripts and source codes to carry out the calcula-
tions can be downloaded from http://biocomp.ustc.edu.cn/
servers/download_others.php#scripts-for-small-mol-frag-
docking. Pymol or discovery studio visualizer have been
used to carry out visualization [54, 55]. Origin software was
used to plot graphs [56].

Structures of the receptor proteins

In bound docking, the receptor structures have been extracted
from the experimentally determined PDB structures of
the respective complexes (Table 2). In unbound docking,
the receptor structures have been either from a structure
complexed with a different ligand or, more interestingly,
constructed using the homology modeling program Mod-
eller [57]. Homology models of eleven CYP450 proteins,
CYP2B4 (PDB id Isuo, 3me6), CYP2A6 (2fdu), CYP3A4
(PDB id 3ual, 4d7d), CYP1A1 (PDB id 418v), CYP1O5AS1
(PDB id 4oqr), CYP119 (PDB id 4wqj), CYPBM3 (PDB id
47f8), CYP126A1 (PDB id 5li8), CYP4B1 (PDB id 6c94),
four GPCR proteins, 5-HT1B (PDB id 4iar), 5-HT2B (PDB
id 4nc3), GRK5 (PDB id 4wnk), GRK2 (PDB id 5he0),
two chaperone proteins, Hsc70/Bag1 (PDB id 3fzm), Hsp
90-alpha (PDB id 6f1n), two bromodomains, namely, human
BRD2 (PDB id 4a9m), human ATAD2 (PDB id 51j0) and
one SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB id 6witt) have been
constructed. Structure templates for comparative modeling
have been identified by sequence BLAST against the PDB
database. Details of targets and templates are presented
in Table 1. Templates have been chosen on the basis of
sequence identity. The protein sequence of a target receptor
was downloaded from UniProt database (https://www.unipr
ot.org/) and protein blast available at https://blast.ncbi.nIm.
nih.gov was run for the given sequence against proteins in
PDB excluding the target protein. The purpose for building
homology models was to assess our methodology in case of
poor models or where it was hard to find a good template.
Therefore, templates with sequence identity above 85% were
ignored. For 14 out of 20 systems, templates with sequence
identity of less than 60% were chosen (Table 1). We also
included templates with sequence identity as low as 19%
and 25%. Besides sequence identity, query coverage was
also taken into account and we made sure that it was more
than 50%. For each receptor, twenty initial models were con-
structed based on a selected template. The initial models
were optimized and refined using molecular dynamics with
simulated annealing. Then one model with the minimum
DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score [58] was
selected and used for unbound docking. Further details about
model quality are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Analysis was carried out using the PROCHECK program
available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/
PROCHECK/.

docking. Polar hydrogens were added in molecules before
charges were computed. In case of fragments, SMARTS
for each fragment was saved using MarvinSketch [62] and
resulting structures were stored in PDB format. These
rigid fragments were then converted to pdbqt format using
AutoDock GUI as explained. In case of rigid docking using
complete ligands, the receptor molecule was kept rigid
whereas ligand was flexible with rotations in rotatable
bonds switched on. Cyclic portions of ligands were treated
as rigid. The heme cofactor in CYP450 binding pocket
was considered as a rigid part of the receptor. For flexible
docking, torsions were chosen in the receptor pocket resi-
dues which were saved as flexible pdbqt and the rest of the
protein was saved as rigid pdbat. In case of bound docking,
the center of the grid for docking was defined based on the
information of bound ligand. For unbound docking, pocket
residues of the modeled structure were identified and then
center coordinates were computed. The same center was
used for all fragments of one ligand. The grid size was set
to 15015015 in xyz directions for fragment docking so
that fragments can span the entire pocket. All this infor-
mation was written to a configuration file to be given as
an input to AutoDock Vina [18] for carrying out docking.
For each configuration 25 docking runs were carried out
to obtain up to 500 binding poses.

Poses generated in the previous steps were clustered
based on their atomic Cartesian coordinates using k-means
clustering [63], with the number of clusters determined
using the so-called “elbow” method [64]. After clustering,

Obtaining docked poses of complete ligands

A complete ligand is aligned to combined sets of the docked
fragment poses using the following protocol. It makes use
of the graph-theory algorithm for determining maximum
cliques [65, 66] to identity sets of matches between frag-
ments contained in the ligand and the docked fragment poses
(Fig. 2).

To describe the method in graph theory terms, we define
two sets, Q and T, respectively,

QuerysetQ = {q),q9,---. dn} (1)

TargetsetT = {t), toy... ty} (2)

Each element q; of Q corresponds to a docked fragment
pose, associated with the corresponding chemical type of
the fragment and the atomic positions. For convenience, we
refer the chemical type of an element q; as ®(q;), and the
set of atomic positions as R(q;). For each type of fragment,
chemically matching substructures in a complete ligand can
be identified. We used the RDKit cheminformatics tools to
perform the substructure matching [60], by representing the
chemical structures of the fragments as SMARTS strings
[62] which are matched against a complete ligand. Each ele-
ment t, of the set T in formula (2) corresponds to a part of

the ligand that chemically matches a fragment, its chemical
type noted as ®(t,) and the set of atomic positions as R(t,).

An auxiliary graph G, representing the compatibility
between the elements in the sets Q and T is defined as below.
Each vertex of G,’s corresponds to a combination of two
elements associated with the same chemical type, one from
Q and the other from T, namely,

Vertex (vj) = (q;,t,). qj EQ, ET, and ®(q;) = ®(t,)
(3)

An edge between two vertices vj, and vj is defined in G,
if and only if the following conditions are met: 1 4 j,k 4 1,
and the two sets of atomic positions R(q;) UR(q,) and
R(t,) U R(t) can be well-aligned against each other. A
clique in the graph G, is a fully connected (or complete)
subgraph in which there is an edge between every vertex
in the subgraph to every other vertex in the same subgraph.
A maximal clique is a clique which cannot be extended to
include new vertices without violating the full connection
requirement. The maximal cliques of G, can be found with
the Bron and Kerbosch algorithm [67]. Each maximal clique
corresponds to an alignment between at least two fragments
contained in the ligand with the same number of docked
fragment poses. The definition of edges in the compatibility
graph guarantees that in the alignment, a ligand fragment
is only matched to a docked fragment of the same chemical
type. In addition, all the inter-fragment relative geometries
in the complete ligand are consistent with the relative geom-
etries between the respectively matched docked poses.

In the next step, for the aligned set of fragments defined
by each clique, a rigid body geometry transformation is cal-
culated to simultaneously superimpose the different aligned
fragments contained in the ligand onto the correspondingly
matched docked fragment poses. The resulting transforma-
tion is applied to the entire ligand, generating a possible
binding pose of the complete ligand inside the binding
pocket. To remove potential local steric clashes in the result-
ing ligand-receptor complex, the complex is subsequently
energy minimized by 300 steepest descent steps using UCSF
Chimera [68]. All hydrogen atoms were added prior to this
minimization step. The minimized structures were scored
separately by two scoring functions, namely, Cyscore [69]
and DSX [70].

Results and discussion

Binding poses of fragments generated by fragment
docking

The PDB ids and ligand structures of the cytochrome
P450 protein—ligand complexes used as test dataset for
bound docking are given in Table 2. The ligands in these
Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design (2020) 34:1237-1259

complexes are of different sizes ranging from 12 to 36
heavy atoms. Fragments generated by applying the BRICS
method to each ligand are given in the same table.

Docking the ligand fragments into the binding pocket
of the respective receptor structure led to a large num-
ber of binding poses for each fragment type. Inspecting
the poses suggested that by considering 25 docking runs
for each fragment, the positioning of the fragments in the
actual ligand-receptor complexes can usually be closely
reproduced by one or more docked poses. On the other
hand, a large number of docked poses are redundant, 1.e.,
of similar structures. Therefore, following fragment dock-
ing, the docked poses for a given fragment were clustered
and one representative pose from each cluster was cho-
sen to be used for the subsequent steps. RMSDs of the
representative poses from the respective ligand parts in
the actual complex structures were computed. For every
fragment, the set of representative poses included at least
one experimental binding position-like pose. This indi-
cates that because of the small sizes and conformational
rigidity of the fragments, it is relatively easy for stand-
ard docking protocols to thoroughly explore and identify
their favorable binding positions inside a receptor pocket.
In Fig. 3, the experimental-like representative poses of
fragments are shown together with the containing ligands
in experimental binding poses inside the corresponding
binding pockets.

We observed that the experimental-like docked poses of
fragments do not always correspond to the docked poses
associated with the lowest energy scores. Thus if we only
retain a small number of top-ranking poses from the dock-
ing results without the clustering step to remove redundant
poses, we could have missed the near native binding poses
from the retained poses. Thus the clustering step minimized
the chance of losing native like poses while retaining only
a small number of docked poses for subsequent process-
ing. We note that as the fragments are small and can form
only reduced number of specific interactions within the
binding pockets, a fragment acting as a probe can sample
an entire binding pocket more efficiently compared with a
complete ligand. Despite this, for a large ligand comprising
many different fragments, there can still be chances that for
some fragments, the respective near native poses are missed
because of the lack of specific interactions for strong binding
(for example, in Fig. 3, result 9f, docking of the phenyl frag-
ment generated poses distant from the native binding posi-
tion of the fragment in the complete ligand). For this reason,
in the subsequent graph-theory-based fragment-ligand align-
ment step, an accepted alignment is required to cover not
all but as many as possible the fragments that comprise the
ligand. In this way, near native poses of the complete ligand
can still be produced making use of the subset of fragments
whose near native poses have been generated and retained.

structures. For some complexes, the total number of poses
generated from cliques is quite high due to the large numbers
of representative fragment poses chosen in the previous step.
The RMSD for every pose from the experimental ligand
position was calculated, and low RMSD poses have been
found for every complex. Figure 4 shows the superimposed
structures of the minimum RMSD docked ligands superim-
posed with the actual bound ligands inside the binding pock-
ets. These results confirm that the fragment-based docking
approach thoroughly searches for possible binding positions
of complete ligands inside the binding pockets.

Unbound docking

For unbound docking, the fragment-based docking approach
have been applied to dock the ligands contained in 20 PDB
complexes (eleven CY P450-substrate, four GPCR, two chap-
erons, two bromodomains and one SARS-Cov-2 complex,
see Table |) with receptor structures generated by com-
parative modeling. The PDB IDs of the template structures
as well their sequence identities with respect to the actual
receptor proteins are also given in Table |. Possible bind-
ing poses of complete ligands have been generated with the
fragment-based approach described above. For simplic-
ity, we have only aligned and transformed each ligand in
its actual bound conformation, as present in the respective
PDB structures. In real unbound docking, it is usually not
difficult to first systematically explore the conformational
space of a small molecule ligand to identify its low energy
conformational states, and then separately align each confor-
mation with the docked fragment poses by the graph theory
algorithm.

The fragment-based docking results are compared with
those obtained by direct docking of complete ligands
with AutoDock Vina. The latter calculations included
rigid receptor docking, in which the receptor structures
were not allowed to change, as well as flexible docking,
in which the side chains of pocket residues were allowed
to rotate. Table 4 shows the minimum RMSDs of docked
poses from the experimental bound structures for different
docking approaches. The results suggest that for several
complexes, while direct docking of the complete ligands
was not able to yield any experimental result-like binding
poses, the fragment-based approach was able to produce
poses that were of relatively small RMSDs from experi-
mental results. Figures 5 and 6 show the docked minimum
RMSD binding poses in comparison with respective actual
ligand positions in respective experimental complexes.
The results obtained by the fragment-based approach and
the direct docking approach are compared side by side.
Results clearly indicate that the proposed fragment-based
strategy outperforms complete ligand docking with Auto-
Dock Vina, with all complexes having RMSD within 3 A

the other hand, performed quite well under circumstances
where the protein size is big and they are bound to large
ligands e.g. CYP450, GPCR and SARS-CoV-2.

Different modeled receptor structures (4zf8_model,
3fzm_model, lsuo_model) were considered for which
results were compared between two different homology
models generated via the same respective templates (for
the quality of these models see supplementary Table S1).
Only slight variations in RMSD (<0.5 A) were observed
(Table 5).

In addition to docking with modeled structures, cross
docking analysis was also performed. For this purpose, three
protein—ligand complexes were considered. CYP2B4 is pre-
sent in various conformations in protein data bank bound
with different ligands. We took Isuo bound with cpz ligand,
3me6 bound with cge ligand and 3rla co-crystallized with
tb2 ligand. Every ligand was docked with every receptor
and RMSD from the native ligand conformation was calcu-
lated (Table 6). All the ligands were well aligned with the
native conformations with RMSD less than 2 A except for
one ligand tb2 which yielded RMSD of 2.4 A when cross
docked with I suo receptor. These results clearly indicate that

the proposed methodology works efficiently for unbound
docking.

Scoring the docked poses of complete ligands

Before subjected to scoring, each ligand-receptor complex
was first energy-minimized using Chimera [68]. As the
transformed ligands may be involved in unacceptable steric
clashes with the protein environment, this local optimization
step is necessary. Two scoring functions have been consid-
ered: Cyscore [69] and DSX [70].

Figure 7 shows the RMSDs from respective experimental
ligand positions of the top 10% scored conformations for
bound docking. Evaluated with the Cyscore scoring function,
for 9 of the 10 complexes, the 10% top scoring binding poses
included one or more experimental result-like ones. Evalu-
ated with the DSX scoring function, experimental result-like
binding poses were included in the 10% top scoring bind-
ing poses for all complexes (Fig. 7b). Because of inaccura-
cies in both the structural models and the scoring functions,
some false binding poses were unavoidably ranked top along
with true binding poses. Visual inspection of several such
false poses inside binding pockets reveal multiple favorable

high RMSD can be attributed to flipped conformations. The
molecule is completely flipped along its axis such that the
reaction center is pointed in opposite direction (Fig. 8). In
native pose la, imidazole is pointing towards heme group
but in pose 1b the molecule has flipped by 180 degrees ori-

ligand molecule has flipped along two axis, moving benzene
ring away from the heme group, and flipping the carbony] at
the same time. For pose 4b, we can see the flip along both
axis. The good ligand-receptor shape-complementarity as
well as the favorable local interactions of the false poses
cause difficulty the scoring functions to tell them from the
true poses. In some cases, there could be the possibility that
not all possible binding poses have been captured in the cor-
responding crystallographic structures, as for some CY P450
enzymes, a ligand may bind in different conformations and
leading to more than one reaction sites on the ligand.

Fig.9 RMSD distributions of unbound docking results for top 20% hits according to a Cyscore b DSX ranking

Figure 9 displays the RMSDs from respective experimen-
tal ligand positions of the top 20% scored conformations for
unbound docking. In total 20 complexes have been consid-
ered for unbound docking. The Cyscore evaluation reveals
that for 12 of 20 complexes, the top 20% scoring binding
poses included one or more experimental result-like poses
(within 3 A). The DSX score evaluation yielded one or more
experimental result-like poses for 14 of 20 complexes in top
20% results. In general, the accuracy of scoring functions
was lower for ranking the unbound docking results than the
bound docking results. This can be attributed to the fact that
the unbound docked complexes originated from approxi-
mately modeled structures.

Considering multiple ligand conformations

To test the fragment-based docking approach in a more
realistic scenario, we further considered different ligand
conformations. Two complexes (PDB IDs 5li8 and 4wnk)
have been considered as examples. The respective ligands
are named as KKK and 453, as in the corresponding
PDB records. For each ligand, we generated 15 different

D) Springer

conformers (Figs. 10 and 11) using the ETKDG (Experimen-
tal-Torsion basic knowledge distance geometry) algorithm
[71] contained in RDKit. Each of the resulting conformers
were separately aligned to the docked fragment poses using
the graph theory algorithm. Each conformer was also used
for direct docking with AutoDock Vina. Complete ligand
docking results for the GPCR complex (ligand 453) are as
good as the fragment-based docking results. However, for
the CYP450 complex (ligand KKK), fragment-based dock-
ing yielded much better RMSD results (Table 7). The bind-
ing pocket of the GPCR receptor is comparatively exposed,
which makes it easier for complete ligand docking to find
correct ligand orientation. On the other hand, for the dock-
ing of a relatively large ligand (ligand KKK) in to the buried
pocket of the CYP450 receptor, direct docking of complete
ligands seems to be rather challenging, especially with mod-
eled receptor structures.

The resulting docked poses were also energy minimized
and then scored using the DSX scoring function [70]. Fig-
ure 12 shows that for 10 of 15 KKK and 453 conformations,
the top 20% scoring poses included one or more binding poses
close to native (<3 A).

Conclusions

In this article, we introduce a fragment-based docking
method in which binding poses of complete ligands are
determined based on alignments with docked fragment

1255

poses. A graph theory maximum clique algorithm is adopted
to identify proper alignments between a multi-fragment
ligand and a set of docked poses of various types of frag-
ments. Bound docking of 10 CYP450 complexes verified
that this fragment-based approach yields valid docking
results as other established docking methods: for all the
tested complexes, experimental-like binding positions of
complete ligands can be successfully recovered. Then the
fragment-based method was challenged with unbound dock-
ing, in which the input receptor structures were not from
experimental complexes, but constructed through homology
modeling. For all the complexes tested, binding poses with
RMSD less than 3 A from actual ligand binding positions
could be recovered by the fragment-based approach, with
12 complexes having RMSD within 2 A. For comparison,
direct docking of complete ligands into the same modeled
receptor pockets generated the binding positions in 12 of 20
complexes with RMSD <3 A,

The relatively poor performance of unbound docking of
complete ligands are consistent with the well-known fact
that conventional docking approaches are highly sensitive
to receptor structures, making unbound docking, espe-
cially docking with modeled receptor structures, a chal-
lenging task. The graph theory based fragment docking
approach proposed here is intended to be less sensitive to
receptor structures. In this new approach, different regions
of a binding pocket are probed more systematically and
thoroughly by small, rigid fragments. By retrieving pos-
sible binding positions of complete ligands through align-
ments with the docked fragments, one avoids difficulties
associated with moving a relatively large ligand within the
limited volume of a binding pocket according to an energy
function. Because the different sub-pockets (the favorable
binding sites for different fragments) are searched sepa-
rately and independently, the requirements on the modeled
receptor pocket to be accurate as a whole Is efficiently
reduced. Additionally, the relative geometries between
the docked fragment poses are far less restricted than the
relative geometries between the covalently linked frag-
ments in a complete ligand. This may lead to better toler-
ance of inaccuracies in the relative geometries between
different regions of a modeled receptor pocket. Compared
with existed flexible docking approaches, the graph-based
approach does not require extensive sampling of receptor

structures, which is time consuming and convergence or
thorough coverage of different states important for ligand
binding is not easily achieved. Our graph based docking
strategy is less sensitive to receptor inaccuracies and hence
gave good results even with poor quality structure models.
However, with this method, one will end up in having mul-
tiple similar poses that need to be filtered out. In addition,
this method requires prior knowledge of possible binding
conformations to pick the best binding pose. In practice,
this should not cause serious problems as the conforma-
tional space of a ligand are usually not enormous and a set
of candidate binding conformations may be generated from
systematic conformational analysis. These theoretical con-
siderations and the actual docking results taken together,
the fragment-based docking approach proposed here pro-
vides a useful new method for computational ligand dock-
ing with approximate, modeled receptor structure.
