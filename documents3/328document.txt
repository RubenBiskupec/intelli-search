Abstract

Nowadays, the design and construction of efficient internet of things (lols) has become a new Strategies for
improving living quality of all aspects. Emerging as one of the most significant extension of medical loTs, wireless
body area networks (WBANSs) is capable of monitoring crucial physiological and behavioral information through
wearable sensors, offering a new paradigm for the next-generation healthcare systems. As a matter of fact, due to the
inherent open wireless communicating characteristics, data security and user privacy issues of WBANs have attracted
attentions from both industry and academia. So far, lots of relevant researches emphasize on secure transmission and
privacy protection. However, the computation and communication limitations for individual WBAN sensor have not
been taken proper consideration. Moreover, the implementation of cloud computing infrastructure has provided
WBANSs with superior transmission and processing qualities. Emphasizing on the above issues, this paper construct a

pairing-free authentication and sensor cooperation scheme in cloud-assisted WBANs, where most of the practical
requirements for WBAN sensors could be satisfied. Our design guarantee the sensor anonymity in the whole
transmission session. Note that our design offers pairing-free validation procedure followed with active sensor
cooperation, which is suitable for massive sensor scenarios. The security analysis proves that our designed scheme is
capable of achieving desired security properties and offer adequate resistances to the charted malicious attacks.
Meanwhile, security comparison demonstrates that the proposed protocol is secure compared with the

state-of-the-arts.

Introduction

Wireless Body Network (WBAN) is considered to be the
basic infrastructure of loT-based healthcare system in the
future. Recent rapid advances in wireless communications
and sensor manufacturing have accelerated the explosive
popularity of WBAN applications and services. WBAN
provides real-time, reliable medical monitoring for spe-
cific users (Liu et al. 2014). In the medical fields, WBAN
can be used to continuously monitor the patient’s health
and to send menstrual information to medical institu-

tions such as hospitals, community clinics, and first aid
centers. In this case, doctors can provide timely medical
help after performing the remote diagnosis of the patient
(Zhang et al. 2020). In addition, pre-warning and pre-
ventive measures against certain diseases can be imple-
mented. Today, WBAN is committed to state-of-the-art
communication and data processing strategies such as 5G
network and cloud computing technologies to be used in
heterogeneous IoT environments, which could exchange
high-speed, stable data with centralized servers (Hu et al.
2016; Zhou et al. 2020).

In order to meet different needs in different practical sit-
uations, WBAN’s architecture varies widely. The typically
designed WBAN consists of the heathcare center (HC),

the personal controller (PC), and many wireless medical
sensors. These sensors can perform important biomedical
information collection in various ways (Ji et al. 2018; Sam-
bandam et al. 2020). Therefore, appropriate physiological
data related to heart rate, body temperature and blood
pressure can be measured separately through sensors. The
collected personal physical information is then sent to the
HC and processed. Based on this, regular medical services
can be provided to large numbers of patients simultane-
ously (Zhang et al. 2013). It is important to note that HC is
considered as a secure data center and an effective entity
responsible for distributing core information. Hence, we
assume that all participating sensors and PC secret key
information is always safely stored at the HC side. Per-
sonal controller (PC) is a portable device used to aggregate
personal sensor data (Yuan et al. 2020). Sensitive biomed-
ical data is then transmitted to the remote server via PC.
WBAN sensors (includes wearable and implantable sen-
sors) are the low-power wireless medical devices subject
to computing, communication, power supply, and storage
(Liu et al. 2020; Anjum et al. 2020). On the other hand,
increasing the calculation and transmission load on the
sensor side will release more energy into heat and even-
tually damage the human organs. As a result, low-cost
operations should be performed in WBAN sensors side.

In actual WBAN scenarios, the frequent data exchange
between the sensor and the PC is carried out in the
open wireless environment, and the important biomet-
ric data transmitted is easily affected by various security
attacks and privacy risks (Yang and Chang 2009; Li et
al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020; Xiong and Qin 2015). In
this case, advanced security strategies and privacy protec-
tion technologies are essential to WBANs. The effective
authentication mechanism between wireless entities is
mandatory, providing preliminary protection for WBAN
interactions (Shen et al. 2016; He et al. 2017). There-
fore, various charts and unknown security threats such
as eavesdropping, impersonation, message replaying can
be prevented (Liu et al. 2020). After mutual authenti-
cation, efficient group key distribution and management
of all verified wearable sensors is of great significance
(Anjum et al. 2020). Therefore, subsequent private bio-
metric data can be safely transmitted. Message broad-
casting between all legal sensors can also be realized
(Liu et al. 2014).

In this paper, we develop a pairing-free authen-
tication and sensor cooperation scheme in cloud-
assisted WBANSs, where major security requirements for
WBAN sensors could be satisfied. Our design guar-
antee the sensor anonymity in the whole transmission
session. Note that our design offers pairing-free val-
idation procedure followed with active sensor coop-
eration, which is suitable for massive sensor scenar-
ios. The security analysis proves that our designed

scheme is capable of achieving desired security properties
and offer adequate resistances to the charted malicious
attacks. Meanwhile, security comparison demonstrates
that the proposed protocol is superior to other existing
schemes.

Related work

Recently, many research papers have been published,
which focus on secure data transmission for WBANSs.
Firstly, the traditional public key cryptography (TPKC)
techniques has been utilized to the wireless mobile envi-
ronment (Horn and Preneel 1998; Shen et al. 2017; Zhang
et al. 2020). However, relatively large computation cost
is made, which is not practical for resource-constrained
sensors. Thereafter, many schemes with elliptic curve
cryptography (ECC) have been presented (Zhang et al.
2013).

Meanwhile, several identification and key agreement
mechanisms have been proposed in (Yang and Chang
2009; Wang 2015), which all adopt the identity-based key
cryptography (ID-PKC). In ID-PKC, the key generation
center (KGC) is responsible for generating public keys,
which could drastically decrease the computation cost for
encrypting and decrypting procedure.

However, ID-PKC schemes is vulnerable to key escrow
problem. Hence, certificateless public key cryptography
(CL-PKC) is proposed (Al-Riyami and Paterson 2003).
So far many certificateless authentication schemes have
been proposed. Xiong (2014) proved that protocols of
(Liu et al. 2014) cannot provide scalability and forward
security. Liu et al. (2014) designed the enhanced CL-
PKC protocol for WBAN scenarios. Meanwhile, the cer-
tificateless encrypting and signing mechanism is devel-
oped in (Xiong and Qin 2015). The efficient and scal-
able identity revocation mechanism is adopted. Li et al.
(Li and Hong 2016) designed an efficient certificateless
signcryption scheme with the corresponding access con-
trol method. Thereafter, ciphertext- policy attribute-based
encryption is deployed (Hu et al. 2016). Focusing on
preserving the user real identity, another anonymous-
identity authenticating scheme is presented (He et al.
2017), which overcomes the security vulnerability in
(Liu et al. 2014). In 2018, Ji et al. presented an cer-
tificateless conditional privacy-preserving authentication
(CPPA) scheme for WBAN (ji et al. 2018). The pro-
posed method offers batch authentication towards mas-
sive number of participant users, which could signif-
icantly reduce the computational cost of the WBAN
service provider (SP). Currently, several novel WBAN
authentication mechanisms are proposed (Li et al. 2018).
Thereafter, X. Li and L. Wang (Li and Wang 2012)
proposed a fast certificateless authentication scheme
employing bilinear pairing in wireless communication
scenarios.

Model definition and preliminaries

In this section, the related preliminaries are introduced.
Thereafter, the corresponding notations, and system
model are illustrated as follows.

Elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC)

We define p > 3 as a large prime, F,, be the finite field
of order p, where a,b € F,, could satisfy 4a° + 27b?
(mod p) # 0. The elliptic curve E, (a, b) on a finite field
IF’, is defined as follows

y =x? +ax+b mod p,

where (x,y) € Fy. As for E, (a,b), the addition opera-
tion on this curve is defined as point doubling when the
two points are identical. Otherwise, it is defined as point
addition. All the points on the curve E, (a,b), and the
point at the infinity oo could form an additive Abelian
group E (F,). In this way 00 = (—00) acts as the identity
element.

Bilinear pairing

We define G, as a cyclic additive group generated by the
large prime number q, and G2 as the cyclic multiplicative
group with the same prime order. A mapping function e :
G, x G,; — Gp is constructed as the bilinear pairing if and
only if the following three properties could be satisfied all:

1 Bilinearity: VP, Q,R € G, and Va, b € Zz, there is

é(P,Q+R) =e(Q+R,P) = e(P, Q)e (PR)

2 Non-degeneracy: SP, Q € G; such that
é (P,Q) # 1g,, where 1g, is defined as the identity
element of Go.

3 Computability: VP, Q € Gj, there exists an efficient
algorithm to compute é (P, Q).

é (aP, bQ) = é(P, bQ)* = é(aP, Q)” =e (P,Q)”

In this way, the bilinear map é that satisfies the above
three properties can be constructed with the modified
Weil pairing or Tate pairing under the supersingular ellip-
tic curve G,. The following related characteristics are
presented.

Computational diffie-Hellman problem (CDHP)

We define P,aP,bP € G, for a,b € Li where P is
the generator of G,, the advantage for any probabilistic
polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm A in computing abP so
as to solve the CDHP problem is negligible, which can be
defined as:

AdvQel? = Pr|.A(P,aP, bP) > abP : a,b € Z|.
Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)

Given P,Q € Gj, where Q = abP. In order to solve
the ECDLP problem, the advantage for any probabilistic

Page 3 of 9

polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm A in finding the integer
a € Z, can be defined as:

Advice” = Pr [A (P,aP) > a:ae Zi

Hash function
The one-way hash function is defined to be secure if the
following three properties can be satisfied:

1 If input a message x which is of arbitrary length, it is
computationally easy to compute a message digest of
the fixed length output /(~).

2 With y, it is difficult to compute x = h71(y).

3 With x, it is computationally infeasible to get x’ 4 x
such that h(x’) = h(x) holds.

Notations
The notations used in our design are briefly introduced in
Table 1.

System model

The structure of our cloud-assisted WBANs is shown in
Fig. 1, where the whole WBAN system consists of three
essential entities: the cloud-based healthcare center (HC),
the personal controller (PCs) and the medical sensors.
Note that the HC consists of medical database, cen-
tral authority (CA), and law enforcement agency (LEA).
Description of these entities are respectively illustrated

Healthcare center (HC)

HC is mainly composed of the central authority (CA), the
medical database, and the law enforcement agency (LEA).
Each of the entities play different roles. CA is responsi-
ble for processing the vital system operations, including
patient registration and secret key generation. The sig-
nificant user personal information, such as identity num-
ber and the private password, are stored in the medical
database. It is worth noting that the remote cloud server
could provide adequate storage for database. CA is infeasi-
ble to be compromised by the adversaries. The remaining
LEA is for the illegal behavior management, which is usu-
ally performed as the government department. All the
sensor revocation and registration process by CA should
be fully acknowledged to the LEA department. The three
entities: LEA, CA, and database together, are considered
as the cloud-assited HC. Typically, HC is defined as a med-
ical service provider and a trusted key management center.
The important personal data will be transmitted to HC,
which could reflect the patient’s real-time physical con-
dition. Therefore, the corresponding medication for the
specific patient is available.

Personal controllers (PCs)

In general, personal controllers (PCs) are defined as spe-
cialized medical equipment with specific medical pur-
poses. It is assumed that the PC is a portable device with
a function of collecting and communicating biometric
information with HC. In other words, the importan phys-
iological data collected from several WBANs sensors will
be delivered to the personal controller. Note that each user
of WBAN is connected with a specific personal controller.

Sensors

The sensor is assumed to be implanted or attached to
the user’s body as a wireless biomedical device. Sensors
have limited computational power and battery capacity.

The sensor is responsible for real-time measurement of
various physiological indicators of specific user. Typically,
multiple sensors, each responsible for monitoring differ-
ent biometrics, are effective within the human body range.
All important personal data collected is transferred to the
PC via an open wireless connection. Note that all physio-
logical sensor data collected are time-related parameters.

Proposed authentication and key distribution
scheme

In this section, we describe the proposed practical authen-
tication and key distribution scheme in cloud-assisted
WBANSs. The proposed scheme consists of two subsec-
tions: PC-to-sensor mutual authentication, and group
key generation between sensors, which will be described
respectively.

PC-to-Sensor mutual authentication

Our design on PC-to-sensor authentication does not need
the secure transmission channels for crucial key extrac-
tion. As a matter of fact, the constant device identity
and private password are the only two required parame-
ters. The security assurance of our mechanism is based
on the hardness of the previously introduced CDH prob-
lem, which has been briefly introduced in the previous
section. The authenticating process of our design is shown
in Fig. 2.

Firstly, in our design, each medical sensor should regis-
ter to the LEA initially before use. Each sensor is assigned
the unique identity number, which is defined as the static
parameter representing the original identity of certain
sensor. It is worth noting that the allocated identity will
be kept unchanged since the beginning. Meanwhile, the
confidential password for each sensor will be randomly
generated by the WBAN managing system. In this way, the
identity number, and the confidential password for each
sesnor i, which are respectively denoted as A; and k;, are

stored in the cloud medical database, where only CA and
LEA have access to.

We define Gy, as the cyclic additive group which is
generated by the generator P with an order g. CA then
chooses the system master key s randomly and then com-
putes the system public key P,,,» in the way of

Poub = SP. (1)

The secure hash functions used in our method Hj, Ho
and H3 are respectively defined as follows:

Ay : {0, 1}* —> Lit,
A: {0,1}* x Gy > Zp. (2)
3 : {0,1}* x Gy > Z,

where Z*, is defined as the nonnegative integer set less
than the predefined large prime number P.

It is worth noting that the generator P, the public key
Pyup, the three one-way hash function H), H2, and Hs3,
as well as Gz, will all be published to the nearby WBAN
devices, while the system master key s is kept secret
during the whole session. The detailed steps for WBAN
authentication are as follows:

First, each sensor i random generates &; as the original
key seed. Hence, sensor will compute 7; according to

Ri = &P. (3)

Thereafter, the parameter vj is calculated, which combines
the original identity number A; and the generated ran-
dom number é;. Note that the value of A; remain constant.
Hence, the random value &; could help improve the resis-
tance to several malicious attacks. The v; is calculated as

vj = Hy(A;) + &. (4)

For different authentication session, the v; is dynamic in
this case. Also, it is worth emphasizing that CA will not
reveal the identity number A; of individual i to any user
(PC). In this way, the real identity of sensor is beyond
PC’s reach. Thus, under extreme occasions with colli-
sion by malicious PC, the adversaries cannot retrieve the
confidential message by tracing the unique identity of
particular sensor. Moreover, instead of using the private

Page 5 of 9

secret key totally from the PC, the generated &; is consid-
ered as the partial private key and safely stored in sensor
side.

Subsequently, the corresponding ¢; is generated by sen-
sor i as follows:

bi = Ay(Aj, Ri, ki), (5)

where the sensor i adopts its previous generated password
k;. Vehicle i then gathers (7e;, v;, ¢;) and forwards it to PC.

As mentioned above, our method assign the heavy com-
putation and storage task to the remote cloud server
(medical database and CA). In this way, the portable PCs
does not need to process the heavy tasks. Instead, PCs per-
form as the forwarding channel between massive sensors
and cloud CA. It means a lot for practical consideration
since the computation and storage of each PC are related
restricted compared to the cloud server.

Moreover, in our system model we consider the PCs
as the benign entities in most of the time. As mentioned
above, in certain cases the PCs may be compromised or
disabled physically. Hence in our assumption the PCs do
not need to act as the vital key generation and verification
center. In fact, in our design, upon receiving the message
(Ri, vi, i) from sensor i, PC is designed to directly for-
ward the acquired medical data to the cloud-based CA,
which is responsible for partial secret key distribution and
identification.

As illustrated previously, the sensor i’s identity number
A; and the corresponding password x; are stored in cloud
medical database. Initially, the value of H,(A;) for all the
sensors are also calculated and stored in database. In this
case, upon receiving the request, CA computes

TD; = u;P (6)
using the received v;. Then CA first add 7; to all the
stored H(A;) as follows

Aj = Hy(Aj) + &. (7)

In this way, CA compares the computed Aj; with the
received v; and finally searches the JA; of the request-
ing sensor from remote database. Then CA checks the
correctness of

P= My (Ai)P + Ri. (8)
The correctness is elaborated as follows:
TP; = vjP
= (fH, (A;) + &) P
= Hy(Aj)P + &P
= M(Ai)P + Ri

(9)

If the above I; is validated, CA will also check the cor-
rectness of the received ¢; by combing the stored sensor
information (Aj, «;) with the received R;.
Song and Tan Cybersecurity (2020) 3:21

In practical application scenario with 1 assumed sen-
sors, the verifying process in CA side is similar to the
above single sensor situation. CA will then check the
correctness as

YTS Mi(ADP + YY Ri. (10)
That is,
yo i= > we
— » (Hy (Aj) + &) P | an
= SOM (AdP +> &P
=~ (ADP + Ri

In the occasions where both v; and ¢; are proved to be
correct, CA is then capable of deriving &; by

&; = uj — Hi (Ai), (12)

where &; is stored in the medical database. The database

processing is briefly shown in Fig. 3. Note that &; is shared

between CA and sensor i, while PC has zero knowledge
about it.

In the next, CA generates random value k; for each sen-

sor i. The value of W; and y; are calculated in the way of

Wi = kK{Ri = ki&iP (13)

Vi = F3(Ai kin Wi &i)8 + Ki

Note that (Ri; Wi; yi) will be broadcast to sensor i through

PC. Sensor derives the assigned key PSK; by
PSK; = EW = KP. (14)

The validity of the received information will also be
checked by sensor i:

?
yiP = H3(Aj, Kis Wi, €i) Pub + PSKi. (15)

 

 

 

Fig. 3 Cloud Medical Database

Page 6 of 9

That is,
yiP —= F3 (Ai, Ki» Wi; &;)sP + k;P (16)
= A3(Aj, Kis Wis €i) Poup + PSKi

As for multiple sensors, the following batch checking
process can be done:

n n n
» yiP = » F3(Aj, Ki, Wis €i)sP + » kiP
n n °
= SF AB Ab kis Wi i) Ppus +), PK
In this way, the sensor and CA are mutually authen-
ticated. As for PC, necessary information are allocated

by remote CA to help build the secure data transmission
channel. Thus CA computes

Wj = sKiRi = Eiki Pou
Yi = kiPoub = kjsP

and send to PC.
At this point, the sensitive medical data M; from sensor
iis delivered as

(Ri; IS, Encp,(W;) [ Mi, TS] » H3(Mi, IS, Ri; ui) kiP) . (19)

The related verification can be done by PC as

(17)

(18)

» [H3(Mi, TS, Ri, vi)K:P] s = » H3(Mj, TS, Ri, vi) Ti
(20)
The batch verification process is as follow:
Y-, Aa(My, TS, Ri, vi) KP] s =) H3(Mi, TS, Ri, vi)kisP
= S7 A3(Mi, TS, Ri, vi) Kis?

= » A3 (Mi, TS, Ri vi) Ti
(21)

Sensor revocation

If expired or illegal sensors detected, the relevant
acknowledgment message should be sent to the law
enforcement agency. After approval, the PC will revoke
the sensors by deleting the stored WY; and Yj; from its
storage. The revocation can be done in this way.

Sensor group key distribution
In this subsection the sensor group key distribution
scheme is presented, where all the participating sensors
will cooperate with each other as shown in Fig. 4. The
detailed steps are presented as follows:

We assume there are 1 legitimate sensor in PC’s effec-
tive range. At first, all the sensors (i €[1,”]) randomly
generates its own y; and computes

Wi = ViPoub-
Zi = Ay (Vi Ki)

Then (z;, W;, H(W;))((i €[ 1, ”]) is broadcast to all. All the
n sensors can be informed of the rest 1 — 1 messages.

According to the value of z;, the sensor i could sort the
received message. Then the sequence of

(Z1 5 +00) Zi—1s Zin Zi4- 1s +09 Zn) + (23)

is generated. Each sensor listed in this sequence computes

F; = yiQWj-1 — Wi41)s (24)

where W,_; and Wj+1 refers to the values from sensor
i’s neighbors, that is, sensor i — 1 and sensor i + 1. In
this way, all the 7 sensors acquire F; and then broadcast
(I, F;, H2 (1, F;)) to all, where I is the sequence number of
sensors in (2, ..., Zj—-1) Zi) Zit-1) +» Zn) (1 €[ 1, ]) The sensor
cooperation procedure is shown in Fig. 5.

In this way, each sensor could finally received n — 1
requests. After checking the validity of the hashed value
H(I, Fj), sensor i will combine all the values together in
the way as follows

Y=F, + 2Fo+4,..., tiFj4+,..., +nF, + H30M, ..., Wy)P

where J is defined as the intermediate key. In this way,
all the sensors acquire the same J. As we previous intro-
duced, PC randomly choose @ and delivered wPy,, to all
the sensors i first. Hence the final group key K is achieved
by combing with wP generated by PC. That is,

Security analysis

In this section, we briefly describe the security properties
of the proposed authentication scheme.

Certificateless authentication

As illustrated above, certificateless key distribution design
is adopted in our scheme. That is, the CA only gener-
ates part of the secret for each sensors. Hence the key
escrow problem can be addressed. That is, during the

authentication phase, both HC and PC have zero knowl-
edge on the self-generated random partial secret key in
the sensor side. In this way, impersonation attack on spe-
cific sensor cannot pass the validation. The generated key
is not revealed to PC during the whole process. Hence,
the compromising of PC will not brings negative effect to
the whole WBAN system. In this way, the certificateless
authentication property is provided.

Mutual authentication

Our scheme deploys the proper authenticating strategies,
which is able to provide mutual authentication property
between the remote CA and sensors. Note that only two
communication rounds are required during our mutual
authentication process. Moreover, the batch authentica-
tion on multiple sensors is also available, which provides
new prospect for practical implementation of WBANSs.

Sensor anonymity & conditional privacy

In our design, instead of using the device’s real identity, we
apply the self-generated anonymous identity, which also
combines the stored static identity information A;. Hence
illegal tracing towards certain sensor can be prevented.
Moreover, the real identity of the sensor can be revealed if
abnormal behavior is detected under extreme situations.
Hence the accountability is presented.

Resistance to mITM attack

In the proposed scheme, the hash function is utilized
in the whole authentication session with the purpose
of resisting the Man-In-The-Middle attack. The MITM
attack is conducted by modifying the legitimate messages
without being detected. In our design, the receiver side
will check the validity upon receiving every message. With
the adopted hash function for message confidentiality
preservation, the MITM attack can be prevented.

Resistance to replay attack

As mentioned above, the pseudo-random value genera-
tor is adopted in both HC and sensor side, which could
guarantee the resistance to replay attack. In this way,
the reusing on the previously acquired information can
not pass the current authentication session. On the other
hand, each transmitted packet set contain obvious time-

related information (time-stamp) revealing precise time
sequence.

Cooperative sensor key establishment

In our scheme, the sensors group key is cooperatively gen-
erated by all the participating sensors. Note that neither
CA nor PC has full control of the group key generation.

Comparison on security properties

In this section, we present the comparison in terms of
the crucial security properties for WBANs authentication
scenarios. Our WBAN authentication design is compared
with the state-of-the-art WBAN authentication and key
agreement schemes including MLAP (Shen et al. 2018),
ATCC (Jiang et al. 2017), and HAKE (Drira et al. 2012)
with the aim of demonstrating its superiority on security.
The security comparison results are presented in Table 2,
showing that the proposed scheme could satisfy all the
desired security requirements.

Conclusion
In this paper, an efficient cloud-assisted pairing-free
grouping authentication scheme in _ cloud-assisted

WBANs is presented. In our design, the sensor anonymity
is provided during the whole communication. Moreover,
the cooperative sensor association mechanism is given,
where the sensor group key is generated by the inter-
communication between the legitimate participating
WBAN sensors. The proposed scheme could satisfy
desired security properties and provide resistance to
major security attacks.
