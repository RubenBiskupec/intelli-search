Abstract

Environmental considerations have prompted the use of renewable energy resources worldwide for reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions. An accurate prediction of wind speed plays a major role in environmental planning,
energy system balancing, wind farm operation and control, power system planning, scheduling, storage capacity
optimization, and enhancing system reliability. This paper proposes an accurate prediction of wind speed based
ona Recursive Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RRBFNN) possessing the three inputs of wind direction,
temperature and wind speed to improve modern power system protection, control and management. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed model improves the wind speed prediction accuracy with least error when

compared with other existing prediction models.

1 Introduction

Environmental degradation and depletion of conventional
energy have helped direct attention towards wind energy.
The dual aims of global reduction of CO, emissions and
improving energy security (being the energy policy goal in
many countries) coincide with the increasing use of wind
energy for electricity generation. Wind speed prediction is
a noted problem and hot topic in research due to the time
varying and volatile nature of wind.

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a nonlinear in-
formation processing system, inspired by the biological
nervous system [1] and constructed based on intercon-
nected elementary processing devices called neurons. The
ANN is widely used for various applications because of
certain special features such as its good self learning
ability, adaptability, real-time operation, fault tolerance,
simple implementation and cost effectiveness. ANNs can
be classified as feed-forward and feedback (recurrent) net-
works. A network arranged in layers with no feedback

path is called a feed-forward network, e.g., Back propaga-
tion network, Multi-layer perceptron, Radial basis func-
tion network, etc. [1]. A network with a feedback path
that occurs between the layers (or) within the layers is
called feedback network, e.g., ELMAN, Hopfield, Boltz-
mann machine, etc. The Radial basis function network is a
multi-layer feed-forward network and is generally applied
for pattern recognition and function approximation appli-
cations. The network arrangment is from the input layer,
through one (or) more hidden layers, to the output layer.
Small variations of wind speed can lead to significant
change to the operation of wind driving systems, and hence,
wind speed prediction is required for the following reasons:

1) To aid planning and control of a power system and
wind farm.

2) Effective integration of wind power to the electrical
power grid.

3) Reliable and high quality operation of the power
system.

4) To meet the requirement of a system with low
spinning reserve.

5) To minimize the operating cost of wind power
generation.

Much research has attempted and proposed ANN-
based wind speed prediction models, and a review of
relevant work is given below.

Anurag More et al. [2], proposed cascade correlation
and back propagation algorithms-based neural networks
for short-term wind speed prediction. Results reveal that
the approach achieves 4.7% of MSE for cascade correl-
ation and 4.5% of MSE for back propagation. Perez Li era
et al. [3], develop a wind speed prediction model based on
a BP (Back Propagation) algorithm, and achieve 0.00056
of MSE for 20 mins ahead wind speed prediction.

Selcuk Nogay H et al. [4], analyze various ANN-based
models for short-term wind speed forecasting. Results
suggest that the proposed model with 60 neurons
achieves successful forecasting with 0.378088 of MSE
and 0.970490 of approximation values. Vigneswaran T
and Dhivya S [5], investigate and predict the wind speed
for 18h ahead of time scale by means of five ANN tech-
niques, namely FFBP, CFBP, GRNN, PNN, and KNN.
Among the five, GRNN is found to be superior and opti-
mal due to the lowest MSE (2.8568%).

Chuanan Yao et al. [6], present a comparison of three
wavelet neural networks for short-term wind speed fore-
casting. The first two models are based on combinations
of wavelet transform and neural network, namely Com-
pact Wavelet Neural Network (CWNN) and Loose Wave-
let Neural Network (LWNN), while the third model is a
hybrid method based on the CWNN and LWNN model.
Forecasting performance proves that the third model is
more accurate than the other two despite the drawback of
lower computational efficiency. The MAE, RMSE and
MAPE values of the LCWNN model are 0.426 m/s, 0.468
m/s, and 11.82%, respectively. Gnana Sheela K and Deepa
S N [7], use a radial basis function network-based wind
speed prediction and introduce a new algorithm to search
the proper hidden neurons. The suggested 101 various cri-
teria are validated based on the error values of MSE,
MAE, and MAPE, and the minimal error value is consid-
ered as the best solution among the 101 criteria (ite. MSE
of 2.5e-08, MAPE of 3.65e-04 and MAE of 1.97e-05).
Ramesh Babu N and Arulmozhivarman P [8], use a hybrid
method composed of Wavelet Transform and Neural Net-
work (WTNN). WT is used to decompose the time series
data in the different consecutive data series, and the data
is given to the Neural Network (NN) to forecast future
wind speed. The MSE, RMSE and mean average error are
reduced by 7.38%, 12.7%, and 8.91% respectively com-
pared with BPNN. Xinrong Liu et al. [9], develop Rele-
vance Vector Machine (RVM) and Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD) based models. EMD decomposes
complex nonlinear and non-stationary signals into some

stable layers and is an effective method for analyzing wind
speed. A Bayesian estimation theory-based RVM model is
superior to SVM in terms of reduced computational com-
plexity. The results confirm that the EMD—RVM-based
model obtains 11.18 of MAPE, and is better than RVM.
Qinghua Hu et al. [10], propose a pattern-based ap-
proach for short-term prediction and in order to per-
form better than the clustering based approach. The
Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA)
method is adopted to find the hidden sub spaces and
their dimensions. An ensemble prediction method with
time scales from 1 to 24h ahead prediction outperforms
other methods, and the proposed Ensemble GPCA
achieves 5.3305 of MSE. Ramesh Babu N and Arulmoz-
hivarman P [11], develop a very short-term forecasting
model based on Nonlinear Auto regression with exogen-
ous input (NARX), and achieves 0.2008 and 0.4481 of
MSE and RMSE, respectively. Wenyu Zhang et al. [12],
work on a hybrid forecasting model based on SSA and
intelligent optimized algorithms. This method consists
of decomposition and reconstruction of SSA and hence
results in better evaluation of forecasting performance in
a time series. SVM is found to be unsatisfactory, but two
other forecasting methods (ANN, ARIMA) are still suit-
able for short-term prediction of wind speed (4—7 h).
Madhiarasan M and Deepa S N [13], develop 151 differ-
ent criteria for the proper selection of hidden neurons in
Improved Back Propagation Networks (IBPN) for wind
speed forecasting. The results showed that the criterion
(8n-4)/ (n-4) with 36 hidden neurons achieves better MSE
of 5.8672e-08, MAE of 4.0908e-05, MRE of 1.1919e-05
and RMSE of 2.4222e-04 than other proposed criteria.
Hence, the suggested novel criterion improves forecasting
accuracy. Other related work on developing wind speed
forecasting models has also been reported in [14—22].
Dehua Zheng et al. [23], considered double stage hier-
archical ANFIS-based wind power forecasting for the short
term horizon for micro grid energy management. A limita-
tion is that the forecasting error is high. Hao Chen et al.
[24], performed wind power forecasting based on GARCH
type models, and the limitation accuracy was improved.
From the above review and as illustrated in [25], it is
clear that various heuristics exist. Further research is never-
theless still required. Based on the existing approaches, it is
clear that generalized and highly accurate wind speed pre-
diction is still challenging. Some forecasting models obtain
better results only for the considered forecast horizon but
fail to generalize for other horizons. This paper proposes
an accurate wind speed prediction model based on a Re-
cursive Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RRBFNN).
The main aim is to achieve better prediction accuracy, with
reduced minimal error, than other existing methods.
Enhanced prediction accuracy with small evaluation
metrics is advantageous. The main novelty of the paper
Madhiarasan Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems

is the proposal of a novel RRBFNN for the prediction of
wind speed. Compared to the radial basis function neural
network, the proposed RRBFNN adopts a different recur-
sive learning algorithm. Hence, errors are minimized fur-
ther leading to optimal forecasting performance. The
main advantages are the provision of highly accurate pre-
diction of wind speed with minimal training computa-
tional time when compared to other typical methods, and
being generic for various forecasting horizons such as very
short, short, medium and long term.

2 Proposed recursive radial basis function neural
networks
2.1 Problem description
In order to achieve better generalization for wind speed
prediction, the input and output are to be modeled and
the hidden neuron number should be appropriately se-
lected for the neural network design. In the current
scenario many prediction research fields have been heur-
istic. While numerous researchers have developed pre-
diction models for accurate wind speed prediction, no
perfect model has been achieved. However, an accurate
wind speed prediction model based on RRBFNN for a
long-term forecast horizon (1 day to 1 week ahead or
more) is presented in this paper.

The proposed system is selected for the following
reasons:

(i) Ability to overcome the local minima.

(ii) Resilient against a poor training set.

(iii) Fast training.

(iv) Improvement of convergence speed.

(v) Ease of implementation and compact structure.

2.2 Proposed system description

RRBFNN is a multi-layer feed-forward neural network
comprising an input layer, hidden layer and output layer.
In RRBFNN, weights are recursively updated to achieve
minimal output error. The proposed RRBFNN is super-
ior to back propagation feed-forward neural networks
and radial basis function networks in terms of conver-
gence and accuracy. The input layer outputs are ob-
tained by computing the distance between the inputs
and hidden layer centers, and are transferred to the hid-
den layer in a nonlinear form. The hidden layer has a
large dimension because all the input layer neurons are
connected directly to it, and each hidden neuron in the
hidden layer has parameters such as width and center
position. Each hidden neuron in the hidden layer has an
activation function, and generally a Gaussian activation
function is applied to RRBFNN. The adjustment of the
network limits such as spread value helps to fine tune
the Gaussian recursive radial basis function. The outputs
of the hidden layer are a weighted form of the input

(2020) 5:22

layer outputs and are transferred to the output layer in a
linear form. The weights are updated recursively in
order to obtain the minimum output error, and the
weight updating process uses the gradient descent rule.

Neural Networks with many hidden layers cause the
following problems:

(i) Increased complexity of the network.
(ii) Extremely hard to train based on the weight values.
(iii) Increased computational time.
(iv) Possibility of encountering the over-fitting problem.
Hence, the presence of several hidden layers leads to un-
satisfactory and poor performance. Therefore, the proposed
RRBFNN only has one hidden layer, which is sufficient to
approach any continuous function with the least complexity
and improved output performance. A single hidden layer
with various hidden neurons is employed for performance
analysis of the proposed model.

2.3 Proposed wind speed prediction model
The proposed RRBFNN based wind speed prediction
model has inputs of Wind direction (WD,,), Temperature
(TD,,) and Wind speed (N,,), and the input layer is con-
structed based on the three input neurons. The output
layer has a single output neuron, ie., the predicted wind
speed. The architecture of the proposed RRBFNN model
is shown in Fig. 1, and the inferred input and output target
vector pairs are described in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1,
each layer performs independent computation on the re-
ceived data and the computed results are passed to the
next layer and finally the network output is determined.
According to Fig. 1, the input and output vectors are
given as

X =[WDy, TD, Ny] (1)
Y = [Npw] (2)

The weight vectors between the hidden to output vec-
tors are

W = [Wy Wo, .., Win] (3)

and the Gaussian activation function can be expressed
as

f (Yin) = eb %") (4)

where Y;,, is the net output of RRBFNN and can be given
as

2.3.1 Data collection

Real-time data was collected from the Suzlon Energy
Private Limited from January 2016 to December 2018.
Wind direction (Degree), Temperature (°C) and Wind
speed (m/s) are the inputs to the proposed RRBFNN and
network output is the predicted wind speed (m/s). The
proposed RRBFNN model is designed using 10,000 sets
of data. Table 2 shows the used input parameters of the
RRBFNN model, and Table 3 shows the collected real-
time input data sample.

2.3.2 Data normalization

Normalization (or scaling) is mandatory for dealing with
real-time data having different ranges and units. There-
fore, normalization is used to scale the real-time data
within the range of 0 to 1 to help achieve more accurate

the minimum and maximum target values, respectively.

2.3.3 Proposed neural network design

The proposed RRBFNN design parameters include the
dimensions and epochs as shown in Table 4. The pre-
sented neural network design has three input neurons
(wind direction, temperature and wind speed), one hid-
den layer with varying hidden neurons between 1 to 50,
and one output neuron (predicted wind speed).

The input layer and hidden layer are interconnected
by means of a hypothetical connection. The hidden layer
has a Gaussian function, and the hidden layer and out-
put layer are interconnected by means of the weighted
connections. The output layer has a linear function. The
weights are updated recursively to the RRBFNN to

Training learns from the normalized data and the test
for the stopping condition is the error reaching a negli-
gible value.

2.3.4 Training and testing of the proposed neural network
A wind speed prediction model is developed based on
the training data while the performance of the pro-
posed model is evaluated using the testing data. The
collected 10,000 real-time data is classified into train-
ing and testing sets, with 70% of the collected data
(7,000) used for the training phase and the remaining
30% (3,000) for the testing phase of the neural net-
work. Network performance is computed by means of
statistical error criteria.

2.3.5 Sensible variation of the system

Proper selection of hidden neurons in neural networks
plays a major role in improving the quality and perform-
ance of the network. The performance of the proposed
RRBFNN-based prediction model is analyzed with vari-
ous hidden neurons between 1 to 50 by fixing all the
other design parameters. The appropriate numbers of
hidden neurons in the hidden layer are determined
based on the minimal statistical errors.

4 Experimental results and discussion

The proposed RRBFNN is run on an Acer laptop
computer with Pentium (R) Dual Core processor run-
ning at 2.30GHZ with 2GB of RAM. The real-time
data is initially classified into training and testing sets.
The training set is used in neural network learning
and the testing set is used to compute the errors.

measured values. Based on the proposed wind speed pre-
diction model, the comparison between 3000 samples of
actual and predicted wind speeds is shown in Fig. 2, where
some parts are zoomed for better clarity. The variations of
the prediction error with the numbers of data samples are
shown in Fig. 3. The effectiveness and generalization ability
of the proposed RRBFNN with 44 hidden neurons is ana-
lyzed based on different forecast horizons as shown in
Table 6. From Table 6, it can be seen that the proposed
model accurately predicts the wind speed for different hori-
zons. The proposed RRBFNN-based prediction model for
long-term forecast horizon with 44 hidden neurons has
lower minimal errors than other horizons. Compared to
other wind speed prediction models shown in Table 7, the
proposed model outperforms and achieves better minimal
statistical errors. The analysis on the training computation
time also reveals that the proposed RRBFNN requires less
time (ie. 72s) than that of other considered approaches.
Therefore, the proposed RRBFNN offers better forecasting
results as well performing better in terms of computation
time. Further comparison of the performance metrics
among the different wind speed prediction methods is
given in Fig. 4 and the demonstrated merits of the proposed
approach are (i) very effective minimum error and (ii) sim-
ple implementation.

5 Conclusion
A modern power system depends greatly on a renew-
able energy system in which a wind energy system is
one of the prominent renewable energy resources for
S m MSE fulfilling future power demand. The protection and
= m RMSE control of modern power system integration with a
m MAE wind energy system can be improved by precise wind
m MRE speed prediction. This paper proposes a novel Recur-
m MAPE sive Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RRBFNN)

 

Methods

real-time observations. Compared to other wind speed
prediction models, the proposed RRBFNN model with
44 hidden neurons achieves better accuracy with min-
imal statistical errors such as MSE of 1.6166e-12,
RMSE of 1.2715e-06, MAE of 8.2352e-07, MRE of
1.0165e-07 and MAPE of 1.0165e-05. The imple-
mented RRBFNN outperforms others for the long-
term forecast horizon with the least error, better sta-
bility and generalization ability and faster convergence
speed.
