Abstract

According to statistic data, machinery faults contribute to largest proportion of High-voltage circuit breaker failures,
and traditional maintenance methods exist some disadvantages for that issue. Therefore, based on the wavelet packet
decomposition approach and support vector machines, a new diagnosis model is proposed for such fault diagnoses
in this study. The vibration eigenvalue extraction is analyzed through wavelet packet decomposition, and a four-layer
Support vector machine is constituted as a fault classifier. The Gaussian radial basis function is employed as the kernel
function for the classifier. The penalty parameter c and kernel parameter 6 of the support vector machine are vital for
the diagnostic accuracy, and these parameters must be carefully predetermined. Thus, a particle swarm optimization-
Support vector machine model is developed in which the optimal parameters c and 6 for the support vector machine
in each layer are determined by the particle swarm algorithm. The validity of this fault diagnosis model is determined
with a real dataset from the operation experiment. Moreover, comparative investigations of fault diagnosis experi-
ments with a normal support vector machine and a particle swarm optimization back-propagation neural network

are also implemented. The results indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis model yields better accuracy and effi-

ciency than these other models.

1 Introduction

As a crucial protection and control apparatus in the
power grid, a high-voltage circuit breaker (HVCB)
is used to cut or connect the circuit according to the
received operating signal. HVCB faults caused by its
operating mechanism can lead to severe damage, such as
unscheduled time loss and even circuit destruction [1].
The reliability of HVCBs is closely linked to the stability
of the electrical supply provided by the power grid. The
maintenance of HVCBs is an important daily task for
substations. A traditional scheduled maintenance scheme
is widely applied for that purpose, in which the operat-
ing mechanism needs to be partially dissembled for

fault detection. Previous operating recordings indicate
that some unnecessary economic losses and new defect
mechanisms might be brought about by this scheduled
maintenance [2, 3]. Moreover, the relationship between
mechanical parameters and mechanical system health is
highly nonlinear. HVCB operating faults caused by inter-
nal operating mechanisms are very complicated to ana-
lytically formulate and detect by traditional maintenance
methods [4, 5]. Moreover, according to statistical data,
the operating mechanism contributes to a large portion
of HVCB operating failures. Operation rejection caused
by “mechanical stuck” (i.e., failing to open or close on
command) is responsible for the highest proportion of
major failures of HVCBs, at 34% of the overall failures [6].
Although typical on-line system monitors can improve
the reliability of the mechanism system, the feasibility of
these monitors is prevented by the high hardware cost

and construction difficulty [7, 8]. Thus, the diagnosis of
potential faults concealed inside operating mechanisms
is meaningful in enhancing the stability of the electrical
power supply to consumers.

With the advantages of strong self-adaptability, robust-
ness and great fault tolerance, artificial neural networks
(ANNs) can store large amounts of precise nonlinear
input-output mapping relationships through sufficient
training without revealing the mathematical equation [9].
Consequently, ANNs have recently become applied in
fault diagnoses [10, 11]. Based on an electric current sig-
nal, investigations of fault diagnosis of HVCB by ANNS
are popular recently [12-14], by which the card acerbity
and stroke over the iron core idle in HVCB has been diag-
nosed successfully. Fei et al. [15] noted that due to the
limitations of slow convergence velocity and easy relapse
into the local optimum, the performance of classic ANNs
needs to be further optimized. As an alternative solu-
tion, support vector machines (SVMs) successfully over-
come the disadvantages of ANNs. Moreover, combined
with other intelligent algorithms, SVMs can achieve fault
diagnoses with high accuracy with limited fault samples
[16]. For instance, an optimized genetic algorithm-based
SVM (GA-SVM) model was proposed [17, 18]. Through
this approach, operating mechanism faults, such as base
screw looseness and buffer spring failure, were suc-
cessfully diagnosed. Compared with the normal SVM
model, the optimized model achieved higher diagnostic
accuracy. An optimized maintenance scheme based on
least-squares SVM was also proposed to predict the dis-
tribution of defects using statistical defect data collected
from large quantities of HVCBs [19]. The vibration signal
is highly related to the modal parameter of the mechani-
cal structure that directly contains more information
about the system health status of the operating mecha-
nism than electrical signal [20, 21]. Besides, based on
variable feature extraction and analysis method [22, 23],
vibration signal has been successfully be utilized in fault
diagnosis of rotating machinery like gearbox [24] and
combustion engines [25]. These valuable studies provide
some guidance for fault diagnosis of switching mecha-
nism like high voltage circuit breakers. One of the key
points of fault diagnosis is the eigenvalue extraction of
the fault signal. Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD)
can achieve multi-scale information refinement by scal-
ing and moving its operation function. Therefore, the
fault eigenvalue in vibration can be effectively extracted
through WPD to form an input vector for the fault diag-
nosis model [26, 27].

The abovementioned studies have successfully diag-
nosed some faults caused by the buffer spring, electro-
magnet and base screw of HVCBs. For an electromagnet,
its iron core might be stuck without effective lubrication,

Page 2 of 10

which eventually causes the action rejection fault of a
HVCB. Faults caused by buffer spring deterioration and
base screw looseness can cause loud noises and abnormal
vibrations, which dramatically damage the operational
accuracy and reduce the service life of a high-voltage cir-
cuit breaker. All of these works are valuable in improving
the reliability of HVCBs and the overall electric power
system. However, as for the faults caused by some inter-
nal operating mechanisms components (e.g., cam, spring
and revolute joints), relative fault diagnosis works are still
absent due to the shortage of signal samples.

The purpose of this study is to propose a particle swarm
optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) fault
diagnosis model to diagnose these operating mecha-
nism faults. The Gaussian radial basis function is selected
as the kernel function of the SVM. The particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to determine the
kernel parameter and penalty parameter because they
are closely related to the accuracy of the fault diagnosis
model. Vibration signals generated during the operation
experiment are considered for fault diagnosis. A total of
150 groups of vibration signals under different operation
conditions are collected from HVCB experiments. These
vibration signals are analysed via WPD. Then, the energy
of each frequency band is extracted as the fault eigen-
value to form the input vector for the training and testing
of the proposed fault diagnosis model. In addition, com-
parative fault diagnosis experiments are performed with
the normal SVM model and a particle swarm optimiza-
tion-back-propagation neural network (PSO-BP) model.
The comparative study results suggest that the PSO-SVM
in the paper has better efficiency and higher diagno-
sis accuracy than the other models; thus, the PSO-SVM
model can overcome the limitations of traditional main-
tenance and eventually improve the reliability of HVCBs.

2 Signal Eigenvalue Extraction
2.1 Description of the Operation Experiment
Compared with hydraulic and pneumatic operating
mechanisms, spring operating mechanisms are more
compact and lower cost, and they do not leak oil or gas.
Thus, spring operating mechanisms have been widely
applied in HVCBs at voltage levels between 10 and 35 kV.
ZN12 is a common new kind of indoor three-phase
HVCB equipped with a spring operating mechanism.
According to a previous operating report, a large number
of operating mechanism faults appear during the service
period. Figure 1 shows the main structure and two typical
operating mechanism faults, over-travel and mechanical
stuck, in ZN12 and the vibration signal collection system
in this paper.

The over-travel fault of the mechanical system is quite
common in the service period of an HVCB. Once an

over-travel fault occurs, the HVCB cannot be resettled
for the opening operation to cut the fault circuit in the
power grid. In addition, mechanical stuck faults generally
exist in the revolute joints of an articulated mechanism.
Under normal conditions, there is reasonable clearance
and good lubrication in revolute joints that ensures the
mobility of the mechanism system. However, in the long-
term service process, the lubrication might deteriorate.
In addition, the clearance size of revolute joints could
also change along with the inevitable wear effects during
operation. All these factors can lead to mechanical stuck
faults. Operating mechanism faults in spring operating
mechanisms are highly nonlinear and hard to detect by
scheduled maintenance schemes.

Fault signal samples are indispensable for model train-
ing to establish an intelligent diagnosis model. However,
traditional big data of HVCBs from the power grid are
characterized by a low density of valuable signal data, and
most of the recordings are normal signal samples. It is
difficult to determine a sufficient number of fault signals
to train and establish a fault diagnosis model. The fault
signals adopted in previous studies of HVCB fault diag-
nosis are insufficient and are scarcely involved the faults
caused by the internal operating mechanisms. Thus, an
indoor operation experiment is first conducted in this
study. By deteriorating the lubrication and components
of the mechanism, normal conditions and four types of
operating mechanism fault conditions (cam offset, spring

creep, over-travel and mechanical stuck) are constituted.
The operation of an HVCB belongs to a transient shock
process (spring energy releases instantaneously, and then
the cam impacts the roller to drive the whole operat-
ing mechanism). For accurate vibration measurements,
accelerometer performance should be selected based on
the maximum vibration burst that can be expected for
the mechanism.

A set of vibration collection system from Britel&Kjzr
is adopted in this paper. The system mainly includes a
CCLD/IEPE accelerometer type 8339 (a measuring range
of + 20000g (g=9.8 m/s”), a sensitivity of 0.25 mV/g, an
upper-frequency limit of 20 kHz, and a non-linearity of
0.3%), and a vibration recorder type 3053 (a 25.6 kHz
sampling frequency for a time period of 100 ms per
operation process). In this paper, the vibration signals of
a high-voltage circuit breaker type ZN12 are collected
under five different operation conditions (normal condi-
tion, cam offset, spring creep, over-travel, and mechani-
cal stuck). Thirty groups of vibration signals are collected
per operation condition; hence, a total of 150 recordings
are collected.

2.2 Wavelet Packet Decomposition

Compared with the traditional fast Fourier transform,
WPD belongs to a self-adaptive and multi-scale signal
processing method whose sampling window size var-
ies with respect to the signal frequency. Therefore, both
Li et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:6

good time resolution at the high-frequency band and
good frequency resolution at the low-frequency band
can be achieved by WPD [27]. After decomposing the
vibration signal through WPD, the detailed signal in
different frequency bands can be obtained for further
Eigenvalue extraction. The basic theory of WPD is out-
lined as follows [28]:

Han x(0) = V2 Wk ue)

(1)
Unn_1,k(£) = V2 Vatu,

where k is the layer of decomposition; 4(k) and g(k) are
high-pass filters and low-pass filters, respectively; u(t) is
the original signal; and u(t) and uwpn_;(t) are the sig-
nals that passed the high and low filters, respectively.
The vibration signal is decomposed into two different
frequency subsections after each decomposition layer.
Then, the subsection is passed to the next layer and even-
tually forms a decomposition of a binary tree, as shown
in Figure 2.

The decomposition layer is vital for the signal resolu-
tion of the WPD method. Fewer decomposition layers
result in a dull reaction, especially with fewer distrib-
uted signal fluctuations. Meanwhile, an oversized
decomposition layer can exponentially increase the
computation and cause very large calculation errors.
Comprehensively, the WPD method with three decom-
position layers is used in this study. Figure 3 shows
one of the original vibration signals collected from the
operation experiment and its three-layer WPD result.

2.3 Vibration Energy Distribution

Figure 3 shows that the original vibration signal was
decomposed into eight frequency bands. There are
already some differences in each detail signal. In gen-
eral, the energy distribution of a vibration signal would
be altered in different frequency bands in the occur-
rence of a mechanical fault. Therefore, the energy of
each frequency band is selected as the signal eigenvalue
for fault diagnosis. The energy of each band is calcu-
lated and normalized as follows [17]:

denotes the signal energy extracted by the Hilbert tech-
nique [29].

As an instance, one vibration signal for each opera-
tion condition of HVCB is extracted for analysis. First,
the original vibration signal is decomposed through the
3-layer WPD method to obtain its eight-band detailed
signal. Then, the WPD energy of different frequency
bands is calculated and normalized with Eq. (2). Figure 4
shows the WPD energy distribution of the five-group
vibration signals in this paper. Figure 4 shows that the
energy distribution of different frequency bands changes
with the operation condition. However, it is still too dif-
ficult to diagnose faults directly. Thus, a novel PSO-SVM

is proposed for fault diagnosis, which uses these WPD
energies as the eigenvalue of the operating mechanism
condition.

3 Principle of the PSO-SVM Method
3.1 Theory of SVMs
Based on statistical theory, a novel learning algorithm
named SVM was proposed by Vapnik and co-authors
in the late 1990s [30]. The basic idea of SVMs is that a
non-linear issue is linearly separable in higher dimen-
sional feature space through some non-linear mapping
function. An example of the classification of two types of
data in feature space is presented in Figure 4, in which
the blue circle and white circles represent negative and
positive data, respectively. During the classification, SVM
tries to search a hyper-plane between the two different
types of data in the feature space. For higher classification
accuracy, the distance between the hyper-plane and the
nearest data point of two types is maximized. The near-
est data points are sorted as support vectors to define the
margin, which is marked by the dotted circles in Figure 5.
The hyper-plane is settled in the middle of the two mar-
gins. The support vectors established from the original
data samples contain sufficient information to define the

Page 5 of 10

hyper-plane. The other data points can be discarded after
the support vectors are confirmed. Therefore, high classifi-
cation accuracy can be achieved by an SVM with few origi-
nal data. According to previous descriptions [15-18], the
hyper-plane in high dimension feature space follows the
form in Eq. (3):

f(x) =@- g(x) + b, (3)

where ¢(x) is the so-called mapping function. The given
data are transformed into the high dimensional feature
space through this non-linear mapping function. In Eq.
(3), @ represents the weight vector, b denotes the bias
term, and w and D are applied to define the separating
hyper-plane between the two kinds of data. A data set
T = {xj, yi}7_, is introduced, where x; represents the data
samples for SVM training, y; € {—1, 1} denotes the iden-
tification of different types, and m is the number of data
samples. The separating hyper-plane should be restricted
under the following constraints:

yil@j - p(*%i) +b) => 1—- G, i= 1,2,3,...,m. (4)

A positive slack coefficient ¢; is necessary to measure the
distance between the margin and the vector +; that lie
on the wrong side. Moreover, the error penalty c imple-
ments a trade-off between the confidence interval and
the empirical risk. Finally, a corresponding constraint
optimization can be converted to a minimization issue:

Mm
min : 5|loll? +6) i bi = 0,
i (5)
s.t., viol (xi) +b) > 1- &.

Eq. (5) is a typical convex quadratic programming prob-
lem. According to the Kuhn-Tucker condition, the calcu-
lation can be simplified to an equivalent Lagrangian dual
question by introducing the Lagrangian multiplier a;:

1 m m
min : L(w,b,a) = Sllwll?+ > ai- > aigi(w - p(x) +b).

i=1 i=1

(6)
For the solution of the dual problem, the partial deriva-
tive of L is obtained concerning w and b. Since the value
of the partial derivative is zero at the minimum points,
the following equation can be obtained:

According to a previous study [15], SVM established by
the Gaussian radial basis function shows excellent non-
linear classification ability. Thus, the Gaussian radial
basis kernel function [17] is adopted to compute in the
original input space through Eq. (10):

3.2 Theory of PSO
The kernel parameter 6 and error penalty c are signifi-
cant for the classification accuracy of the SVM model.
Thus, they are predetermined by the PSO algorithm in
the study. The basic idea of the PSO algorithm is that the
optimization process can be treated as searching for opti-
mal parameters in a feature space through iterative calcu-
lations. Each particle contains a fitness value, determined
by the fitness function, and each particle has a velocity
vector to decide its flying direction and distance. During
each iteration, the particles update themselves through
two best positions: one is found by the single particle
called Pbest, and the other is found in the whole particle
group named gbest. Each particle updates its velocity and
position after an iteration step through Eq. (11) and Eq.

3.3 PSO-SVM Fault Diagnosis Model

Since an SVM is essentially a binary classifier, a one-layer
SVM model can only classify two kinds of operation
conditions of HVCBs. For the classification of a normal
condition mechanism fault and four types of operating
mechanism faults, a four-layer SVM classifier shown in
Figure 6 is constituted as the fault diagnosis model.

The obtained vibration signals are divided into two
sets: 100 groups are training samples, and the others are
testing samples. The optimal parameter combination (c,
0) of each SVM is predetermined by the PSO algorithm
with the training samples. The effectiveness of the multi-
layer SVM classifier is confirmed by the testing samples.

\

The establishment of the PSO-SVM fault diagnosis model
is described in Figure 7.
The main steps in Figure 7 can be outlined as follows:

Step 1: Initialize the particle swarm: Initialize the
particle swarm parameters, including the parti-
cle number, learning factors, weighting coefficient,
particle position and particle velocity.

Step 2: Encode the SVM parameters: Encode the
kernel parameter 6 and error penalty c of SVM as
the position of the particles. Herein, two-dimen-
sional feature space is considered.

Step 3: Train the SVM model: Train the SVM
model with the 100 groups of training samples.
The parameter pairs (c, 6) change along with the
flying of particles.

Step 4: Assess the fitness value: Calculate and
assess the fitness value of the particle with Eq. (15).
The fitness value is used to evaluate the validity of
the fault diagnosis model with an electric current
parameter combination 6 and c. A smaller fitness
value indicates higher fault diagnosis accuracy.
Step 5: Judge the stop condition: Terminate the
iteration process and obtain the optimal param-
eters of the SVM if the desired accuracy is reached.
Otherwise, proceed to the iterative calculation.
Steps 6 and 7: Update the parameters: Update the
parameter particle best Pbest with Eq. (13) and the
global best gbest with Eq. (14). Update the parti-

tion name. Normal conditions and four types of fault
conditions called cam offset, spring creep, over-travel
and mechanical stuck are included. The symbol “o” is
the real operation condition, and the symbol “*” repre-
sents the diagnosed operation condition. Overlapping
of the two symbols under the same horizontal axis value
represents the correct diagnosis. Similarly, separation of
the two symbols indicates an incorrect diagnosis. The
results show that 48 groups of testing samples are diag-
nosed correctly by the PSO-SVM. In particular, four
kinds of operation conditions, normal condition, cam
offset, over-travel and mechanical stuck, are diagnosed
with 100% accuracy. The incorrectly identified cases
can be explained from the operation process of the type
ZN12 HVCB. In the initial stage of operation, the spring
releases instantaneously, and then the cam impacts the
roller to drive the whole operating mechanism. The
energy conversion from the elastic potential energy in
the spring to mechanical energy in the operating mech-
anism is completed in this transient shock process. The
cam and spring act as the drive unit for the operating
mechanism. Spring creep can cause an initial lack of elas-
tic potential energy, thereby decreasing the mechanical
energy of the operating mechanism. Similarly, cam offset
could lower the energy utilization efficiency and decrease
the mechanical energy converted from elastic potential
energy. Both phenomena can cause delayed operation
of the operating mechanism and stimulate more similar
vibration responses. This finding also means that these
phenomena are more difficult to diagnose than other
operating mechanism faults. Therefore, other diagnosis
models and signal processing methods might be investi-
gated to diagnose these faults in the future.

4.2 Comparative Fault Diagnosis Experiment
To show the fault diagnosis performance of the PSO-
SVM, fault diagnosis models derived from a four-layer
normal SVM with a random parameter combination
(c=0.25, g=0.44) are established. In addition, the PSO-
BP neural network with an 8-dimensional input layer,
10-dimensional hidden layer, and 7-dimensional out-
put layer is also set up with the same training samples.
To prove the effectiveness of the SVM, the PSO-BP fault
diagnosis model has the same particle swarm parameters
as those of the PSO-SVM model, including the particle
number (40), learning factors (cj=c,=2), and the maxi-
mum number of iterations (500). Comparative fault
diagnosis results by the same testing samples mentioned
above are listed in Table 2.

From Table 2, it is clear that the PSO-SVM has higher
total accuracy and shorter training time than the PSO-BP

neural network. Due to the added process of particle
swarm optimization, the training time of PSO-SVM is
longer than that of normal SVM. However, the total accu-
racy has improved dramatically from 80% to 98%, which
outweighs the training time increment. This finding indi-
cates that the penalty parameter c and kernel param-
eter 6 are significant for the diagnostic accuracy and
that the optimal combination (c, 6) can be determined
by the PSO algorithm to improve the fault diagnosis
accuracy. Switching from the PSO-BP to the PSO-SVM
improves the total diagnosis accuracy from 88% to 96%
and decreases the model training time from 4093 s to 107
s. Additionally, from the standpoint of diagnostic accu-
racy, the PSO-SVM model performs better than the other
two models for every fault type. Four kinds of faults are
diagnosed with 100% accuracy by the PSO-SVM. For the
case of the PSO-BP model, only the mechanical stuck
condition can be diagnosed with 100% accuracy. No fault
diagnosis result can reach 100% accuracy by the normal
SVM. The training time increase in PSO-BP is because its
model structure is more complicated than that of PSO-
SVM. Taking variables from the topological structure
of the PSO-BP in this paper as an instance, the number
of network weight variables is 8 x 10+ 10 x7=150, and
the number of network threshold variables is 10+ 7=17.
Therefore, the total number of network variables is
150+ 17=167. Unlike the SVM, the diagnostic accuracy
of the BP model highly depends on the sample number.
Twenty groups of fault signal samples per HVCB operat-
ing mechanism fault are still not sufficient to train the BP
model, which further leads to lower diagnostic accuracy.
These findings indicate that the PSO-SVM is a powerful
tool for fault diagnosis problem with a small number of
samples.

5 Conclusions

A fault diagnosis model based on WPD energy and the
PSO-SVM is proposed to diagnose HVCB operating
mechanism faults using vibration signals from operation
experiments in the study, the main content can be sum-
marized as below:

1. The WPD energy in each frequency band of the
vibration signal from operation experiment is
extracted and taken as the fault eigenvalue to form
the input vector for the fault diagnosis model.

2. A four-layer SVM classifier is employed to perform
multi-class HVCB operating mechanism fault diag-
nosis. The PSO algorithm is applied to search for the
optimal kernel parameter 6 and penalty parameter c
for the SVM.

3. Comparative fault diagnosis experiments among
normal SVM, PSO-SVM and PSO-BP indicated that
Li et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:6

the PSO-SVM has better diagnostic performance for
HVCB operating mechanism faults.

4. The fault diagnosis model based on PSO-SVM can
overcome the limitations of traditional scheduled
maintenance, and has best comprehensive diagnosis
performance. It will, in turn, enhance the reliability of
the power grid.
