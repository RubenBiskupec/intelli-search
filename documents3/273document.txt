Abstract

The rapid development of loT technology has led to the usage of various devices in our daily life. Along with the
ever-increasing rise of the Internet of Things, the use of appropriate methods for establishing secure
communications in health care systems is vital. The adoption of high-security optimal mechanisms for this purpose
has been more effective regarding the efficiency of medical information systems; hence, many studies are being
conducted in this field today. One of the most important components is the RFID cards that can be used for
communication between entities in the environment. In healthcare systems, patient information is critical and

nobody should have access to this information. Thus, providing security for these networks is essential. Recently,
good researches have been done in the area of authentication for medical information systems, using RFID
technology, which has a low computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on elliptic curve
cryptography for vital and efficient and scalable authentication between RFID cards, card readers, and servers. This
proposed method maintains security and has less computational cost and low elliptic curve point multiplication
running time compared to similar recent methods.

1 Introduction

The term “Internet of Things” was first introduced in
1999 [1]. The Internet of Things refers to the precise
communication between the physical and digital world
[2, 3]. In fact, it provides an extensive infrastructure for
providing advanced services, such as sending and receiv-
ing information and interconnections using physical and
virtual elements [3]. The Internet of Things consists of a
set of sensors and radio frequency identification (RFID)
technology that communicate through the network with
various devices [2]. Technologies such as sensor technol-
ogy, embedded smart technology, and nanotechnology
as well as RFID technology can be widely used in the

Internet of Things. In RFID technology, objects can
communicate with one another through radio waves and
exchange information among themselves [3, 4]. Some
advantages of RFID technology in comparison with trad-
itional barcodes are the ability to read and write, lack of
direct exposure to the card-reader, simultaneous reading
of multiple cards, and non-restrictions of using different
barcodes [3, 5]. Considering the above-mentioned rea-
sons, we can use these benefits for health care systems
such as hospitals.

The components of RFID technology include servers,
card readers, and cards. The cards include various parts
including a chip that performs calculations, a memory
for data storage, an antenna for transmitting and receiv-
ing data, and a special hardware that is used for encryp-
tion and decryption operations [6-8].

Cards can communicate with the card reader and
transfer encrypted data between themselves. The cards
themselves are divided into three categories, including a
reactive card that gets the energy necessary to transmit
its data through a wireless signal, a semi-active card with
a small battery, and the active card that has a radio an-
tenna and a small battery that is directly connected to
the card reader [8, 9]. The cards can store and process
data and then transfer information to the card reader
using their radio transmitter [6, 7].

Card readers have a control unit, a memory unit, and a
radio transmitter and receiver; in addition, the capacity of
computations in card readers is more than cards, and its
main function is to create authentication and exchange
messages between the card and the server [8, 10].

A server is a trusted entity and stores all information
and ID cards and card readers in its database for proper
authentication process, and then the system starts up.
The validity of the card can be determined using this in-
formation stored in the server [8, 10].

One of the instances that can be implemented by
using RFID technology inside the Internet of Things and
in healthcare settings is the identification of the newborn
and patient [8, 11], tracing and validating the medical
treatment of patients [8, 12], patient location and patient
management in healthcare centers [8, 13], surgery
process management [8, 14], equipment location track-
ing [5, 8, 15], blood pack tracing, monitoring, and
pharmaceutical management.

All messages in healthcare environments are transmitted
by using wireless waves through RFID cards in the latter
environment. With rapid development and advances of
RFID technology in healthcare environments, the need for
safe and secure access to sensitive information should be
considered, and ultimately, the exchange of this informa-
tion should be taken into account through the Internet in-
frastructure of the objects more than before [8].
Transferring information by using RFID technology does
not provide any security by itself. Therefore, these health-
care systems are vulnerable to attacks due to the use of
RFID. In order to remove these vulnerabilities, various se-
curity protocols are provided for secure communication
within these networks, some of which are based on sym-
metric cryptography [16-25], and others are based on
asymmetric cryptography [3, 7, 26-28]. Some of these pro-
tocols deal with the authentication between the card and
the server, in which they confirm each other [3, 7, 26—28]
and others have authentication between the card and the
reader [16, 17]. In order to ensure that the connection be-
tween the card, the card reader, and the server is secure, we
need mutual authentication in RFID systems, which will
affect the authentication process against various attacks [8].

In this paper, we propose a novel method based on el-
liptic curve cryptography for vital and efficient and

scalable authentication between RFID cards, card
readers, and servers. This proposed method maintains
security and has less computational cost and low elliptic
curve point multiplication running time compared to
similar recent methods.

An elliptic curve over GF(2”) consists of all points (x,
y € GF(2”)) such that it satisfies an elliptic curve equa-
tion: E: y’ + xy = «° + ax” + b with a, b € GF(2”), b #0
(let GF(2”) be a finite field of 2” elements, where m is
an integer). For cryptographic purpose, those over the fi-
nite field of F,, and F2” are most suitable [29].

The addition of two points and doubling a point on an
elliptic curve (generally over a set of real numbers) in a
geometrical space are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. The
Group Law is supported by following terms [29]:

e Identity. P+O=O0O+P=PforallP=(,y) © E.

e Negativity: Let P= (x,y) © EandQ=(%, x+y) ©
E therefore P + Q = O, that is to say, negative of P is
Q.

e Point addition: If P = (x), y;) © E and Q = (x, yo)
© E such that P z + Q, then P + Q = (x3, 3) is
calculated by following equation:

X3 =N+A4X, +X2+a,Vy3

= (x1 + x3) +x3+y,, withd = Yo ¥ Yo

X2 + X2

e Point doubling: If P = (x1, y,) © E and P # - P, then
2P = (xp, Y2) is defined by following equation:

 

P+O = (xx, ys)

Scalar multiplication as a fundamental operation in
ECC is obtained by performing the elliptic curve
addition operation k times: Q= kKP=P+P...+P.

k

Calculating Q is relatively easy when k and P are given,
but it is a hard problem to determine k when Q and P
are specified. This problem is called the elliptic curve
discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Thus, the scalar
multiplication on elliptic curves over finite fields is con-
sidered as a one-way function which is useful in crypto-
graphic applications [30].

The structure of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 reviews the related papers; Section 3 describes the
proposed solution, including the initializing phase and
the authentication phase; Section 4 describes the dy-
namic key management; in Section 5, the analysis of the
proposed solution as well as security and its efficiency
has been addressed; and finally, the conclusions are pre-
sented in Section 6.

2 Methods and related work

Due to the sensitive information that can be exchanged
with RFID technology, security for these networks is
critical. RFID technology is one of the most important
steps in establishing secure communication in these net-
works. However, the messages exchanged between the
card, the card reader, and the server have always been
exposed to a variety of security attacks. In this paper, we
use the elliptic curve cryptography to secure the connec-
tion between the card and reader. The proposed solution

Page 3 of 11

preserves security and computational costs less than the
previous methods. Furthermore, key management solu-
tions are presented for dynamic access problems in
RFID cards in order to be able to develop scalability
healthcare networks

Various research and articles have been conducted for
RFID security in a variety of applications, which, in
addition to providing effective security schemes, identify
and discuss the following security issues [3, 7, 10, 16, 18,
25-28, 31-39]:

2.1 Mutual authentication

In most researches, interconnection between the card,
the card reader, and the server is required prior to the
initialization of the operation. The relationship between
the card and the card reader is insecure and needs to be
reciprocally authenticated, while the communication
channel between the server and card reader is assumed
to be secure.

2.2 Confidentiality

Each secret key of the card, the card reader, or their ID
must not be recovered by attackers. If the attacker ac-
cesses the card or card reader’s secret key, he/she can
introduce his/her card or card reader to the server and
access sensitive information of the network. To prevent
this, data must be encrypted before being transmitted
between the card and the card reader.

2.3 Anonymity

An RFID authentication scheme is necessary for ano-
nymity of the card and card reader. If the attacker recog-
nizes the identity of the card or card reader, he can in
fact violate their privacy; in order to prevent this issue,
the ID of the card and card reader should be encrypted
in a mutual authentication process.

2.4 Availability

The RFID authentication process should be imple-
mented accurately over the available lifetime of the card
or the card reader. To provide anonymity, for most
RFID authentication schemes, the secret keys between
the card and the card reader should be updated during
the implementation of the authentication process. If the
attacker in any way eliminates the process of updating
secret keys between the card and the card reader, the au-
thentication scheme will be invalid.

2.5 Forward security

In many authentication schemes, if an attacker can ac-
cess the secret key, he can get the old location of the
card or access the old information of that card, which
will result in the violation of the privacy of the owner of
Noori et al. EURASIP Journal on Information Security (2020) 2020:13

the card. It is therefore necessary to have the forward-
looking security within the authentication plan.

2.6 Scalability

An authentication scheme should be able to support the
number of cards or card readers in the network. For ex-
ample, if the number of cards has multiplied or the card
has been deleted, added, or its location has changed, or
even the location of the card reader has changed, the au-
thentication scheme should be able to maintain and con-
tinue to work well and correctly manage the key for the
steps listed.

2.7 Resists various attacks

A strong authentication scheme should be able to secure
the exchange of information between the card and the
card reader against multiple attacks, such as man-in-the-
middle attack, replay attack, forging attack, internal at-
tacks, and external attacks.

Various methods are used for the authentication problem
in healthcare and health systems based on the Internet of
Things that use symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
(elliptical curve cryptography) [7, 25, 31, 40-42]. The au-
thors of papers did not use asymmetric cryptographic
methods, because the key length is long in asymmetric
cryptography and thus the speed is very low, but the imple-
mented elliptical curve cryptography methods [43, 44] have
proven less storage space than the SHA3 hashing algo-
rithms [7]. Using elliptic curve cryptography, we can easily
expand our network and do not have a scalability problem
while being safe against various attacks. In contrast, sym-
metric encryption always suffers from scalability problem
[32, 33, 45-50].

The elliptic curve ciphering identification for RFID
technology was presented for the first time in 2006, by
Batina and Tuyls [51], and then, various methods were
presented by different authors, or the vulnerability of
these methods was investigated by other researchers or
new protocols have been introduced to improve their
cost and security. For example, in Lee’s paper [52],
works of Batina and Tuyls [51] and Batina et al. [53]
were investigated, and the problem of the unidentified
card was addressed.

Another article by Zhang and Qi [26] has addressed
the problems in Chou’s work [34], namely availability of
the information inside the card by the attacker, interact-
ing with the server, and card tracking, and aimed to im-
prove Chou’s authentication method. A recent paper by
Farash et al. [7] has recently been presented in the field
of RFID technology using elliptic curve cryptography for
health care systems, in which, by reviewing the methods
proposed by Zhang and Qi [26] and Zhao [3], first, ad-
dresses the security problem of these two methods in in-
secure sending of the information, and then presents his

Page 4 of 11

own security method. Another paper proposed by Yang
et al. [10] addresses the problems of the Kaur [54]
scheme, being a high computational cost; with changes
made to the Kaur scheme, he has presented a new
scheme reducing the high cost of computation.

3 Proposed scheme

In our proposed method, the server, the card reader, and
the card are all participating; first, the server generates
the keys for both the card reader and the card. Then,
the server loads the keys on them.

The proposed method has two phases: (1) initializing
phase and (2) authentication phase. The details of these
two phases are fully described below. The symbols are
listed in Table 1.

3.1 Initializing phase
This phase includes the following steps:

Step 1: The server selects the size and type of the
Galois field GF(q) which can be chosen p = qg, where p
must be a large prime number or g=2” (this field is
usually chosen because the calculations on the GF(2”)
field can be done quickly, and a fast and efficient
algorithm has been provided for required calculations
on GF(2”) field); m represents the size of the field.

Step 2: The server uses two parameters a,b € F, in
order to define the elliptic curve equation E on the field
F, shown in (1):

Pte =e tax*+b (1)

Then, the server chooses the basic point (G) for the el-
liptic curve (basic point means the point on the elliptic
curve that has the highest 1 order) that is 1G = O.

A Hash function

 
Noori et al. EURASIP Journal on Information Security (2020) 2020:13

Step 3: For each card T;, the server inserts a random
integer p,, from the interval [1, 1 — 1] as the private
key and then calculates and inserts p,, = p,,G into the
card. Also, the inverted private key p,,; | is inserted
into the card. Then, this procedure is repeated for each
card reader.

Note: Given the discrete logarithm for the elliptic
curve, having p,, and G, calculation of p,, is complicated
in practice.

Step 4: The server has a one-way hashing function h(x)
for converting a point on the elliptic curve E to a num-
ber v, where chooses v € F;.

Step 5: The server selects a random integer /; from the
range [1, 1 — 1] for each card and then calculates the
U; according to (2).

U; = 1G (2)

Therefore, the secret key for each card is obtained
from Eq. (3).

SK; = h(i) (3)

Step 6: The server specifies the public dots for the
reader, as in Eq. (4), in which the parameter 7
represents the card reader.

Mi, ; =1; (vu,),Mj, i= hi (vu,) (4)

In the end, the server stores the parameters E,, G, n,
h, p,j*> Pu, P,, and /; for the card and the parameters
Ey Gy hy p,j *s Pu,» Pr, and Mi, j=]; (Bu,)» Mj, i = Lil
Pu,) for the card reader.

3.2 Authentication phase

In this phase, the card and card reader authenticate each
other using the secret key. This phase includes the fol-
lowing steps:

Step 1: To calculate U;, each card reader is to get its
public points and inverted private key already loaded by
the server at the initial phase, then U; is calculated by
Eq. (5):

Uj; =1jG=p,;*Mi, ;j (5)

Page 5 of 11

It should be noted that p,; ' denotes inversion in a fi-

nite field, which is an operation required in the digital
signature algorithm of the elliptic curve [55].
Step 2: Determining the secret key according to Eq.

(6):
SK) = (Ut) 6

Step 3: In this step, we obtain the value of w according
to Eq. (7):

w =h(SK; + SK;) (7)

w is used for two-way authentication. The card reader
calculates the value of w, which is hashing of the sum of
values SK; and SK;. It is used in the symmetric encryp-
tion procedure that encrypts the message (m) if the card
is able to calculate the value of w, then is able to authen-
ticate the card reader.

In fact, when the card reader communicates with the
cards, it can authenticate them, and it is enough to cal-
culate the secret key for the card; also, the card must
calculate the value of w in order to authenticate the card
reader. The authentication phase is shown in Fig. 3:

For example, Fig. 4 illustrates a cluster with card
reader and cards with a certain relationship. In this fig-
ure, there are 7 cards and one card reader. There is a bi-
directional relationship between each card and card
reader, and only the card reader is able to calculate the
secret key for the cluster members. The server deter-
mines the public parameters M, ; and M,, ; and declares
them to the card reader. The set of required public pa-
rameters for deriving the secret key by card reader is
shown as follows:

= I3(Pu,),Mia = la(Pu,),Mis — Is (Pu), M16

Therefore, the card reader in addition to its secret key
can derive secret keys of cluster members as follows:

Reader = h(U;) = n(P,, 'Mi,)
= h(U») = n(P,, 'Mi2)
=h(U3) = n(P,, ‘My 3)
= h(Uy) = n(P,, 'Mi4)
=h(Us) = n(P,, ‘My 5)
=h(Us) = n(P,, 'Mi.6)
=h(U;) = n(P,, 'Mi,)
—h(Us) = n(P, Mis)

Note that no card or card reader can operate autono-
mously unless it has permission from the server, in
which case it must receive the required public points
from the server.

Fig. 5 Switch card reader and communication between cluster
members and new card reader

 

 

creating a new relationship (switch card reader), and
changing secret keys will be discussed.

4.1 Adding new card

Imagine that a new card T,, is added to Fig. 4. In this
case, the private, public keys, and reverse private key will
be embedded within new card by the server, then steps 5
to 6 of initializing phase will repeat, and the type of rela-
tionship between the card and card reader will be a bi-
directional one like the other cards. The details are as
follows:

Step 1: Select a random integer P,. from the interval [1,
n — 1] as a secret parameter for each new card T,, by
the server; then, the point P,, = P,,.G is computed as a
public parameter, and both of them are embedded in
the new card. Moreover, the reverse private key P, * is
embedded within the new card too.

Step 2: The server selects a random integer J, for the
new card from interval [1, n — 1]. Thus, the secret key
of the card T;, is SK, = h(U,,) = h(L,G)

Step 3: The server determines the points M; . = L(Py,)
and M,, » = 1,(P,,,) to communicate between the card
reader and the new card and declares it publicly.

4.2 Removing the existing card

Imagine there is a need for a card to be removed from
Fig. 4 for any reason, like the case when cards are cap-
tured by an attacker. Under this condition, the server
should remove all parameters in contact with the card
mentioned above and revoke the access to the card too.
In addition, the secret key of the card reader must be
changed as follows:
Noori et al. EURASIP Journal on Information Security (2020) 2020:13

Step 1: The server reselects a random integer J, from
the interval [1, m — 1] for card reader. As a result, the
new secret key of the card reader is SK, = h(U,).

4.3 Revoking an existing relationship and creating a new
relationship (switch card reader)

Imagine that a new card reader is selected for cluster
members (cards), and the previous card reader con-
tinues to carry out tasks in another cluster (as shown
in Fig. 5).

Then, all communications which the card reader has
with cards must be removed. Furthermore, all public pa-
rameters and those which connect the cluster members
to the card reader and vice versa should also are re-
moved. To build communication between the cluster
members and the new card reader, steps 5 to 6 of initial-
izing phase should be executed as follows:

Step 1: The server selects a random integer /; from
interval [1, 7 — 1] for each card. Therefore, the secret
key for each the card is SK; = h(U;) = h(/;G).

Step 2: The server determines the points M,, ; = /;(P.,)
and M;, ; = U(P,,,) for communication between the new
card reader and each single card, and declares it
publicly.

4.4 Changing secret keys

Sometimes changing a secret key is felt necessary per-
haps to ensure higher network security and efficiency.
Changing the secret key of a card T, from SK, to SK;
follows the below procedure:

Step 1: The server selects a random integer J, from
interval [1, 7 - 1]. Therefore, the new secret key of the
card T, is SK* = h(I.G)

Step 2: The server determines the points M,, , = [7 (
P,,) and M;, x = U, (Py,) declares it publicly.

5 Security and performance results and
discussions

5.1 Security

The following are some of the important attacks and the
resistance of the proposed method against them and
some security requirements:

5.1.1 Man-in-the-middle attack

In this attack, the attacker is trying to retrieve secret and
private keys through intercepting communication chan-
nel between the card and card reader. In this case, the
attacker cannot extract any useful information. Even if
we assume that the attacker retrieves w while the card
and card reader are communicating, but based on
ECDLP, he cannot get the private key to use it and com-
municate with the card reader or card.

5.1.2 Forging attack

Identity forging attacks are difficult to detect in these net-
works because the attacker is trying to forge an authorized
card ID in order to get the card’s secret key. Now, assume
that the attacker is trying to get the card’s secret key,
which requires solving discrete logarithm for the elliptic
curve. Given the resistance of the discrete logarithm for
the elliptic curve, as outlined in Johnson et al. [56], the
proposed method will be reliable against this attack.

5.1.3 Mutual authentication

In the proposed method, if the value of SK; is equal to
SK;, then the card reader has been able to authenticate
the card, and if the card can calculate the value of w, it
will authenticate the card reader.

5.1.4 Confidentiality
Based on ECDLP, the attacker cannot retrieve the pri-
vate key from the messages.

5.1.5 Masquerade attack

There is an extraordinarily important attack whenever a
card wants to compute authorized secret keys. Imagine
that a malicious card reader masquerades like the server
and distributes some planned public parameters M, ;
and M,, ;. Then, assume some cards use these public pa-
rameters to compute secret keys SK;. If this card uses
SK; as a proper symmetric key and sends it to the card
reader encrypted confidential data, then the malicious
card reader, with the proper secret key SK;, can decrypt
and access those confidential data. An authentication
mechanism such as the proposed scheme in Nikoogha-
dam et al. [57], improved by the changes suggested by
the present researchers, is able to stand against this at-
tack. Although a number of overheads are imposed, they
are fewer than ECDSA digital signature algorithm [56]
used in [58]. Furthermore, suppose a constant and
unique private key such as a has been selected by the
server, and the resultant public key Q = aG is registered
in the server as trusted for all cards and has been regis-
tered in the server. In the following, the employment of
digital signature is described step by step.

(a) The server prepares special information
corresponding to each public parameter M,, ; and
M,, i» like a digital signature as follows:

1. Selecting a random integer such as f.

2. Computing the point R = 6G = (xo yo) on
agreed elliptic curve and assigning r = x) mod n.
If r = 0, then go to step 1.

3. Converting all public parameter M,, ; and M, ;
into an integer e using a secure one-way hash

(b) Each card verifies the validity of public parameters
M,, ; and M,, ; before using it to compute the
assigned secret key as follows:

1. Converting received M, ; and M, ; to e by hash
function.

2. Computing v = sG.

3. Computing s° = erQ + R; consider that r is the
x-coordinate of the received point R and Q is
the reliable public key of the server.

4. Ifv=s’, then signature is valid; otherwise, it is
rejected.

As an example for card reader, the server signs all
public parameter M, ; and M,, ; of the cluster members
which have been converted to an integer e by one-way
hash function and sends besides the public parameters
(M,, ;»M,;, ;) to the card reader. Then, card reader public
parameter converts to one integer e and investigates the
signature verification following the steps explained
above.

Table 2 shows the security comparison between re-
lated protocols and the proposed method. This is a com-
parison between recent research papers such as Farash
et al. [7], Alamr et al. [35], Zhang and Qi [26], Zhao [3],
Liao and Hsiao [36], Shen et al. [28], and the proposed
method in this research.

5.2 Performance

To evaluate the performance, we have compared our
proposed method with similar recent research papers
such as Farash et al. [7], Alamr et al. [35], Zhang and Qi
[26], Zhao [3], Liao and Hsiao [36], Shen et al. [28]. We

4. Computing s = (are + f) mod n.

5. Publishing certain couple information (s,R)
along with public parameters M,, ; and M, ;

estimated the cost of the authentication phase for each
of the six methods, for both the card reader and card. In
Table 3, we present some of the various symbols used in
this section.

On the other hand, according to the method proposed
in Nikooghadam et al. [59], the complexity of time for
implementation of various operational phases is calcu-
lated using modular exponentiation. The results are spe-
cified in Table 4.

The comparison between the six methods is shown in
Table 5. Since all of the public and private keys and
other main parameters are loaded into the card and card
reader in the initialization phase, thus, the computa-
tional cost of the private and public keys and other pa-
rameters is zero. In the authentication phase of our
method, the computational cost is 27}, + 1Tpj, and 27},
+ 17 py for the card and card reader, respectively. There-
fore, our proposed method has lower computational
cost, when compared to other methods.

It should be noted, due to the fact that time complexity
for modular exponentiation in operating unit Ty, and Tp,
is not high, the related values are excluded from Table 5.

As shown in Fig. 6, the performance comparison is il-
lustrated in Table 5.

It is also possible to calculate the execution time of
the most complex operations on elliptic curve, that is,

the elliptic curve point multiplication in milliseconds.
For instance, we assume that all of the related articles
use an elliptic curve with an equal key length of 160 bits.
The execution time of the elliptical curve point multipli-
cation on 5 MHZ cards equals 0.064 s. The running time
of the elliptic curve point multiplication among the re-
lated protocols for both the card and the card reader is
given in Table 6.

6 Conclusion

Considering the constant developments of the Internet
of Things and its applications in fields such as health
care systems, where patient information is critical and
nobody should have access to this information, then pro-
viding security for these networks is essential. Various
studies have been done recently to address security and
computational cost problems. In this paper, we have
proposed an elliptic curve cryptography method that, in
addition to maintaining security, has less computational
cost compared to similar studies. Furthermore, key man-
agement solutions are presented for dynamic access
problems in RFID cards in order to be able to develop
scalability healthcare networks. For future work, a hard-
ware implementation can also be done in order to evalu-
ate the precise security and computational cost of the
proposed method.
