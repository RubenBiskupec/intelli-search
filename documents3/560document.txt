Abstract

Deep-sea sediment is extremely important in marine scientific research, such as that concerning marine geology and
microbial communities. The research findings are closely related to the in-situ information of the sediment. One pre-
requisite for investigations of deep-sea sediment is providing sampling techniques capable of preventing distortion
during recovery. As the fruit of such sampling techniques, samplers designed for obtaining sediment have become
indispensable equipment, owing to their low cost, light weight, compactness, easy operation, and high adaptability
to sea conditions. This paper introduces the research and application of typical deep-sea sediment samplers. Then,

a representative sampler recently developed in China is analyzed. On this basis, a review and analysis is conducted
regarding the key techniques of various deep-sea sediment samplers, including sealing, pressure and temperature
retaining, low-disturbance sampling, and no-pressure drop transfer. Then, the shortcomings in the key techniques
for deep-sea sediment sampling are identified. Finally, prospects for the future development of key techniques for
deep-sea sediment sampling are proposed, from the perspectives of structural diversification, functional integration,
intelligent operation, and high-fidelity samples. This paper summarizes the existing samplers in the context of the key
techniques mentioned above, and can provide reference for the optimized design of samplers and development of

key sampling techniques.

1 Introduction

Deep-sea sediment is of great importance for under-
standing changes in the Earth’s environment, predicting
future environmental and climate changes, exploiting and
utilizing new energy sources on the seabed, and studying
the extreme microbial diversity of oceans and biologi-
cal genetic resources [1]. However, due to the existence
of water layers, the knowledge and utilization of marine
resources are greatly restricted [2]. To overcome this
restriction, deep-sea sediment samplers have emerged.
Since the first sampling of deep-sea sediment by humans
in 1872, deep-sea sediment samplers have become
indispensable technical equipment for seabed resource

exploration, marine geological surveys, and marine sci-
entific investigations [3-5], and have been valued and
applied by the world’s maritime powers. Many scientific
research findings have been applied to actual marine sur-
vey projects, and considerable economic and social ben-
efits have been achieved, highlighting the scientific value
of deep-sea sediment samplers [6, 7].

However, as people pay more attention to the ocean
and sampling requirements, deep-sea sampling also faces
many problems. For example, interactions between the
sampler and sediment cause the original layer of the sedi-
ment to bend, deform, and compress, thereby destroying
the integrity of the sample information [8]. Sampling in
a high-pressure, low-temperature water environment will
also cause changes in the pressure and temperature of
the sample, leading to gas phase dissolution, component
loss, decomposition of organic matter, death of baro-
philic microorganisms, changes of chemical gradients,

Therefore, identifying how to provide the most primi-
tive sediment samples for human activities and scientific
research has remained the focus of research worldwide.
The parts of this paper are organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 addresses typical samplers used worldwide. Sec-
tion 3 summarizes existing samplers in the context of
the key techniques of sealing, pressure and temperature-
retaining, and reducing or eliminating disturbances and
pressure drop transfers, providing reference for the opti-
mized design of samplers and development of key sam-
pling techniques. In Section 4, the shortcomings of the
key techniques for deep-sea sediment sampling are iden-
tified, and future development prospects are proposed.

2 Application of Deep-Sea Sediment Sampler
Currently, deep-sea sediment samplers mainly include
the following devices: the pressure core barrel (PCB)
[11] (Figure 1) adopted by the Deep Sea Drilling Project,
advanced piston corer (APC) [12] and pressure core sam-
pler (PCS) [13] (Figure 2) adopted by the Ocean Drill-
ing Program, Fugro pressure corer (FPC) (Figure 3) and
rotary corer (HRC) (Figure 4) used in hydrate auto-clave
coring equipment (HYACE) [14, 15], pressure tempera-
ture core sampler (PTCS) [16] and hybrid PCS [17] (Fig-
ure 5) developed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth
Science and Technology, multiple autoclave corer (MAC)
and dynamic autoclave piston corer(DAPC) designed by
the German Ministry of Education and Research [18],
high pressure temperature coring system (HPTC) devel-
oped by the Gulf of Mexico Joint Industry Project [19],
and MeBo Druckkern Probennehmer (MDP) [20] devel-
oped by the MeBo German Ministry of Education and
Research. Detailed descriptions of the samplers men-
tioned above have been provided in many documents,
and thus will not be repeated here [21] (Table1).

The research on deep-sea sediment samplers in China
started relatively late (in the 1980s), and the related research
also lagged behind developed countries, such as the United
States, Japan, and Germany. In recent years, with the
increasing tension regarding global energy and great impor-
tance attached to the exploitation of marine resources,
China has also intensified its research on deep-sea sedi-
ment exploration [22]. In 2007, China officially launched a
national high-tech R&D program (863 Program) for man-
aging research in the marine technology field. Two key
projects were included in the program: one concerned a
technique for designing pressure-and temperature-retaining
samplers and treating the collected samples, and the other
was a natural gas hydrate coring technique [23, 24]. In 2016,
China officially launched research on key projects of the
national R&D program, including “Deep-Sea Key Technolo-
gies and Equipment” [25-27].

2.1 Non-pressure Insulation Corer

In 2016, Lu et al. from the National Deep Sea Center pro-
posed a motor-driven sampler comprising cobalt-rich
crust core samplers mounted on a‘Jiao Long” manned
submersible [28, 29]. The sampler was mainly comprised
of a battery, control system cabin, start-stop trigger mag-
net, deep-sea motor and flexible transmission shaft,
gearbox, core drilling tool, and clamp handle. After the
sampler reached a designated position in a cobalt-rich
crust mine area, the submarine operator manipulated
the mechanical arms to position the sampler and drill
for samples. The power source of the sampler was the
deep-sea battery, as combined with the deep-sea motor.
The power of the battery was 400 W. The maximum
working water depth was 4000 m, and the collected sea-
bed cobalt-rich crust samples reached up to 100 mm in
length and 16 mm in diameter. The rock stratum hard-
ness value was greater than or equal to six. After the
drilling test, the sampler was mounted on the “Jiao Long”
manned submersible; two submersible sampling opera-
tions were conducted during the 37th China Ocean voy-
age. The drilling lasted approximately 20 min each time
and several rock core samples were obtained, meeting
the requirements for deep-sea applications. The sampler
was designed to collect cobalt-crusted hard rock samples,
and thus did not apply any techniques for pressure and
temperature-retention.

In 2003, a research team at Hunan University of Sci-
ence and Technology led by Professor Wan Buyan devel-
oped China’s first deep-sea shallow seabed sampling
drilling rig [30-32]. The sampling rig was powered by
an underwater battery or umbilical cable, with a drill-
ing depth of 0.7—2 m. The rig conducted core sampling
over 1000 times within 3000 m in the Pacific and Indian
Oceans during the China Ocean resource survey voyages.
It has conducted the most core samplings in real seabed
environments world wide. In 2005, the seabed sampling
rig was operated in the sea 147 times and 111 core sam-
ples were obtained, ultimately contributing to United
Nations approval of exploitation rights for an interna-
tional seabed mining area. In 2008, a cobalt-rich crust
drill with a unique multiple coring function was success-
fully developed by the 863 Program, and has been suc-
cessfully applied in investigations conducted during the
China Ocean voyages [33].

In 2015, the Hunan University of Science and Tech-
nology and Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey
jointly developed the “Hainiu” sampling rig [34]. This
sampling rig was suitable for a water depth of 3500 m
and drilling depth of 90 m. It could obtain a core with
a diameter of 62 mm. It was equipped with one drill-
ing tool of 3.3 m, 23 drill pipes of 2.5 m, and 24 core
pipes of 3 m. It adopted rope coring for coring soft mud

multi-functional in-situ test instrument for performing
in-situ tests on the end resistance, friction force, pore
water pressure, and temperature of the layers, and for
taking pictures of soil particles. It has become repre-
sentative of China’s seabed drilling rigs. The “Hainiu’”
deep-sea drilling rig successfully completed a sea trial

in the South China Sea in June 2015. In August 2018,
it collected the first natural gas hydrate core samples
in the South China Sea. The length of the total samples
was 346.48 m, and the average core-taking rate reached
as high as 90.98%. Thus, a new breakthrough in China’s
equipment for marine mineral resources exploration
and acquisition was achieved.

2.2 Pressure Corer

In 2009, the Changsha Institute of Mining Research
designed a tight rock corer (TRC) [35] (Figure 6) capa-
ble of obtaining hard cores. The sampler included an
outer tube, sampling tube, pressure-compensation cyl-
inder, transmission, motor, high-pressure ball valve
components, and pumps. The outer tube of the sam-
pler was connected to transmission equipment. Driven
by the motor, the core sampling head rotated with the
outer tube, and a cylindrical core was obtained during
the continuous drilling process. When the sampling was
completed, the water pump began operation; the driving
water flowed through the space between the outer tube
and sampling tube to the bottom of the sampling tube,
and the cylindrical core moved upward into the pressure-
compensation cylinder under hydrodynamic action. At
this time, two high-pressure ball valves located above and
below the pressure-compensation cylinder were closed,
and then the pressure-compensation cylinder was sealed.
A pressure-compensating cylinder released pressure
to compensate for the loss of pressure within the pres-
sure-compensation cylinder. The sampler was designed
for hard cores, which can maintain the pressure of the
sample. The sampler had good pressure-retaining per-
formance, but did not have any techniques for retaining
temperature.

In 2016, Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni-
versity, and Hunan University of Science and Technology
jointly undertook a National Key R&D Program of China
entitled “Development of the Gas-tight Sampler for Full-
ocean-depth Sediment.’ Among them, the Marine Engi-
neering Laboratory of Hunan University of Science and
Technology developed a gas-tight sampler for full-ocean-
depth sediment. The maximum working water depth of
the sampler can reach 11500 m; the sample diameter is
54 mm, and the coring depth is more than 350 mm. The
sampler is simple in structure, and easy to operate. The
sampler can be mounted on a remotely operated vehi-
cle (ROV), and only a single mechanical arm is needed
to collect the sediment and seal it. During the recovery
of the sampler, a pressure-compensation device can be
used for real-time pressure compensation of the sam-
ple, to realize pressure-retaining sampling. The sediment
sampler is an important supporting facility for scientific
research on manned submersibles in China. However,
the temperature-retaining function of the sampler has
not been applied, and a sea trial has yet to be completed.

2.3 Pressure and Insulation Corer

Qin et al. from Zhejiang University proposed a manipula-
tor-holding pressure and insulation corer (MHPIC) [36]
(Figure 7). The sampler was mainly composed of sam-
pling parts, pressure-resistant parts, pressure-holding

Page 4 of 17

parts, pressure-compensation parts, and an auxiliary
frame structure. The sampling parts comprised a knife
barrel, sampling tube, and handle; the pressure-holding
parts comprised a pressure-holding cylinder body and
upper and lower end covers. When sampling, the sam-
pling tube was located outside the pressure-holding cyl-
inder, and a flap was opened and placed on the side of the
pressure-holding cylinder. When the sampler reached the
designated location, the manipulator was forced to press
down, and the sampler was inserted into the sediment
vertically. When the sediment entered the sampling tube,
another manipulator pulled the handle upwards, and the
sampling tube entered the pressure-holding cylinder.
Then, the flap was closed to seal the sample and hold the
pressure. The sampler had a design pressure of 70 MPa
and a working water depth of 7000 m. It could collect
samples of seabed sediment up to 290 mm in length and
69 mm in diameter.

The hand-held sediment pressure-holding sampler
pulled the sampling tube into the pressure-holding cyl-
inder using manned submersible manipulators. It did
not require a submersible to provide power, or another
power source. It was light and portable, allowing the
manipulators to change the samplers for unlimited sam-
pling in time and place. It had a pressure-compensator
for maintaining the pressure of samples. The pressure
changes of the samples did not exceed 15% within 6 h,
and the pressure holding effect was good. Passive insu-
lation was achieved through an insulation material and
plating technique.

In 2006, the State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Res-
ervoir Geology and Exploitation(of Southwest Petroleum
University) developed a hydraulic pressure and tempera-
ture preservation corer (HPTP) [37]. The sampler mainly
included a pressure chamber and sampling tube, hydrau-
lic source, balance system, release mechanism, pressure
compensator, drive mechanism, and sealing device. The
pressure chamber was composed of four parts: an upper
tube, middle tube, and lower tube, and retaining rings
between each of the tubes. The sampler had a maximum
working pressure of 30 MPa, and an operating tempera-
ture of 0 to 40 °C. When the sampler reached the sam-
pling point, the hydraulic source began operation, and
the drive mechanism pushed the sampling drill into
the seabed. When the sampling was completed, a sole-
noid valve sent a signal. At this time, the sampling tube
was pulled up into the pressure chamber. Then, the flap
located at the lower end of the pressure chamber was
closed, and the sealing was completed. Thereafter, the
pressure compensator released pressure to compensate
for the loss of pressure in the pressure chamber. In addi-
tion, the sampler used a passive insulation method to
maintain the temperature of the sample. Sampling tests
He et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:66

at water depths of 1367 m and 1410 m in the northern
part of the South China Sea obtained pressure-holding
sediments of 850 mm and 1000 mm, respectively. The
pressure of the sediment rose by 6.5%-—13.7% of the in-
situ pressure within 24 h; the sediment temperature rose
by 4.3-6.5 °C within 170 min. Thus, the sampler showed
good pressure-and temperature-holding performance; it
is currently mainly used for the collection of natural gas
hydrates.

In 2014, Chen et al. of Zhejiang University proposed
a novel subsea hydraulic pressure-retained multi-tube
sediment corer (PRMSC) [38]. The sampler mainly con-
sisted of a bracket, two independent sampling devices,
a hydraulic system, and a real-time monitoring system.
Each sampling device had a separate two-stage hydrau-
lic system with a piston rod that connected toa sampling
tube. Two ball valves were installed in the sampling tube,
for sealing and holding the pressure of the pressure cyl-
inder. Areal-time monitoring system included a cam-
era with a light, along with an altimeter, attitude sensor,
battery, and control unit, so that the sampler could be
monitored in real time; the signal was transmitted to the
deck via a coaxial cable. The ship operator could select an
appropriate sampling position based on the monitoring
signal, and could control the sampling speed and perform
the sampling operation for the sediment. To validate its
performance, an offshore test was conducted at a water
depth of 1035 m in the South China Sea, and two sedi-
ment samples with in-situ pressures were successfully
obtained. The sampler adopted the ball valve self-sealing
technology, and the pressure-holding effect was good; the
temperature of the sample was maintained by heating the
sampling tube in a water bath.

In 2015, a schematic for a hole bottom freezing corer
for gas hydrates (HBFC) [39] was developed by the Bei-
jing Institute of Exploration Engineering of the China
Geological Survey. It adopted a modular design, which
mainly consisted of salvaging an anchor head, drive sec-
tion, accumulator, valve block section, pressure-main-
taining core cylinder, and pressure- maintaining valve
section. The sampler was designed for a maximum work-
ing pressure of 30 MPa, and could collect a sample with
a diameter of 52 mm and length of 1 m. The sampler’s
temperature-maintaining mechanism used the structure
of a vacuum tube (a double-layered tube which was vacu-
umed in the middle) to slow the heat exchange between
the sampler and outside. The pressure-retaining function
was achieved by a piston accumulator and flap sealing
mechanism, which automatically compensated for the
pressure of the sampling tube. A total of 18 samples were
recovered from the South China Sea; 14 samples had
pressures greater than 10 MPa, and the average pressure-
maintaining ratio reached 77.7%.

3 Key Techniques for Sampling Deep-Sea
Sediment
3.1 Sealing Technology
One of the most evident features of modern samplers
concerns maintaining the original pressure of the deep-
sea sediment. One prerequisite for holding pressure is
the design of a reliable sealing structure for ensuring reli-
able sealing after the sample enters the pressure cylinder.
At present, commonly used sampler sealing structures
mainly include steel-on-steel seals (such as a steel-on-
steel plus seal ring), piston seals, valve seals, flap seals,
and ice seals. The seals used in deep-sea samplers are
mostly combinations of the above-mentioned seals. The
sealing structures of currently-used samplers can be clas-
sified into five types: steel-on-steel and valve, steel-on-
steel and flap, piston and flap, double ball valve, and ice
seal.

In the steel-on-steel and valve sealing technique, the
upper end of the pressure-retaining cylinder or sampling
tube is sealed by the steel-on-steel seal, and the lower end
comprises a valve. There are mainly two types of valves:
ball valves, and butterfly valves. The working principles of
the two types of valves are basically the same. When sam-
pling, the sampling tube is inserted into an annular hole
of the rotary ball valve. After sampling, the sampling tube
is lifted up, and the ball valve is rotated by 90° under the
action of the driving mechanism or external force, and
the lower end of the pressure-retaining cylinder is sealed.
Steel-on-steel seals are usually used in combination with
O-shaped seal rings; this approach thus concerns a tradi-
tional way of sealing [40—42]. Ball valves have good wear
resistance. They are ground manually, with reliable seal-
ing performance and a long service life. This type of seal-
ing is widely used in deep-sea samplers such as the PCB,
PCS, and hybrid PCS.

In the steel-on-steel and flap sealing technique, the
upper end of the pressure-retaining cylinder or sampling
pipe is sealed by the steel-on-steel seal, and the lower
end comprises a flap. When sampling, the flap opens
under the action of the sampling pipe. After sampling,
the sampling tube is lifted up to the exact point where
it stopped contact with the flap, and the flap is turned
over by a driving mechanism (such as a torsion spring). A
cone surface is used to seal the lower end of the pressure-
retaining cylinder. Compared with the ball valve seal, the
flap sealing structure is simpler; it avoids the problems of
highly-precise cooperation, and is also easy to disassem-
ble and maintain. Thus, the advantages are outstanding.
The MHPIC uses this sealing technology.

In the sealing technique combining a piston and flap,
the upper end of the pressure-retaining cylinder adopts
a piston seal, and the lower end adopts a valve seal. This
sealing structure is similar to the steel-on-steel-valve
He et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:66

combined valve, except that the piston at the upper end
of the sampling cylinder serves as a seal. After the sam-
pling, the entire sampler is lifted by a wire rope con-
nected to the piston (at which time the piston is in close
contact with the sampling cylinder), and the top of the
sampling cylinder is sealed. When the sampling cylin-
der enters the pressure chamber, the flap valve is closed
by a driving mechanism, and the lower end of the pres-
sure chamber is sealed. The use of a piston seal not only
achieves a sealing effect, but also reduces the disturbance
of the sediment during the sampling process. This type of
sealing is widely used in deep-sea samplers. For example,
the PTPC, MAC, DAPC, FPC, and HRC use this seal-
ing structure. In addition, China’s PIC (Figure 8) sampler
uses this sealing method; the difference is that it uses a
torsion spring to close the flap.

In the sealing technique based on a double ball valve,
the upper and lower ends of the pressure-retaining cyl-
inder and sampling pipe are sealed by ball valves. Com-
pared with the combination of a steel-on-steel seal and
valve, the double-ball valve seals are simple and compact
in structure, good in sealing performance, and easy to
operate and maintain. The upper and lower ends of the
pressure cylinders of the HPTC, TRC, and TKP-1 are all
sealed using rotary ball valves.

In the ice seal technique, an ice valve is used for seal-
ing and holding pressure, i.e., the drilling fluid is frozen
into an ice valve at the bottom of the core tube in situ,
thereby forming a seal [43] (Figure 9). For sampling gen-
eral sediment, most of the existing pressure-holding seals
have used ball valves to seal the lower end of the core
tube, which have worked well. However, in harsh envi-
ronments rich in solid particles, a ball valve can have dif-
ficulty achieving a reliable seal, and sometimes cannot
even be closed. Despite the design of a pressure compen-
sator, it is difficult to completely compensate for the pres-
sure drop in the core tube caused by the non-tight valve

Page 6 of 17

seal, resulting in low or no pressure. The ice seal struc-
ture is especially suitable for sampling in low-tempera-
ture environments of the deep sea, as there is no need to
install moving parts (such as ball valves). Highly-precise
cooperation and conventional seals are not needed. Prac-
tice has proven that the sampling technique of pressure-
retaining ice is highly adaptable to complex environments
containing solid particles [44, 45].

At present, most of the pressure-retaining seals used
in samplers are valve-based structures whose seal-
ing performance is good. Except for the MHPIC, most
samplers have adopted ball or butterfly valve seals,
owing to the superior performance of these valves in
the complex environments of the deep sea. However,
the valve structure must overcome two difficulties: one
is determining how to cooperate with an O-shaped ring
seal; the other is that the use of a valve seal will increase
the complexity of the overall structure of the sampler,
e.g., causing the need to use an external force or drive
mechanism to rotate the ball valve to achieve the seal-
ing effect. Therefore, there are now samplers (such as
the MHPIC) that use flap seals to solve the above-men-
tioned difficulties. As the drive mechanism of flap seals
is relatively simple, only a torsion spring is needed. At
present, the ice seal structure is widely used in natural
gas sampling [46-49].

3.2 Pressure-Retaining Technique

After the sampling, the sampling tube is transferred
to the pressure cylinder, and the pressure cylinder is
sealed when the first step of pressure retaining is com-
pleted. During the recovery process of the sampler,
pressure losses may occur due to leakage, elastic defor-
mation, and external temperature difference(s). There-
fore, it is necessary to design a pressure-compensation
device for the pressure cylinder. At present, the sampler

commonly uses accumulators to achieve pressure com-

types: passive pressure-retaining techniqueswith an

and pressure-retaining techniques with an _ internal
accumulator.

a certain pressure gas through a high-pressure hose and
valve. The lower chamber is connected to the sampler
pressure barrel through a high-pressure hose. The work-
ing principle is Boyle’s law, i.e., the gas pressure is nega-
tively and linearly related to the volume.

Before sampling, the accumulator is pre-charged with
a certain pressure of gas (usually 70%—80% of the hydro-
static pressure at the sampling point) through the high-
pressure valve. During the diving of the sampler, as the
pressure gradually increases, the piston in the accumu-
lator moves up and the gas is compressed, resulting in
increased pressure. When the working pressure of the
upper chamber reaches the maximum level, the sleeve
valve is opened to ensure a constant pressure in the pres-
sure cylinder. After sampling, the accumulator releases
the gas pressure, to compensate for the pressure loss in

the pressure cylinder. The PPRT structure only requires
a cylinder, piston, high-pressure valve and high-pressure
hose. It is simple in structure, convenient to operate,
and excellent in pressure-retaining performance. This
pressure-retaining technique is widely used in deep-sea
sampling; the MHPIC, HPTP, TRC, MAC, and DAPC all
adopt this pressure-retaining technique.

3.2.2 Active Pressure-Retaining Technique with External
Accumulator (APRT)

The APRT and the PPRT are similar in regards to work-

ing principle. The difference in the APRT concerns

the pressure compensation control. As shown in Fig-

with sufficient gas through the high-pressure valve.
After the sampling, when the pressure in the pres-

sends a signal, and the electromagnetic valve starts.
At this time, the pneumathode releases the gas pres-
sure to compensate for the pressure loss in the pressure
cylinder. This pressure-retaining technique is mainly
used for pressure-retaining sampling in shallow sea

suitable in harsh environments, e.g., with ultra-high
pressures and low temperatures. The gravity piston
corer and PRMSC sampler use this technique.

3.2.3 Pressure-Retaining Technique with Internal
Accumulator (PRT)
As shown in the Figure 12, the entire accumulator is
placed inside the sampler. Before sampling, the accu-
mulator chamber is filled with a certain pressure of
gas through the pressure inlet and sleeve valve; the
accumulator is connected to the seawater, and during
the diving process of the sampler, the pressure in the
accumulator gradually increases. During the sampling
process, the accumulator and sampling tube are inde-
pendent of each other; after the sampling, the rack and
pinion mechanism work to rotate the ball valve to 90°,
at which time the sampling cylinder is closed. The pres-
sure entrance is connected with the accumulator, and
the pressure relief hole is collected with the safety valve.
During the recovery process of the sampler, the pres-
sure difference between the inside and outside of the
sampling cylinder increases. Once the sample cylinder
has a pressure loss, the high-pressure gas in the accu-
mulator will push the piston to move left and right, so
that the sampling cylinder maintains pressure stabil-
ity. The PRT is compact in structure, small in size, and
superior in pressure-retaining performance. It has been
widely used in sampling for deep-sea sediments and
in drilling for natural gas. The PCB, PCS, PTCS, FPC,
HRC, Hybrid PCS, HPTC, MDP all adopt this pressure-
retaining technique.

3.3 Temperature-Retaining Technique

The temperature of seawater usually increases with
depth. The temperature at depths above 6000 m under-
water is approximately zero, a dramatic difference from
the temperature of the land. Temperature is an important

Page 10 of 17

factor affecting the in-situ information of sediments. To
obtain real information of a sediment, it is necessary to
maintain the temperature of the obtained samples. At
present, there are two types of temperature-retaining
techniques for samplers at home and abroad:passive
temperature-retaining techniques (PTRTs), and active
temperature-retaining techniques (ATRTs).

3.3.1 Passive Temperature-Retaining Techniques (PTRTs)

A PTRT selects special temperature-retaining materials,
and uses a reasonable temperature-retaining structure to
maintain a constant temperature. Common passive tem-
perature-retaining techniques include vacuum porous
insulation, seawater cooling, vacuum multilayer insu-
lation, and spraying insulation coatings on surfaces. A
temperature- and pressure-retaining drill of a natural
gas hydrate sampler developed by China adopts a pas-
sive temperature-retaining technique. The sampling tube
adopts a double-layered pipe structure with a vacuum
in the middle, an insulation coating sprayed on the
inner surface of the sampling tube, and a ceramic mate-
rial, such as ZrO2/CaO sprayed on the external surface of
the sampling tube [50, 51].

The MAC and DAPC are equipped with a steel fire-
place tube. Sea water acts as a cooling medium to con-
trol the temperature inside the pressure cylinder, so as to
prevent the temperature of the sample from rising and
causing damage to the sample. The HRC and FPC retain
temperature by means of rapid freezing. The pressure
and temperature-retaining gravity piston sampler devel-
oped by Marine College of Zhejiang University [52] and
the HBFC designed by Beijing Institute of Exploration
Engineering use a vacuum in the middle of an interlayer,
an insulation coating sprayed on the inner surface of the
sampling tube, and a ceramic material, such as ZrO2/
CaO, sprayed on the external surface the sampling tube.
The PRMSC maintains the temperature of a sample by
heating the sampling tube in a water bath.

In addition, the use of an organic glass tube with a good
temperature-retaining performance as a core liner can
also better maintain the temperature of a core sample; an
insulation material can be filled between the core liner
and fidelity sampling cylinder. For example, the MAC
and DAPC pressure cylinders use glass-reinforced plas-
tic, which can not only maintain the temperature, but can
also absorb radial deformations caused by pressure dif-
ferences between the inside and outside of the pressure
cylinder.

3.3.2 Active Temperature-Retaining Techniques (ATRT)

ATRTs employ temperature-retaining measures such as
a thermoelectric refrigeration technique or liquid ammo-
nia technique to maintain the temperature of the sam-
pling tube or pressure cylinder, such that the purpose
of retaining the temperature of the sample is achieved.
The thermoelectric refrigeration technique, also known
as semiconductor refrigeration or thermoelectric cool-
ing, uses a theory of semiconductor refrigeration. A
deep-sea refrigeration structure is generally installed
inside the sampler, and the power supply is waterproofed.
The entire device is a three-layer tubular structure: the
innermost layer uses a copper tube as a cooling area; the

Page 11 of 17

middle is a thermal insulation layer filled with a heat-
insulating material; and the outermost is an aluminum
layer for heat dissipation [53].

Japan’s PTCS achieves an active temperature-retaining
function by using adiabatic and thermoelectric inner tube
cooling; it is actively cooled with a slurry cooling device
and low-temperature slurry during the sampling process.
The temperature of the core sample can be cooled to 5 °C
or lower, essentially the in-situ temperature of the deep
sea at depths over 6000 m. As a solid-state active cooling
method, thermoelectric refrigeration has the advantages
of no moving parts, no noise, easy integration, and the
ability to directly and precisely control the temperature
by adjusting the input voltage and electric current. It has
attracted significant attention in the field of temperature-
retaining design for marine samplers [54] (Figure 13).

A schematic of an HBFC from Jilin University is shown
in Figure 14; it uses dry ice as a cooling source, and alco-
hol as a cooling catalyst and cooling medium [55, 56].
When the sampler stops working, it throws a steel ball
into the drill pipe, to circulate the mud again. The func-
tion of the steel ball is to block the normal circulation
channel of the mud. Thus, the mud pressure increases,
pushing the steel ball and valve seat down to open the

diversion port of the outer pipe joint. The mud is guided
downward and pushes the control piston and alcohol
upper chamber piston down. The alcohol, which passes
through the dry ice chamber, is cooled into low-temper-
ature alcohol that is pressed into the freezing chamber,
freezing the drilled core. Thus, the core at the bottom of
the hole is temperature-retained.

At present, temperature-retaining techniques are
widely used in samplers for natural gas hydrate, but are
not very common in seabed sediment samplers. The vast
majority of sediment samplers do not use active temper-
ature-retaining measures, but rather use rapid icing or
liquid nitrogen freezing to maintain the temperature of
sediment samples.

3.4 Low-disturbance Sampling Technique

When sampling in the deep sea, the interaction between
the sampler and sediment often causes bending deforma-
tions and compression of the original layer of the sedi-
ment, destroying the integrity of the sample information
[58]. To obtain as complete a sediment sample as possi-
ble, various types of sediment samplers employ a series of
low-disturbance technical measures.

3.4.1 Sampling Device

The sampling device adopts a double-layered or multi-
layered tube structure. When a softer sediment sample
is taken, the inner layer of the sampling tube is in con-
tact with the sediment; when a harder sample sediment is
taken, the outer tube with the sampling drill bit employs a
certain gap in the radial direction with the sampling tube,
to thereby prevent disturbance of the inner layer sample
by the sampling drill bit. For example, the PCB adopts a
double-layered tube structure: the inner tube is a rotat-
ing sampling tube, and the lower end of the outer tube is
connected with a sampling drill bit. A gap is left between
the outer tube and sampling tube, to ensure minimal dis-
turbance to the sediment as the drill bit is drilled. The
PCS, HYACE-HRC, FPC, Hybrid PCS, and “Hainiu”
deep-sea sampling drill rigs all adopt this structure. For
the materials of the sampling tube, organic glass tubes
or materials with a small friction coefficient are recom-
mended, so asto lower the friction with the sample and
reduce disturbance to the sample. The diameter and ratio
of the inside and outside diameter of the sampling tube
should be optimized, and pile effects caused by geologi-
cal condition sand mechanisms of bending problems of
the sampling tube should be fully considered. ‘The critical
conditions should be determined, to thereby control the
plastic deformation area of the samples and reduce dis-
turbances there to.

Page 12 of 17

3.4.2 Sampling Cutter Head

The cutter head adopts a special cutter head design such
as a small inclination angle, small area ratio, small inner
diameter ratio, small outer diameter ratio, and/or thin
wall cylinder in front of the cutter head to reduce distur-
bances to the sample. Gravity-type and gravity-piston-
type samplers adopt this cutter head structure.

3.4.3 Core Catcher

The soft core catcher is set at the lower end of the sam-
pling cylinder. At the beginning of sampling, the petals
naturally expand under the pressure of the sediment sam-
ple, and the sediment enters the sampling cylinder when
the boundary disturbance is minimal. After sampling, the
petals are closed under the action of gravity, to prevent
the loss of sediment samples and reduce disturbances to
the sediment.

3.4.4 Piston Structure

For a columnar sampler without a piston structure, the
obtained sediment sample is often disturbed or short-
ened, due to the combination of the self-weight of the
sediment, friction between the sampling tube and sedi-
ment, the sampling speed, and the like. Accordingly, a
suction piston structure is placed inside the sampling
tube to reduce or eliminate the friction between the sam-
pling tube wall and sample, and the influence of the sam-
ple weight. The PTPC, MAC, and DAPC sample tubes
all adopt this piston structure. The piston remains at the
mud-water interface at the very beginning of sampling
and moves up as the sampling goes on, offsetting the neg-
ative pressure due to hydrostatic pressure, and thereby
obtaining the lowest-disturbance samples.

3.4.5 Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA)

In vibrating and rotary samplers, the sampling tube drills
often use a combined structure to obtain low-disturbance
sediment samples. The sampling cylinder comprises a
drill core, and an inner and outer sampling cylinder. The
outer cylinder is connected with the sampling drill, and
the inner cylinder is a non-rotating sampling tube. The
PCS, PTCS, Hybrid PCS, and APC all adopt this struc-
ture for the bottom hole assembly. For example, the
extended core barrel sampler has a portion that exceeds
the front end of the drill bit, and can collect soft sedi-
ment from the surface layer before the drill bit enters the
sediment. The sampler can be retracted into the drill pipe
when it contacts the hard sediment and continue to col-
lect deeper sediments under the rotation of the drill bit,
thereby reducing the disturbance to the sample.
He et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:66

3.5 Transfer Technique

Submarine sediment exists in a high-pressure environ-
ment. Barophilic microorganisms cannot survive at lower
pressures. At present, the pressure-retaining technique
is relatively mature, and can maintain the in-situ pres-
sure of the sediment and transfer the sediment to the sea
surface without any pressure drop [59]. However, there
are few studies regarding how ensure that the sediment
samples transferred to the sea surface are subsequently
transferred to the laboratory without pressure drops
and disturbances, for further analysis. The non-pres-
sure-drop transfer techniques mainly include the rapid
cooling technique of a pressure-retaining sampler deck,
rapid sample-transfer technique, sub-sample segmenta-
tion technique, multi-parameter pressure-retaining sam-
ple core scanning technique, and in-situ data recording
[59-61].

In recent years, the multi-sensor core logger developed
by Geotek in the UK has been able to manage sediment
samples up to 2 m in length and 150 mm in diameter.
The data of the sediment samples are directly analyzed by
sensors, such as those for density, P-wave velocity, resis-
tivity, magnetic susceptibility, X-ray fluorescence, linear
scanning imaging, and infrared spectroscopy [62, 63]
(Figure 15).

The pressure-retaining core analysis and transfer sys-
tem (PCATS) developed by Geotek [64—66] can cut high-
pressure long-columnar sediment into sub-samples with
a minimum length of 50 mm. At present, both the HRC
and FPC can be perfectly interfaced with the PCATS, to
transfer samples to a laboratory's pressure chamber for
fidelity analysis.

The Mini-PCATS is a small, simplified version of the
PCATS [67] that is compatible with all pressure-retain-
ing core storage chambers, in addition to other third-
party equipment designed with standard Geotek flange
clamps. A core section up to 1.2 m can be removed from

the storage chamber and accurately cut into sub-samples.
These sub-samples can be transferred to a sample test
unit (including a KO permeameter) where the physical
property parameters are measured, while maintaining
pressures up to 35 MPa (Figure 16).

Zhejiang University has developed a natural gas
hydrate pressure-retaining transfer system [68] includ-
ing a mechanical device for continuous sample transfer,
e.g., sample grabbing, sample pushing, sample cutting,
sample encapsulation, and small sample transfer. Sam-
ple cores of any length can be divided and stored under
the in-situ pressure and temperature. Under 20 MPa, the
internal pressure change during the sample transfer is
less than 20%. The system is equipped with two types of
cylinders. The inner diameter of the large sample transfer
cylinder is 750 mm, and is capable of obtaining a sam-
ple with a length of 500 mm. The inner diameter of the
sample transfer cylinder is 20 mm, and the sample length
is 200 mm. An online sonic wave detection function is
available for the core. The maximum detectable diameter
of the core is 67 mm, and the sonic measurement accu-
racy is 0.1 ms.

4 Conclusions and Prospects

A seabed sediment sampler is an indispensable sam-
pling equipment for marine resource exploration, marine
geological surveying, and marine scientific investiga-
tion. With the exploration of seabed resources expand-
ing to deeper and wider sea areas, deep-sea sampling
equipment will tend to require diversified structures,
integrated functions, intelligent operation, and the abil-
ity to obtain high-fidelity samples. The key technologies
of seabed sediment samplers will also be continuously

improved and perfected, so as to obtain more authen-
tic and reliable samples to meet the ever-increasing
demands on sampling. Facing a harsh environment of
high pressures and low temperatures in the deep sea,
many scientific challenges will be met by such deep-sea
sampling equipment, such as sampling mechanisms for
different sea areas, different depths, and different sedi-
ment characteristics, obtaining high-fidelity undisturbed
sediment samples under high-pressure and low-temper-
ature environments, and performing low-disturbance
sediment transfers without pressure drops. Based on this,
the prospects in sampling technology are discussed from
the following four perspectives.

4.1 Structural Diversity

The deep-sea sediment samplers designed by various
countries have many common points in regards to the
structures for sealing, pressure and temperature-retain-
ing, and low disturbances, and they show rich diversity,
owing to different national backgrounds and design
concepts. For the sealing and pressure-retaining struc-
ture, most of the current samplers use ball valves, flaps,
pistons, etc. Although the above-mentioned sealing
structures are reliable, there are still many challenges in
the harsh environment of the deep sea. The sealing and
pressure-retaining structures of the samplers will be fur-
ther studied. There will be new types of structures simi-
lar to the ice seal, which can achieve efficient sealing and
pressure retention for deep sea samples. In terms of the
structure for temperature-retaining, new materials for
deep-sea insulation will be studied and applied. In addi-
tion, precise control of the temperature of the sampler is
also an important research direction for in-situ sampling
in the future. In regards tol ow-disturbance structures,
owing to developments in marine equipment communi-
cation technology and electronic technology, sediment
samplers are undergoing structural improvements and
functional expansion, such as including sonic drilling and
energy impact drilling sampling in Germany, Canada,
and Japan. This is also a trend of future development.

4.2 Functional Integration

Integration denotes the deep-sea samplers possessing
not a single function, but an integration of multiple func-
tions. For example, Germany’s MAC and DAPC not only
provide high-fidelity sampling, but also have a function
for maintaining a low temperature, and a technique for a
computerized tomography scan of the sample.

Australia’s “PROD” drilling rig can not only conduct
core sampling in hard rock, but can also provide press-
in coring, seabed cone penetration testing (CPT) meas-
urements, and natural gas hydrate analysis in submarine
fields. Germany’s new type of MDP can obtain both hard

Page 14 of 17

rock and sediment cores, and in-situ detection capabil-
ity for some holes is also available. The US “ROVDRILL’
drilling machine can perform rotating hard rock cor-
ing, press-in sediment coring, and CPT operation. The
deep-sea rock corers can also be combined with the ROV
(Remote Operated Vehicle), which uses ROV control
to conveniently integrate various sampling devices and
tools. Such deep-sea rock corers can greatly save the time
and cost consumed by marine resource surveys. China’s
“Hainiu” sampling rig adopts a rope coring method, and
is able to core soft mud and hard rock. It is equipped with
a multi-functional in-situ test instrument for conduct-
ing in-situ tests on the end resistance, friction force, pore
water pressure, and temperature of the stratum. It is also
capable of filming the soil particles. It can be predicted
that these key techniques will be fully demonstrated in
future seabed sediment samplers which will no longer be
merely single-functional, but rather multi-functional, ie.,
performing detection, pressure and temperature retain-
ing, and transfers with no pressure drop.

4.3 Operational Intelligence

Intelligentization is an important research direction for
the future sampling of seabed sediment. Its main mani-
festation is in monitoring and control. Monitoring means
the ability to monitor a deep-sea sampling process, e.g.,
by equipping with a GPS positioning system and camera.
In the face of high pressure, low or high temperatures,
low organic matter content, darkness, etc. in the deep sea
environment, researchers can obtain real-time and accu-
rate information regarding the position, power, sampling
speed, and sampling resistance of samplers, and related
records of the sampling conditions on the operating plat-
form. This can provide abasis for the next operation and/
or emergency decision. Control means controlling the
further actions of the sampling, including start-stop con-
trol, speed control, position control, and frequency con-
trol, based on the monitoring of relevant data.

By real-time monitoring and control of the operation
of a deep-sea sediment sampler, the processes of div-
ing, landing, sampling, and recovery can be visualized
and controlled. Intelligentization can not only enhance
the deep-sea sediment sampler’s ability to adapt to com-
plex and variable geological environments in the deep
sea, but can also greatly improve the working efficiency
of the deep-sea sediment sampler, shorten the work-
ing time, and reduce the sampling cost. Simultaneously,
with the diversification of deep-sea sediment samplers,
additional devices and equipment must be equipped, and
those devices and equipment must work together. The
entire sediment sampler must be intelligently controlled
to achieve coordinated and efficient operation.

4.4 High Fidelity of the Sample

Fidelity sampling means undisturbed sampling (actually
low-disturbance) and temperature-and pressure-retain-
ing sampling. With the deepening exploration of seabed
resources and seabed biogeochemical cycles, whether
or not high-fidelity sediment samples can be obtained
for scientific research has become an important indica-
tor for measuring the performance of deep sea sampling
equipment. Different sampling equipment, owing to their
different structures, functions, and principles, will inevi-
tably cause changes in the in-situ characteristics of the
sampled samples, such as changes in the temperature,
pressure, stratification properties, chemical gradients,
oxidation state of the variable ions, and decomposi-
tion of the organic components. Among them, changes
in pressure will directly lead to the death of barophilic
microorganisms. Therefore, the development of low-
disturbance, high pressure-and temperature-retaining
deep-sea sediment samplers better satisfying the require-
mentsf or the exploration and development of deep-sea
resources, deep-sea biogeochemical cycles, and marine
basic science research will certainly become an impor-
tant development direction of seabed resource sampling
technology.
