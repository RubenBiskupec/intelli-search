Engineering, Inner Mongolia APTEEN is a typical routing protocol for wireless sensor networks, but when

University, Hohhot 010021, China clustering, cluster heads are randomly selected, which makes it easy to select nodes
with low residual energy as cluster heads, thus forming network holes. At the same
time, in multi hop transmission, the cluster head near the sink node is overloaded
due to forwarding a large amount of data. Aiming at these problems, this paper
introduces PSO algorithm and proposes ADCH-EPE-APTEEN routing protocol. In order
to make the particle swarm optimization algorithm more suitable for routing
protocol, this paper first proposes DCA-PSO based on particle swarm optimization
algorithm. DCA-PSO uses the classification adaptive change inertia weight for
different states of particles in the optimization process. At the same time, dynamic
learning factor is used to improve the influence of particle experience and other
particle experience on convergence speed and to improve the optimization accuracy
and speed of the algorithm. Secondly, when APTEEN routing protocol is networked,
the cluster head is selected by DCA-PSO, in which the residual energy of nodes, the
location of nodes, and the energy distribution around nodes are fully taken into
consideration. Thirdly, considering the distance between nodes and the sink node,
the residual energy and the energy distribution around nodes, a front area is set up
in the cluster located in the upper half and the assistant cluster head is selected in
the front area through the DCA-PSO algorithm. The simulation results show that the
DCA-PSO algorithm can significantly improve the search speed and precision
compared with the PSO algorithm. Compared with APTEEN routing protocol, the
ADCH-EPE-APTEEN routing protocol can reduce the network energy consumption
rate and extend network lifetime by 173%.

1 Introduction

Clustering routing protocol has the advantages of convenient topology manage-
ment, high energy utilization, and beneficial to data fusion and transmission pro-
cessing. Adaptive Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient Sensor Network Protocol
(APTEEN) is a typical clustering routing protocol, and it defines two thresholds,
hard threshold and soft threshold, which respectively specify the range of measured
values and the amount of change of the two measured values before and after. The
use of two thresholds can reduce both unnecessary and repeated data transfers.
APTEEN, which adopts the idea of clustering and data fusion, has high routing ef-
ficiency. It can collect data periodically and react quickly to emergencies [1, 2].
APTEEN is often used in the environment for monitoring, and Devadevan and
Suresh use APTEEN to monitor forest fires [3]. Literature [2] uses the APTEEN
routing protocol to monitor the temperature, humidity, and moisture of the land
and uses sensor nodes to periodically monitor these indicators.

The APTEEN routing protocol is improved by the LEACH routing protocol. The
protocol uses LEACH’s original clustering mode and cluster head selection. In the clus-
ter formation stage, all nodes are divided according to clusters, and each node ran-
domly generates a number between [0, 1]; if less than the threshold T(z), the node is
selected as the cluster head.

However, the APTEEN protocol does not consider the energy and position of the se-
lected nodes when selecting the cluster heads in the cluster. It may choose the nodes
with lower energy in the cluster as the cluster heads, thus causing the nodes to die too
fast, generating energy holes, and directly affecting the entire network lifetime.

In view of the above shortcomings, the APTEEN has been improved a lot at
home and abroad. Many protocols optimize the cluster heads’ selection method for
APTEEN, mainly to limit cluster heads’ selection in terms of energy and location,
so as to select the optimal cluster heads to improve the performance of the whole
network and reduce the energy consumption of the whole network. Literature [4
proposes that proper selection of cluster head probability can improve the effect-
iveness of clustering and optimize network performance. Literature [5] proposes
that cluster heads can be dynamically selected by setting threshold energy, so as to
extend network life. Literature [6] proposes an EDD-APTEEN routing protocol
which is improved cluster heads’ selection based on energy and location factors.
However, failing to take enough factors into consideration in the selection may
lead to the possibility of not choosing excellent nodes as cluster heads, and unable
to balance the energy consumption between clusters, leading to premature death
nodes. In this paper, ADCH-EPE-APTEEN (Area double cluster head-Energy pos-
ition equalization-Adaptive Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient Sensor Network
Protocol) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of unreasonable cluster head
selection and uneven energy consumption. The DCA-PSO (Dynamic Classification
Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm is used to select the optimal
intra-cluster through three conditions: the residual energy of nodes, the location of
nodes, and the energy distribution around nodes. The node is elected as the cluster
head, which slows down the node death rate and prolongs the network lifetime.
And the assistant cluster head is elected through DCA-PSO algorithm to ease the
cluster head energy consumption.

2 Particle swarm optimization and wireless communication model

2.1 Particle swarm optimization

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) [7-9] is a population based on_ intelligent
optimization algorithm proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy. The proposed algorithm
originates from the observation of birds’ foraging behavior. When birds forage in the
air, they do not know the specific location of food at first, but birds can always change
their flight direction by sharing information among individuals, so they can get closer
to the right food location and finally find food. The advantage of the PSO algorithm is
that it is simple and easy to implement [10]. At present, it is widely used in various
fields such as function optimization.

When using PSO algorithm to optimize the practical problem, the bird is abstracted
as a particle, and the solution of the optimization problem corresponds to the location
of the particle in the search space [11]. In the algorithm, the particle needs to calculate
its own fitness function value according to the fitness function, in order to judge the
pros and cons of its current position. The flight speed and position of the particle are
represented by vectors, and the particle updates its own motion formula and position
by updating the following two extreme values. One is the current individual optimal
value gbest, which represents the optimal position found by the particle itself. The other
is the collective optimal value pbest, which represents the best location for the entire
particle population to find. The update formula for particle position and velocity is
shown in Eqs. (1) and (2).

vn — wis + cr] (v5 _ x) + CoP (v5 _ xs) (2)

where vj; is the velocity vector of particle i in j-dimensional space, and its value range is
[Vmin» Vmax], xj is the position vector of particle i in j-dimensional space, p; is the indi-
vidual optimal value of particle i, and pg; is the collective optimal of all particles. Values
r; and ry are random numbers from [0, 1]. c; and cy» are learning factors. w is inertia
weight coefficient. The value of w is related to the influence of the particle’s historical
value on the current value. When the value of inertia weight coefficient w is large, it
can enhance the overall search ability of particles. When the value of inertia coefficient

w is small, it can enhance the local search ability of particles [12].

2.2 Wireless communication model

The wireless communication model commonly used in wireless sensor networks is
shown in Fig. 1 [13]. The energy consumption of the transmitter node is mainly com-
posed of two parts: the transmitting circuit and the power amplifier. The energy re-

quired to transmit the k-bit data is:

Erx(k,d) = Eetec X k + x k x d’d < do (3)
Ety(k,d) = Eetec X k + €amp X k x d‘d>do

3 Dynamic Classification Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (DCA-PSO)

In particle swarm optimization, the inertia weight is fixed, which means that the accel-
eration coefficients of each particle are the same, so it is impossible to further adjust
the running speed of the algorithm and the accuracy of the optimal solution. For parti-
cles with higher fitness values, the locality should be emphasized, and the fitness func-
tion value should be smaller. For particles with lower fitness values, the global value
should be emphasized, and the fitness function value should be larger. Therefore, this
paper introduces an adaptive change function based on the original particle swarm
optimization algorithm and adjusts the inertia weight value to:

f (i) — fF mnin Nec
wk) = 4 rin tr Wo) fil Lon )
Wmax fi) > F avg

where Wax denotes the maximum inertia weight, wi, denotes the minimum inertia
weight, f(i) denotes the current fitness function value of each particle, fii, denotes the
minimum fitness function value in the population, and f,,, denotes the average value of
the current fitness function in the whole population.

The values of learning factors c; and cz determine the self and social-cognitive abil-
ities of individual particles in the algorithm. If the c; value is too large, it will cause too
many particles to stay near the local area; if the cy value is too large, it will cause the
particles to reach the local optimum value ahead of time and converge to this value.
The algorithm should have a larger c; value and a smaller cz value in the initial stage,
so as to enhance the self-recognition ability of the particles, which is conducive to en-
hancing the global search ability of the algorithm in the initial stage of operation. In
the later stage, there should be smaller c, and larger c values, so that more particles
can learn from the global optimum, which is conducive to strengthening the ability of
local fine search in the later stage of the algorithm. Therefore, the values of learning
factors A and B are adjusted as shown in formulas (10) and (11):

c1(k) = ciini — (Ciini - Cryin) X (K/T max) (10)
co(k) = Coini + (cofin - C2ini) x (k/T max) (11)

where Cj; and cyf,, represent the starting and final values of accelerator c;. C9j,; and
Cofn Yepresent the starting and final values of accelerator cz. k represents the number of
current iterations; Tiyax represents the maximum number of iterations.

By substituting formula (9), formula (10), and formula (11) into formula (2), a new
speed updating formula can be obtained:

yr — w(k)vj + ¢1(k)ry (v5 _ x) + co(k)ro (vf _ xs) (12)
The specific steps of DCA-PSO are shown in Fig. 2.

4 Particle Swarm Optimization Cluster Head Selection Algorithm
It is assumed that N static nodes whose initial energy is EO are randomly distributed in
the M x M region. At the same time, it is assumed that the wireless sensor network

built by the group has the following characteristics:

(1) All nodes have unique IDs and are randomly distributed in the monitoring area.

(2) Each node can locate its own coordinate position.

(3) All nodes are fixed and energy is limited, base station is fixed, but energy is not
limited.

(4) All nodes can obtain their own residual energy, and the communication power can
be adjusted. The node can adjust the transmission power according to the distance.

The sensor nodes in this paper can be divided into two types: common node and
cluster head node. The cluster head node can communicate with a cluster head node

that is within its communication range and closer than the base station, but the next

hop can only be one of the nodes. The sensor node can also communicate with cluster
head nodes in its communication range, and the sensor node can belong to any cluster
head node in its communication range. Sensor nodes have a list of cluster head
nodes, but each sensor node can only specify one of them. Data acquisition and
transmission work adopts recycling mechanism. In each round, all sensor nodes
collect local data and send it to the corresponding cluster head node. Once the
cluster head node receives the data, it will fuse the data, discard redundant and ir-
relevant data, and send the fused data directly or through other cluster head nodes
to the base station.

4.1 Pre-clustered
In a wireless sensor network, the energy consumption of the entire sensor network in

each round is shown in Eq. (13).
4. M?
Eau < NE cluster =k (2NE + Epa + NEmp rors + Neg -) (13)

The total energy consumption in the network is a function related to the number of
cluster heads n, and the optimal number of cluster heads can make the network life
cycle longer. In the initial stage of the network, the base station collects energy and co-
ordinates information of all nodes and calculates the optimal number of cluster heads

in the network kop according to formula (14).

Then, based on the collected energy information, the base station calculates the aver-
age energy remaining £,,, in the network according to formula (15), selects ko, node

4.2 Optimize cluster head selection

After the pre-clustered phase, the cluster head is adjusted by considering the energy,
position, and energy balance of each node. This paper reduces the computational com-
plexity by introducing the DCA-PSO algorithm.

In order to make the DCA-PSO algorithm suitable for optimizing the cluster heads’
selection problem, the formula (1) and the formula (12) need to be adjusted. Since the
distribution of nodes can be imagined as a plane space, we need to split the velocity
and position vectors into components in both the x-axis and the y-axis. Formula (1)

and Formula (12) are split into:

k+1 _ yk | yk+1

yee — w(k)vi, + c(k)ry CG - xf, + e9(k)ro (vf, - xs, )

In order to avoid the particle search range beyond the desired region during the itera-
tive process, this paper adds restrictions on the speed and position of the DCA-PSO al-
gorithm. The specific conditions are as follows:

of particles on the x-axis and y-axis respectively; Xinmins Xiyminy Xixmaxy ANA Xjymax Tepre-
sent the minimum and maximum positions of particles on the x-axis and y-axis
respectively.

Since the network nodes are discretely divided in the wireless sensor network, the
particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed for continuous problems. The values
calculated by the nodes according to formula (17) cannot be mapped to the corre-
sponding network nodes one by one, so need to adjust the position obtained by the al-
gorithm, so that the adjusted Xj,.€{Py P2.5..PrdMiyEtPry,Pry+Pry}- Pix is the x-axis
component of the i-th node in the cluster, and P;, is the y-axis component of the i-th
node in the cluster. Order AP, = | xix — Pix |, APiy = |Xiy — Pjy|, APjx represents the ab-
solute value of the difference between x;, and the x component of node j in the cluster,
and AP,, represents the absolute value of the difference between x;, and the y compo-
nent of node j in the cluster. Let AP, = min{AP,, AP3,...,AP,,}. It indicates that the pos-
ition of the k-th node in the network is the closest to the distance of x; so adjust x; ~
Prxs Xiy ~ Py, that is, the point of the search is located at the position of the node k.

The fitness function is an important indicator when the DCA-PSO algorithm selects
the optimal value. In order to solve the problem of uneven energy consumption be-
tween cluster heads and common nodes in APTEEN protocol, this paper mainly sets
up fitness functions in three aspects: (1) residual energy of nodes, (2) average distance
within clusters, and (3) the energy distribution around nodes.

In the network, because the cluster head needs to forward the information of each
node, it consumes a lot of energy. Therefore, the amount of remaining energy is an im-

portant factor in the selection of cluster heads.

The energy consumption of sending messages is proportional to the transmission dis-
tance. In order to reduce the energy consumption of the entire network, the position of
the cluster head in the cluster should be close to the geometric center of the entire
cluster. R(j) is the distance from node j to node i.

The energy distribution around nodes is an important condition for measuring the
energy distribution of selected cluster heads and surrounding nodes. The higher the
node distribution around nodes of the selected cluster head, the more balanced the en-
ergy distribution in the network, and the life cycle of the network can be maximized.

fs Ws RU) +1 25)
Based on the above three influencing factors, the fitness function modeled in this

paper is as follows:

fi) = af + Bfy +o (26)
Ss

where a, b, and c are the weights of the fitness function impact factor, the value range

is [0, 1], anda + b+ c = 1. By adjusting the weight value, the performance of the algo-

rithm can be emphasized. The smaller a value can make the network more effective to

avoid the network void, a smaller b value can make the cluster more compact, and a

smaller c can make the network energy distribution more uniform. As long as the value

of f{i) is smaller, the overall life of the network will be longer.

4.3 Select assistant cluster head
In multi hop transmission, the cluster head near the sink node is overloaded due to for-
warding a large amount of data. It is necessary that reducing the energy consumption
of the cluster head near the sink node and avoiding the energy waste caused by the
nodes near the sink node returning the information to the cluster head is necessary.
After the selection of the main cluster head in the cluster is completed, a front area is
set in the cluster located in the upper half of the monitoring area, and an assistant clus-
ter head is elected again in the front area.

The front area is shown in Fig. 3. In the figure, the sink node is the base station, node
i is the cluster head, and node j is the node farthest from cluster head i within the clus-
ter. Make circle 1 with i as the center, d (i, j) as the radius, and circle 2 with sink as the
center and d (i, sink) as the radius. The intersection of circle 1 and circle 2 is called the

front area of the cluster.

 

 

Fig. 3 Front area
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:155 Page 10 of 16

As shown in Fig. 4, according to the distance between the cluster head and the sink
node, the data transmission mode of the nodes in the front area can be divided into
two situations. If d (i,j) < d (i,sink), the nodes within the front area is transmitted date
to the assistant cluster head. If d (i,j) > d (i,sink), then the nodes within the front area
directly transmit the date to the sink node to alleviate the energy consumption of the
cluster head.

In order to alleviate the energy consumption of cluster heads and reduce the energy
waste caused by the nodes near the sink node returning the information to the cluster
head. This paper sets the fitness function in three aspects when selecting assistant clus-
ter heads: (1) residual energy of nodes, (2) distance between nodes and sink node, and
(3) the energy distribution around nodes.

The front area is close to the sink node, and the assistant cluster heads are mainly
used to alleviate the energy consumption of cluster heads and reduce the unnecessary
energy waste caused by information return. Therefore, when selecting the assistant
cluster head, the distance between the assistant cluster head and the sink node is very

important.

sistant cluster head is as follows:

smaller, the effect of cluster head is better, the overall life of the network will be longer.

The data transmission diagram of ADCH-EPE-APTEEN is shown in Fig. 5.

The specific process of ADCH-EPE-APTEEN algorithm is shown in Fig. 6.

5 Simulation and analysis

In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm is
tested and simulated on the Matlab simulation platform. The experimental scenario
is that 100 nodes are randomly distributed in the region of 100m x 100m, the ini-
tial energy of the node is Ey = 0.1J, the base station coordinates are at (50,50),
and the data fusion degree is 60%. When transmitting and receiving data, only the
energy consumption of data transmitted and received is considered, Among them,

er; = 0.0013 pJ/(bit/m?), Emp = 10 pjJ/(bit/m*), receiving or transmitting 1 bit data
consumes energy is Egje. = 50 nJ/bit.

Under the same population size, the randomization process of PSO algorithm
and DCA-PSO algorithm to the same objective function is shown in Fig. 7. As
can be seen from the figure, the output of PSO algorithm is no longer signifi-
cantly changed at about 70 rounds, while that of DCA-PSO algorithm tends to
be stable at about 30 rounds, and the output of PSO algorithm is obviously infer-
ior to that of DCA-PSO algorithm due to falling into local optimal. This shows
that this algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed and enhance the search
ability.

In order to highlight the improvement of network in life cycle, in the simulation
model, APTEEN protocol is compared with the EDD-APTEEN protocol which is
improved cluster heads selection based on energy and location factors, and the
ADCH-EPE-APTEEN optimization protocol. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the first
dead node appeared in the original APTEEN clustering method in about 100
rounds, and all the nodes died in about 350 rounds. EDD-APTEEN algorithm has
the first dead node in 300 rounds and all the dead nodes in 600 rounds. The
ADCH-EPE-APTEEN algorithm showed the first dead node in 500 rounds, and all
died in about 1000 rounds. This shows that the algorithm can extend the lifetime
of the network.

As can be seen from Fig. 9, because the ADCH-EPE-APTEEN algorithm con-
siders the location problem and the energy distribution equilibrium problem when
the cluster heads are selected, the transmission energy consumption is significantly

reduced. And because algorithm elect the assistant cluster head to ease the cluster

6 Conclusions

Aiming at the problem of slow convergence speed and being easy to fall into
local optimum of particle swarm optimization, an improved DCA-PSO algo-
rithm is proposed. The algorithm proposes that the inertia weight and acceler-
ation factor be adaptively adjusted at the same time to enhance the global
search ability in the initial search stage and the local search ability in the later
search stage. The network simulation shows that DCA-PSO algorithm can sig-
nificantly improve the search speed and accuracy compared with PSO algorithm.
Meanwhile, aiming at the problem that APTEEN routing protocol is easy to se-
lect low-energy long-distance nodes in cluster head selection, and in multi hop
transmission, the cluster head near the sink node is overloaded due to forward-
ing a large amount of data, a new ADCH-EPE-APTEEN algorithm is proposed
in which the optimal number of cluster heads is added at the stage of cluster
head selection to control the proportion of selected cluster head nodes and the
DCA-PSO algorithm is introduced. Algorithm optimizes cluster head selection
through high energy and energy distribution balance between close distance and
surrounding nodes. And algorithm also set front area to ease the cluster head
energy consumption. Network simulation shows that the algorithm can signifi-
cantly prolong the survival time of the entire network; at the same time, it can
slow down the network energy consumption rate and improve the network en-

ergy utilization efficiency.

7 Results and discussion

7.1 DCA-PSO

The search accuracy of DCA-PSO is about 30% higher than that of PSO, and the con-
vergence speed is about 50%. It can be seen that the convergence speed and accuracy
of DCA-PSO are greatly improved than that of PSO, and the algorithm is more stable

and more suitable for cluster head optimization in wireless sensor networks.

7.2 ADCH-EPE-APTEEN

ADCH-EPE-APTEEN delays the time of node death, balances energy consumption,
and extends network lifetime further operating in the same settings compared with
APTEEN. The proposed algorithm has good scalability, and it is suitable for large-scale
network. The reason is that ADCH-EPE-APTEEN optimizes the cluster head selection,
and alleviates the energy consumption of cluster head near sink by means of double
cluster heads.

8 Methods

8.1 DCA-PSO

DCA-PSO adopts adaptively changing inertial weight coefficients, continuously changes
the inertial weight coefficients for particles at different positions, and adjusts the global
and local search capabilities of particles. At the same time, the algorithm adjusts the
fixed learning factor to a dynamically changing learning factor. The global search ability
of the algorithm is enhanced at the initial stage of operation and the ability of local fine
search is enhanced at the later stage.

8.2 ADCH-EPE-APTEEN

ADCH-EPE-APTEEN is the optimization of APTEEN. In order to prevent cluster head
nodes from dying prematurely and forming network holes, ADCH-EPE-APTEEN intro-
duced the DCA-PSO algorithm to optimize cluster head selection through three condi-
tions: the remaining energy of the node, the position of the node in the cluster, and the
energy distribution around the node. At the same time, in order to avoid the excessive
energy consumption of nodes close to sink, the algorithm sets a front area in the upper
half and selects the assistant cluster head to reduce the pressure of cluster head nodes.
Compared with APTEEN, the ADCH-EPE-APTEEN algorithm can significantly pro-
long the survival time of the entire network; at the same time, it can slow down the
network energy consumption rate and improve the network energy utilization
efficiency.
