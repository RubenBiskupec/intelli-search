Abstract

Landslides are the most destructive geological hazard in the hilly regions. For systematic landslide mitigation and
management, landslide evaluation and hazard zonation is required. Over the past few decades several techniques
have been developed that can be used for landslide evaluation and zonation. These techniques can broadly be
classified into qualitative and quantitative approaches. Qualitative approaches include geomorphological analysis
and heuristic techniques whereas quantitative approaches include statistical, artificial intelligence and deterministic
techniques. In quantitative techniques prediction for landslide susceptibility is based on the actual realistic data and
interpretations. Further, the quantitative techniques also overcome the subjectivity of qualitative approaches. Each
of these techniques may consider different causative factors and utilizes various means for factor evaluation and
analysis. When compared, each of these techniques has its own advantage and disadvantage over other
techniques. The selection of appropriate technique for landslide hazard evaluation and zonation is very crucial. The
factors that need to be considered to adopt an appropriate approach are; investigation purpose, the extent of the
area to be covered, the type of mapping units, the scale of map to be produced, type of data to be used, type of
landslides, availability of resources, capability and skill set of an evaluator and the accessibility to the study area. The
main aim of this article is to present a comprehensive review on various techniques and approaches available for
landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation mapping. Further, attempt is also made to assess the effectiveness of

these techniques in landslide hazard zonation studies.

Keywords: Landslide, Landslide susceptibility, Landslide evaluation, Landslide zonation

Introduction

Landslides are considered to be the most damaging geo-
logical hazard in mountainous regions (Mengistu et al.
2019; Hamza and Raghuvanshi 2017; Girma et al. 2015;
Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Pan et al. 2008; Kanungo et al.
2006; Crozier and Glade 2005; Dai et al. 2002; Parise
and Jibson 2000; Varnes 1996). In the landslide study
there are three basic components, these are landslide
susceptibility, landslide hazard and landslide risk. Land-
slide susceptibility mapping or zonation is the sub-
division of the terrain in to zones that have a different
likelihood for landslide occurrence. It includes spatial
distribution, size, location and displacement of the

landslide deposit (Fell et al. 2008; Guzzetti et al. 1999;
Varnes 1984). Landslide hazard mapping/zonation is a
division of terrain into zones that are basically character-
ized by the spatial and temporal probability of landslide
occurrence that includes description of location, volume,
and prediction of future landslide occurrence in an area
(Fell et al. 2008; Fell et al. 2007; AGS 2000).

In order to minimize the damage due to landslides it
is necessary to evaluate the factors that are responsible
for the landslides. These factors are related to geology,
geomorphology, landuse and landcover, rainfall, seismi-
city, manmade activities etc. (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a;
Anbalagan 1992). For landslide studies it is generally
assumed that the combination of these factors may pos-
sibly lead to landslides in a given area. Therefore, evalu-
ation of these factors and their relation with the past
landslides in an area may form the basis for the

prediction of future landslides (Chimidi et al. 2017;
Negassa and Kala 2015; Girma et al. 2015).

In order to evaluate and zone the area for potential
landslides, landslide hazard evaluation and zonation
techniques may be applied (Hamza and Raghuvanshi
2017; Girma et al. 2015; Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Bisson
et al. 2014; Pan et al. 2008; Anbalagan 1992). In past sev-
eral techniques have been developed by various re-
searchers that can broadly be classified into inventory
based approaches, expert evaluation (Raghuvanshi et al.
2014a; Guzzetti et al. 1999; Turrini and Visintainer
1998; Sarkar et al. 1995; Anbalagan 1992; Pachauri and
Pant 1992 etc.), statistical (Negassa and Kala 2015;
Girma et al. 2015; Kanungo et al. 2006; Dai and Lee
2001; Carrara et al. 1992 etc.), deterministic (Fall et al.
2006), probabilistic and distribution free approaches
(Kanungo et al. 2006). Several studies have attempted to
list and review the techniques those are applied for land-
slide susceptibility and hazard zonation (Lee 2015;
Thiebes et al. 2012; Michoud et al. 2012; Jaboyedoff
et al. 2012; Jongmans and Garambois 2007; Angeli et al.
2000; Turner and Schuster 1996, etc.). Each of these
techniques considers various factors and uses different
means for factor evaluation and analysis. When com-
pared, each of these techniques have its own characteris-
tics and may have certain advantage and disadvantage
over the other techniques (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Fall
et al. 2006; Kanungo et al. 2006; Casagli et al. 2004; Guz-
zetti et al. 1999; Leroi 1997). Further, some degree of
uncertainty always exists in these techniques owing to
factors that are considered or the methods that are
followed to generate the factor data (Negassa and Kala
2015; Carrara et al. 1995).

Further, these landslide hazard techniques can be ap-
plied at different scales depending on the area to be cov-
ered, the geological and geo-morphological factors to be
considered, the methods by which the concerned factor
data will be generated and the capability and skill set of
an evaluator (Ermias et al. 2017; Chimidi et al. 2017; Fall
et al. 2006; Kanungo et al. 2006; Casagli et al. 2004;
Guzzetti et al. 1999; Leroi 1997; Carrara et al. 1992).
The main objective of the present research work is to
present a comprehensive review on various techniques
and approaches that are available for landslide suscepti-
bility and hazard zonation mapping. Further, it is also
attempted to assess the effectiveness of these techniques
in landslide hazard zonation studies.

Data types and software for landslide studies

Data collected from the field visit and/or remote sensing
image analyses are the initial steps for landslide studies.
The technique, by which data pertaining to landslide
study is generated, primarily depends on the scale of the
study, purpose of the study and the accessibility to the

study area. The data that is needed for landslide suscep-
tibility and hazard zonation studies mainly includes data
on; landslide inventory, environmental and triggering
factors (Sreedevi and Yarrakula 2016; Metternicht et al.
2005; Soeters and Van Westen 1996). The environmen-
tal factors mainly consist of slope angle, slope aspect,
flow accumulation, lithology, geological structures/ prox-
imity to faults, soil type, soil depth/ thickness, slope hy-
drology, geomorphology, proximity to streams, road
cuts, land use types and changes etc. The triggering fac-
tors include daily rainfall, rainfall intensity/ duration,
earthquake and volcanic eruption. In general, it is not
possible to define a uniform list of such causal factors
that would be required for the landslide studies. The
selection of such causal factors may differ, depending on
the scale of analysis, the characteristics of the study area,
the landslide type, and on the failure mechanisms. The
main difference between the data collection for landslide
susceptibility and hazard zonation is in the collection of
landslide inventory data; for landslide hazard spatial and
temporal landslide data from archive, image analysis etc.
is required whereas for landslide susceptibility only
spatial data is sufficient. Further, based on the type of
the selected technique, the data listed above is chan-
ged either in to grid cell, terrain units, unique-
condition units, slope units or in to topographic units
(Reichenbach et al. 2018; Guzzetti et al. 1999).

The commonly used software for landslide studies are
ArcGIS package that is used for mapping landslide influ-
enced area, factor maps preparation, overlay analysis and
interpretations. Erdas Imagine is used for image process-
ing that allows processing for geospatial factor layers
used for landslide susceptibility and hazard studies. Fur-
ther, Geostudio, Geoslope’s and SLOPE/W are used for
geotechnical slope stability studies. Also, SPSS/real sta-
tistics and MS Excel are used for data management and
statistical analysis.

Methods of landslide susceptibility and hazard
zonation

In order to evaluate landslide susceptibility and hazard
zonation several approaches and techniques have been
proposed. These includes landslide inventories, heuristic
terrain and susceptibility zoning, statistical methods, de-
terministic methods, probabilistic methods etc. (Reich-
enbach et al. 2018; Corominas et al. 2014; Raghuvanshi
et al. 2014a; Negassa and Kala 2015; Kanungo et al.
2006; Aleotti and Chowdhury 1999; Guzzetti et al.
1999). Broadly, all these techniques or approaches may
be further classified into qualitative and quantitative
approaches (Fig. 1). The qualitative approaches include
distribution analysis or inventory, geomorphic analysis
and the expert (heuristic) evaluation techniques which
are based on the knowledge and experience of the

istical, deterministic, probabilistic and distribution free
techniques (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Kanungo et al.
2006). The qualitative approaches are considered to be
subjective in nature (Girma et al. 2015; Raghuvanshi
et al. 2014a; Kanungo et al. 2006; Fall et al. 2006; Casagli
et al. 2004) whereas quantitative approaches are consid-
ered to be objective in nature (Girma et al. 2015; Fall
et al. 2006). In recent times quantitative approaches have
been widely used for landslide susceptibility and hazard
evaluation.

Direct approaches

Geomorphic and landslide inventory techniques

The geomorphic techniques are the direct methods of
landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation mapping.
Most of the data pertaining to various factors respon-
sible for landslides are obtained through remote sensing
and the data procurement from direct field work is
rarely employed in these methods. The geomorphic
mapping of landslides susceptibility is carried out
through aerial photographs (Mandaglio et al. 2016;
Kanungo et al. 2009; Guzzetti et al. 1999; Verstappen
1983) or from satellite images (Nossin 1989). These
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

methods most commonly, but not necessarily are associ-
ated with the production of a landslide inventory map.

Landslide inventory includes mapping of the past land-
slides in the area. This method also includes collection
and recording of data on location, type and dimensions
of landslides. Beside, data/ information on responsible
causative factors, triggering mechanism and landslides
occurrence frequency is also collected (Girma et al.
2015; Fall et al. 2006; Dai et al. 2002; Dai and Lee 2001).
Landslide inventory mapping is considered to be straight
forward and is required for most of the susceptibility
and hazard zonation techniques (Dai and Lee 2002) ei-
ther to formulate the general rules for the hazard predic-
tion or to validate the predicted model. Generally, these
geomorphic techniques do not consider the factors that
have initiated or triggered the landslides. The principal
factors that are considered for landslide hazard zonation
are lithology, geomorphology, landuse and landcover
and presence or absence of landslides in the area.

Indirect approaches

Expert evaluation

These techniques are indirect method of landslide
evaluation and zonation. These techniques are based
on various causative factors that are selected by the
evaluator. In these techniques expert makes a decision
on the degree and type of hazard for the given area,
for which he may use either an indirect or a direct
mapping approach. The landslide hazard is evaluated
based on quasi-static variables (Fall et al. 2006; Dai
and Lee 2001) which are primarily based on the judg-
ment and experience of an evaluator (Girma et al.
2015; Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Fell et al. 2008;
Gorsevski et al. 2003; Guzzetti et al. 1999; Aleotti and
Chowdhury 1999; Van Westen et al. 1997; Soeters
and Van Westen 1996; Varnes and IAEG 1984;
Carrara et al. 1995; Hutchinson 1995). Since these
methods are based on the evaluation of an expert
therefore they are considered to be subjective in na-
ture (Girma et al. 2015; Ruff and Czurda 2008;
Kanungo et al. 2006; Fall et al. 2006; Casagli et al.
2004).

The landslide susceptibility and hazard evaluated by
heuristic technique for a given area may vary consider-
ably if evaluated by different experts. However, these
techniques are popular because of their simplicity in ap-
plication. These techniques are based on data, primarily
acquired from the field and are well supported by the
judgment and experience of an evaluator (Raghuvanshi
et al. 2014a, 2014b). Some examples of expert evaluation
techniques are; techniques proposed by Raghuvanshi
et al. (2014a), Ayenew and Barbieri (2005), Guzzetti
et al. (1999), Turrini and Visintainer (1998), Sarkar et al.
(1995), Anbalagan (1992), Pachauri and Pant (1992) etc.

Multi-criteria decision analysis methods

These methods are semi-quantitative approaches
which are mostly used for landslide susceptibility
evaluation (Abija et al. 2020; Erener et al. 2016;
Ahmed 2015; Feizizadeh et al. 2014; Kavzoglu et al.
2013; Feizizadeh and Blaschke 2012; Gorsevski and
Jankowski 2010) and hazard zonation studies (Bera
et al. 2019). The methods which are categorized
under multi-criteria decision analysis are analytical
hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy set based analysis,
weighted linear combination and ordered weighted
average (Bera et al. 2019; Ahmed 2015; Feizizadeh
and Blaschke, 2012). Recently to minimize the
subjectivity during factors weighting fuzzy linguistic
based approaches are also being used. Some afore-
mentioned subgroups of multi-criteria decision
methods are discussed in the following paragraphs.
These are AHP, the concept of fuzzy logic and
weighted overlay method.

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach The AHP
is a multi-criteria decision making approach which is
utilized to evaluate the landslide hazard susceptibility
and hazard zonation mapping. It is a systematic ap-
proach that involves problem definition, goals and alter-
natives determination, formulation of pair wise
comparison matrix, weight determination and finding an
overall priority (Pardeshi et al. 2013; Saaty 2008). Land-
slide is a complex process that is resulted by combin-
ation of various causative factors (Raghuvanshi, 2019;
Chimidi et al. 2017). The AHP approach can be applied
in absolute or a relative measurement of relationship be-
tween causative factors and landslides. In absolute meas-
urement each alternative is compared with one ideal
alternative whereas, in relative measurement each alter-
native is compared with many other alternatives. The
absolute measurement approach is normative that is
conditioned by what is known to be the best. In contrast,
the relative measurement approach is conditioned by the
experience and ability to judge observations by an evalu-
ator thus, it is descriptive in nature (Pardeshi et al. 2013;
Saaty and Vargas 2006; Saaty 2008). Each of the
landslide causative factors can be taken as alternatives.
Further, these causative factors are assigned with abso-
lute numbers (1-9) based on their relative significance
in inducing instability to the slope (Yagi 2003). Thus,
comparison matrices are developed to determine
Consistency Ratio (CR) and Consistency Index (CI)
(Pardeshi et al. 2013).

Weighted overlay method Weighted overlay method is
a simple and direct method that can be used for the
evaluation of landslide hazard in the given area (Ayele
et al. 2014; Erener and Duzgun 2012; Bachri and Shresta
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

2010; Intarawichian and Dasananda 2010). This method
is based on the assumption that the conditions that has
resulted into the past landslides if reoccur in future in
other areas, again landslides can occur. In weighted
overlay method, for each considered causative factor
layers, every cell is reclassified based on the preferred
scale as per the significance with respect to the contribu-
tion that particular factor class can have on landslide oc-
currence. Such preferred scale is generally taken from 1
to 9 with 9 being the most significant with respect to the
landslide occurrence. Thus, all causative factor layers are
combined in GIS environment by using Weighted Over-
lay Model equation (Eq. 1). Besides, respective weights
are also assigned to the causative factors on 0-9 ordinal
scale. The numeric numbers assigned to factor class are
termed as ratings and the numbers assigned to respect-
ive causative factors are known as weight (Kanungo
et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2004). The higher weight or rating
to a causative factor or to its respective class represents
its greater significance for landslide occurrence (Ayele
et al. 2014; Kanungo et al. 2006).

Fuzzy logic method The processes, events or function
that change continuously may possibly be un-defined
in terms of true or false events, thus these events or
activities are expressed in fuzzy manner. The things
which are vague or not clear are known as fuzzy. The
Fuzzy logic is considered to be a superset of Boolean
logic which is a extension to address partial truth
values that are completely false or completely true
(Lee 2007; Chacon et al. 2006; Gorsevski et al. 2003).
Fuzzy logic method is applied in landslide studies to
avoid subjectivity owing to selection of various mul-
tiple causative factors (Meten et al. 2015; Chacon
et al. 2006; Zadeh 1978). The Fuzzy logic method is
based on the fuzzy set theory in which membership
degrees of elements can have varying degrees of con-
fidence in an interval of [0, 1] (Ross 2010; Lee 2007;
Kanungo et al. 2006). There are various fuzzy opera-
tors that can be used, these are; ‘fuzzy or’, ‘fuzzy and’,
‘fuzzy algebraic product’, ‘fuzzy algebraic sum’ and
‘gamma operator’.

Among these, ‘fuzzy and’ has equivalence with ‘Bool-
ean AND’ (logical intersection) operation in values of
classical set (Razifard et al. 2018; Anbalagan et al. 2015;
Lee 2007) (Eq. 2).

Combination — MIN (U4; Ups Uc) (2)

Where ‘Ucombination is the fuzzy membership function,
‘Ua’ represents the membership value of map ‘A’ at spe-
cified location, and ‘up’ represents the value of map ‘B’
at specified location, likewise ‘uc’ and so on.

Similarly, the ‘fuzzy or’ is equivalent to ‘Boolean OR’
(logical union) that represents the values of output
membership, controlled by the maximum values for any
of the input maps. Thus, the ‘fuzzy or’ can be repre-
sented as (Lee 2007; Zimmermann 1996) (Eq. 3):

U-Combination — MAX (U4; Ups Uc) (3)

Further, the ‘fuzzy algebraic product’ operator can be
expressed as (Zimmermann 1996; Bonham-Carter 1994)
Eq.4;

n
Combination — | [4 (4)
i=1

Where; ‘1; represents the fuzzy membership function
for the ‘i’ map and ‘i’ represents 1, 2... n maps that are
to be combined.

Similarly, the ‘fuzzy algebraic sum’ compliments to
‘fuzzy algebraic product’ and is expressed as (Lee 2007;
Zimmermann 1996; Bonham-Carter 1994) (Eq. 5);

n
Combination — 1—- | [G-4) (5)
i=l

Where; ‘1; represents the fuzzy membership function
for the ‘i’ map and ‘i’ represents 1, 2... n maps that are
to be combined.

Finally, the ‘gamma operation’ can be expressed in
terms of the ‘fuzzy algebraic product’ and the ‘fuzzy alge-
braic sum’ as (Anbalagan et al. 2015; Zimmermann
1996; Bonham-Carter 1994) (Eq. 6)

yr

(6)

Where; ‘\’express a parameter that is chosen in the
range of (0,1), the fuzzy algebraic sum is calculated
through Eq. 5 and fuzzy algebraic product is calculated
by using Eq. 4.

When X is 1 in ‘fuzzy gamma operation’ the combin-
ation is identical to ‘fuzzy algebraic sum’ and when the
value of A is 0 the combination is identical to ‘fuzzy alge-
braic product’. Thus, sensible selection of ‘\’ may

provide values as output that will make sure flexible ne-
gotiations among decreasing trends in fuzzy algebraic
product and increasing tendencies in ‘fuzzy algebraic
sum’ (Lee 2007). For landslide susceptibility study Lee
(2007) and Ahmed et al. (2014) have assigned ‘X’ values
randomly in between 0 to 1; as 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, and 0.975.

Statistical approaches

Statistical approaches are the most commonly used
methods for landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation
(Mengistu et al. 2019; Hamza and Raghuvanshi 2017;
Girma et al. 2015; Kanungo et al. 2006). Reviews on vari-
ous methods developed in past and subsequent evalu-
ation and development of methods has been presented
by Reichenbach et al. (2018), Corominas et al. (2014)
and Fell et al. (2008). Some of the techniques, which
were developed earlier, have been discarded, some
methods were modified and new techniques are always
being developed (Ayalew and Yamagishi 2005). A thor-
ough literature review made during the present work re-
vealed that the statistical techniques that were used for
landslide susceptibility evaluation and zonation by previ-
ous researchers can be broadly classified into; Bivariate
and Multivariate statistical approaches (Kanungo et al.
2006; Gorsevski et al. 2006a, 2006b; Gorsevski et al.
2000).

Each of these statistical methods showed significant
heterogeneity in adopted thematic factors, selected scale,
statistical modeling tools used and the methods used for
the model performance evaluation and validation. In
terms of performance and validation some of these stat-
istical methods may produce better results; however no
individual method has proved to be perfect in its per-
formance. In fact integration of these methods into opti-
mal model by utilizing the same thematic factors data
and landslide inventory may ideally produce better re-
sults than a single model. It needs to be realized that the
capability, skill set and experience of an evaluator in ap-
plying a particular statistical model is more important
than the method by itself (Reichenbach et al. 2018;
Corominas et al. 2014). In general, for landslide suscepti-
bility evaluation and zonation approach through statis-
tical modeling as such no established standards and
code of practices are available. Thus, it is always a chal-
lenge in adopting an appropriate method for landslide
susceptibility evaluation. Further, uncertainty always ex-
ists on account of its credibility and the results thus pro-
duced by the adopted method (Reichenbach et al. 2018;
Guzzetti et al. 2006). General limitation of these statis-
tical methods is that they do not propose mechanisms
that control slope failure, but rather it assumes that the
prediction of future landslide areas can be assessed by
measuring the combinations of variables that have led to

Page 6 of 19

landslide occurrence in the past (Safaei et al. 2011; Lee
et al. 2004; Guzzetti et al. 1999).

Bivariate statistical approach The bivariate statistical
approach is based on an inductive logic, which suggests
that if a situation holds in all observed cases than the
situation holds in all cases. Thus, these techniques are
based on a general assumption that “past and the
present are the key for future” (Dai and Lee 2001). For
landslide studies it is generally assumed that the com-
bination of conditions pertaining to various causative
factors may possibly lead to landslide in a given area.
Therefore, evaluation of these factors and their relation
with the past landslides in the area may form the basis
for the prediction of potential areas where landslides
may occur in future (Chimidi et al. 2017; Negassa and
Kala 2015; Girma et al. 2015; Lan et al. 2004; Dai et al.
2002). In bivariate statistical techniques contribution of
individual causative factors in inducing landslide in an
area is evaluated separately. Such contribution of various
causative factors in inducing landslides is assessed quan-
titatively through density ratio. The density ratio is de-
rived through overlay analysis where each of the
causative factor layers is overlaid over landslide inven-
tory distribution layer. The overlay analysis will thus
provide a ratio between landslide that ‘did’ occur to the
landslide that “did not’ occur within each causative factor
class (Hamza and Raghuvanshi 2017; Dai and Lee 2001;
Lee and Min 2001). Further, combining these density ra-
tios for various factor classes will form the basis for
landslide hazard evaluation and zonation in the given
area. The commonly used methods for landslide suscep-
tibility and hazard zonation that fall under bivariate stat-
istical approach are; Frequency Analysis (likelihood
ratio) method (Lee and Min 2001), Weighted overlay
model (Ayele et al. 2014), Weights of Evidence Model
(Mohammady et al. 2012), Information Value Model
(IV) (Mengistu et al. 2019), Fuzzy logic method (Lee
2007; Chacon et al. 2006; Kanungo et al. 2006; Gorsevski
et al. 2003) etc.

(i) Frequency Analysis (likelihood ratio) method

Among the bivariate statistical approaches Frequency
analysis is the most commonly used method (Chimidi
et al. 2017; Hamza and Raghuvanshi 2017; Girma et al.
2015; Lee and Min 2001). This method utilizes the
correlation between each of the responsible causative
factor classes and the spatial distribution of past land-
slides in the area (Chimidi et al. 2017; Girma et al. 2015;
Moung-Jin et al. 2014; Akgun et al. 2012; Pradhan and
Lee 2009; Lee 2005). The frequency analysis method is
based on the ratio of landslides in a factor class as a per-
cent of landslides to the area of the factor class as a
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

percent to the entire area. This frequency ratio is nor-
malized to ‘1’. Thus, a frequency ratio for a parameter
class greater than one shows strong correlation to the
occurrence of landslide whereas a frequency ratio less
than one indicates lower correlation of the factor class
with the landslides (Chimidi et al. 2017; Girma et al.
2015; Lee and Min 2001). The frequency ratio (FRg) can
be expressed as (Eq. 7);

%Ls
%Am (7)

Where; ‘FR,’ is the Frequency ratio for the causative
factor class, “%Ls’ is the percentage of landslides in a
causative factor class and ‘%Am’ is the area of the causa-
tive factor class as a percentage of the entire map.

Further, the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) for
each pixel is the summation of total overlapped pixels
and is given by Eq. 8;

 

FRq =

LSI = S~ FR, (8)
d=1

If the LSI value is high the landslide hazard is consid-
ered to be high. The LSI can also be represented as land-
slide hazard index (LHI) (Pradhan and Lee 2009).

(ii) Weights of Evidence (WOE) method

Weight of evidence (WOE) method is widely used for
the prediction of potential susceptible areas for land-
slides (Stizen and Doyuran 2004; Van Westen et al.
2003; Van Westen 1993). This method is used to com-
bine the dataset of landslides through a quantitative
data-driven approach. With the WOE method prior
probability (Priorp), Conditional probabilities (Condp)
and negative and positive weights of landslide suscepti-
bility can be calculated. For ‘Priorp’ the landslide density
has to be computed as the total number of pixels within
the area covered by the landslides to the total number of
pixels in the area under study. ‘Priorp’ can be expressed
as Eq. 9;

N pix (Slide)

Priorp = P{S} ~ Noix(total) (9)

Where; ‘Priorp’ is the prior probability, P{S} is the con-
ditional probability of having a landslide ‘S’; Np;x(slide) is
the total number of pixels within the landslides in the
area of study and NP;,(total) is the total number of
pixels in the area of study.

The Conditional probabilities (Condp) is the ratio be-
tween the total number of pixels of a corresponding

Page 7 of 19

factor class within the landslides to the total number of
pixels of that factor class within the area of study (Van
Western 2002). This can be expressed by Eq. 10;

Condp = pal _ P{SnB} _ Npix{SnB}

BJ  P{B} —— Npix{B} uo)

Where; ‘Cond,’ is the conditional probability of having
landslide ‘S’ in a given parameter class ‘B’, “Np;{SnB}’ is
the total number of pixels of a parameter class ‘B’ within
the landslides and ‘Np;,{B}’ is the total number of pixels
of that factor class ‘B’ within the total area of study.

Weight of evidence (WOE) method determines the
weight for all considered predictive causative factors (B)
with respect to absence or presence of the landslides in
the area (Mohammady et al. 2012; Bonham-Carter 1994).

a

 

Wt =In

 

(12)

Where, ‘In’ is the natural log, ‘P’ is the probability, “Bi’
is the presence of potential landslide predictive causative
factor, ‘ B;’ is the absence of the potential landslide pre-
dictive causative factor, ‘S’ is the presence of landslide
and ‘ S ’ is the absence of landslide, ‘ W; ’ represents a
positive weight which implies that predictable factor is
present in landslide, ‘ W; ’ represents a negative weight
which suggests absence of predictable factor in the
landslide.

(iii) Information Value (IV) method

In information value (IV) method the weighted class
value is computed through density of landslides with re-
spect to each causative factor. For spatial landslide pre-
diction and zonation, information value method has
been utilized by many researchers such as; Mengistu
et al. (2019), Balasubramani and Kumaraswamy (2013),
Yalcin (2008), Lin and Tung (2003), Zézere et al. (2004),
Jade and Sarkar (1993), Yin and Yan (1988) etc.

The information values of various causative factors
can be used to determine the possible areas of landslide
occurrence which may facilitate in landslide hazard zon-
ation. Based on the presence or absence of the causative
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

factor classes within the past landslides the Information
values can be determined. In order to calculate the
weights for respective classes the landslide map can be
combined with the causative factor maps. Thus, land-
slide density for causative factor sub-classes can be de-
termined by overlaying the causative factors map on the
inventoried landslide map (Mengistu et al. 2019).
According to Yin and Yan (1988), if the information
value is positive the causative factor class represents
strong relationship with the landslides in the area. Ac-
cording to Van Westen et al. (1997) the weighted value
of a causative factor class can be represented as the nat-
ural logarithm of density of landslide in a factor class, di-
vided by landslide density in the total map area. The
Information value method is also named as landslide
index (W;) method. The information value can be com-
puted by utilizing eqs. 13 to 16 (Yin and Yan 1988);

ix SBI
Conditional probablity (CP) = ee (13)
. . Npix{ TS}
Priorprobablity (PP) = ————— 14
; , CP
Weight of factor class (WBi) = Dp (15)
Information valueIV) = log( WBi) (16)

Where; ‘Np;x{SBi}’ is the number of landslide pixels
within the factor class, Np;,{Bi}is the number of pixels of
a factor class, ‘Np;.{TS}’ is the total sum of pixels of
landslide of the whole study area and Np;,{A}is the total
pixels of the whole study area.

Once the Information values are obtained, the respect-
ive IVs can be assigned to each factor class and the
weighted causative factor maps can be prepared. These
causative factor maps can further be processed in GIS
environment and landslide susceptibility index (LSI) can
be computed (Eq. 17) for each pixel with the help of
raster calculated. Thus, this LSI will form the basis to
produce the landslide hazard zonation map (Mengistu
et al. 2019).

LSI = 5 _IVB (17)

Where; LSI is the landslide susceptibility index and ‘
YIVB’ is the sum total of information values for all
causative factors.

Multivariate statistical approach The landslide suscep-
tibility and hazard zonation through multivariate statis-
tical approach is based on the relationship of relative
contribution of each of the causative factor to the total
landslide susceptibility in the area (Nandi and Shakoor
2009; Kanungo et al. 2009; Ayalew and Yamagishi 2005;
Siizen and Doyuran 2004; Dai et al. 2001). In multivari-
ate methods for landslide susceptibility analysis, percent-
age of landslides for each pixel is determined and data
layer on landslide presence or absence is developed
through statistical analysis. The commonly used multi-
variate statistical methods for landslide susceptibility and
hazard zonation are; Logistic regression model, multiple
regression models and Discriminant analysis (Kanungo
et al. 2006; Guzzetti et al. 1999; Chung and Fabbri 1995;
Van Westen 1993; van Westen 1994; Yin and Yan 1988).

(i) Logistic regression method

Among various multivariate statistical methods Logis-
tic regression is the most popular method used for the
spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility and hazard
zonation (Wu et al. 2015; Schicker and Moon 2012; Gor-
sevski et al. 2000). The logistic regression method is cap-
able of predicting a binary response variable such as
presence or absence of landslides through categorical
and continuously scaled predictors (Steger et al. 2016;
Goetz et al. 2015; Felicisimo et al. 2012; Pradhan and
Lee 2009; Van Den Eeckhaut et al. 2006; Atkinson and
Massari 1998). This method is applied to predict the
probability of occurrence of landslides following the
logistic regression statistical analysis. The relationship
between the occurrence of landslides in the area and its
dependency on several variables (causative factors) can
be defined through Eq. 18 (Ayalew and Yamagishi 2005;
Menard 1995).

——— (18)
l+e*

Where; ‘P’ is the estimated probability of a landslide
occurrence which varies from O to 1 on a‘S shaped’
curve. The term ‘z’ represents a linear combination. The
logistic regression utilizes fitting of an equation (19) to
the data set;

2 bo + bi x1 + box ++ b3x3 H+ esses ++ b,. Xn (19)

Where; ‘by’ represents the intercept of the model, the
b; (i=0, 1, 2, ..., n) are the slope coefficient of the logis-
tic regression model and the x; (i=0, 1, 2, 3........... wn)
represents the independent variable.
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

Logistic regression is applicable for the situations
where either the data is continuous or discrete or com-
bination of both. This is the main advantage of logistic
regression method. However, the results of logistic re-
gression cannot identify the influence of different classes
on landslide occurrence. To apply logistic regression the
dependent variable should be binary, for example yes or
no, zero or one, absence or presence etc. (Lee 2015;
Chen and Wang 2007).

(ii) Discriminant method

Discriminant method is a commonly used method for
landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation. It is a
multivariate statistical model in which the dependent
variable is considered to be categorical rather than con-
tinuous (Gorsevski et al. 2000). The discriminant ana-
lysis facilitates to know the maximum difference for
each landslide causative factors (independent variable)
among non-landslide group and the landslide group.
Thus, it forms the basis to calculate the weights for these
causative factors (Pardeshi et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2008).
The slope units can be classified to account for landslide
free and the landslide affected classes. Further, by deter-
mining the Standardized Discriminant Function Coeffi-
cient (SDFC) relative significance of each variable can be
expressed in terms of discriminant function as a pre-
dictor of potential slope instability. Variable that shows
high coefficient are strongly correlated to absence or
presence of the landslide (Pardeshi et al. 2013; Guzzetti
et al. 2005b).

Artificial intelligence (Al) methods

Artificial intelligence (AI) method uses some of the stat-
istical concepts. However, these methods are based on
assumptions, predetermined algorithms and output. Al
methods are suitable when a direct mathematical rela-
tionship cannot be established between cause and effect
(Chowdhury and Sadek 2012).There are number of AI
methods or machine learning methods (Kavzoglu et al.
2018) that can be used for the landslide studies. These
can be categorized as; artificial neural network (ANN),
fuzzy based, hybrid, kernel based and tree based (deci-
sion tree) methods. Further, there are number of sub
methods under each category, for instant, ANN-adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system, back-propagation neural
network etc.; fuzzy based- fuzzy clustering; hybrid-SVM-
particle swarm optimization; kernel based-kernel logistic
regression, SVM (support machine vector); tree based-
bagging, decision trees, random forest etc. (Duri¢ et al.
2019; Kavzoglu et al. 2018; Goetz et al. 2015) etc. AI
methods are effective regardless of data dimension (i.e.,
the number of conditioning factors) and data type (ap-
plicable to deal with discrete and continuous data)

Page 9 of 19

(Duri¢ et al. 2019; Kavzoglu et al. 2018). Furthermore,
they can reveal good generalization performance on
many real life issues, they have few parameters to adjust
and provide the architecture of learning machines with-
out experimentation (Pawley et al. 2017). Hence, they
are more suitable for the analysis of high dimensional
data and complex systems.

Artificial neural network (ANN) method ANN
method facilitates to obtain, represent and perform map-
ping of landside susceptibility and hazard from one multi-
variate space of information into another by providing a
set of data or information relating to representative map-
ping (Pradhan and Lee 2010; Nefeslioglu et al., 2008;
Garrett 1994). The landslide is a complex process which is
resulted due to combination of various causative and trig-
gering factors. Also, the relationships between the land-
slides and the causative and triggering factors are
considered to be non-linear in nature (Ercanoglu 2005).
Therefore, in order to address such non-linear complex
relationships between the factors and the landslides ANN
method is used which includes back propagation learning
algorithm and is capable of developing rules for weight as-
signment for the respective factors (Kanungo et al. 2006;
Yesilnacar and Topal 2005; Gémez and Kavzoglu 2005;
Lee et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2002; Haykin 1999; Ripley
1996).

In ANN, back propagation is used to determine a gra-
dient (Kanungo et al. 2006) which is required to calcu-
late the weights that are used in the network. For
landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation back propa-
gation is used as shorthand to the backward propagation
of the errors. For this, at the output an error is deter-
mined which is distributed backward all along the layers
of the network (Pradhan and Lee 2010; Paola and Scho-
wengerdt 1995).The ANN facilitates the database man-
agement with qualitative or quantitative information
having rules (if/ then) that can infer results. The entry
nodes can have quantitative, qualitative, reclassified or
direct data. For landslide susceptibility study, landslide
densities of different types or determinant causative fac-
tor data can be assigned to the entry nodes. The data is
processed in the hidden layer nodes by following rules
for weighting that depends on the considered import-
ance (Chacon et al. 2006; Zell et al. 1993; Lipmann
1987). Further, the ANN method can manage imperfect
or incomplete data and it also allows analyzing non-
linear complex variable relationships between the causa-
tive factors and the landslides (Chacon et al. 2006; Lee
et al. 2003).The major limitations with ANN method are
in its computing time, required for data format conver-
sion to GIS environment and the application complexity
owing to the process in the hidden layers (Chacén et al.
2006). The ANN method is only applicable for landslides
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

which are shallow and it has limitation for deep seated
landslides (Basma and Kallas 2004; Neaupane and Achet
2004).

Support vector machines (SVM) This method is used
to solve complex classification and regression problems
(Tien Bui et al. 2015; Kavzoglu et al. 2013; Ballabio and
Sterlacchini 2012; Kavzoglu and Colkesen 2009; Brenning
2005). SVMs are originally developed as a binary classifier
aiming to find a linear hyperplane that separates two clas-
ses optimally (Vapnik 1999). For binary classification
problems, SVMs attempt to find a separating hyperplane
in the feature space such that the distance between the
positive and negative samples is maximized for the linearly
separable case (Kavzoglu et al. 2013). The hyperplane pro-
viding maximum margin between two classes is called
optimum hyperplane and the points that constrain the
width of the margin are called support vectors. In many
classification and regression problems, it is difficult to sep-
arate data linearly. In such cases, the technique can be ex-
tended to allow for nonlinear decision surfaces (Cortes
and Vapnik 1995).The main idea behind SVM is to find
the boundary line that separates the two classes, but in
such a way that the boundary line creates a maximum
separation between the classes (Han et al. 2019; Kavzoglu
et al. 2018; He et al., 2012).

Probabilistic approach

In order to evaluate landslide susceptibility and hazard
zonation the degree of relationship between the past
landslide distribution and the causative factors is con-
verted to a value which is based on a probability distri-
bution function. Probabilistic approach helps _ in
prediction of spatial and temporal landslide distribution
probability in the given area (Lari et al. 2014; Guzzetti
et al. 2005b). The approach utilizes the comparison of
spatial landslide distribution with the considered causa-
tive factors (explanatory variables) in a framework of
probabilistic theory (Lari et al. 2014; Kanungo et al.
2009; Straub and Schubert 2008). The probabilistic ap-
proach though considered quantitative however it has
certain degree of subjectivity in assignment of weights to
various causative factors (Kanungo et al. 2006). Thus,
probabilistic approach may be considered as semi-
quantitative.

Deterministic approach

Deterministic approach accounts for landslide hazard
evaluation following mechanical laws. These methods in-
cludes empirical methods (Raghuvanshi, 2019; Liu and
Chen 2007; Hack 1998; Anbalagan 1992; Romana 1985;
Selby 1980), kinematic methods (Raghuvanshi, 2019;
ZainAlabideen and Helal 2016; Karaman et al. 2013;
Kulatilake et al. 2011; Goodman 1989), static infinite

Page 10 of 19

slope modeling (Pack et al. 1998; Dietrich et al. 1995),
dynamic infinite slope modeling (Simoni et al. 2008;
Baum et al. 2002), 2-D (Sharma et al. 1995; Hoek and
Bray 1981) and 3-D limit equilibrium and numerical
modeling (Raghuvanshi, 2019; Tang et al. 2016; Karaman
et al. 2013; GEO-SLOPE 2011; Gitirana Jr. et al. 2008;
Stead et al. 2006; Hungr and Rawlings 1995). The main
factors that are considered for deterministic techniques
are; slope geometry, discontinuity characteristics and its
relation to the slope, groundwater condition and surface
drainage (Raghuvanshi, 2019; Wang and Niu 2009;
Ayalew et al. 2004; Turrini and Visintainer 1998; Anba-
lagan 1992), rainfall, seismicity and manmade activities
(Girma et al. 2015; Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a, 2014b;
Wang and Niu 2009; Dahal et al. 2006; Gorsevski et al.
2006b; Malamud et al. 2004; Bommer and Rodriguez
2002; Keefer 2000) etc. It is believed that all these factors
in combination will be responsible for the landsides or
relative instability of slopes (Raghuvanshi, 2019). The de-
terministic techniques do not require long term data.
Also, landslide inventory data is not required (Kuriakose
2010). These techniques primarily rely on the physical
laws that are responsible in defining the stability of slope
(Guzzetti et al. 2000). Since the deterministic techniques
require detailed data on geotechnical parameters there-
fore collecting such detailed data over large areas make
these techniques limited to small areas, effectively lim-
ited to individual slopes (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a,
2014b; Fall et al. 2006; Kanungo et al. 2009; Aleotti and
Chowdhury 1999).

Validation methods

All statistical methods, machine learning or artificial
intelligence and some of the semi-quantitative ap-
proaches are tested by field observations and statistical
tests. Sample field observation may be applicable for
every type of landslide studies except for small area or
single landslide studies. However, statistical validations
are used for statistical, AI and semi-quantitative ap-
proaches such as AHP, fuzzy logic etc. Receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) is used for statistical, Al and semi-
quantitative approaches. For multivariate statistical ap-
proaches there are different validation methods starting
from data reliability to model accuracy in addition to
ROC. In order to check the performance of the predic-
tion ability of the above mentioned methods the most
popular technique is receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curve. The ROC curve represents a plot of the
probability with true positive identified landslides against
the probability of false identified landslides, as the cut-
off probability varies (Gorsevski et al. 2006a). With the
selection of decision parameter that adjust the tradeoff
between the proportion of correctly identified pixels and
the incorrectly identified pixels, the ROC performance
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

curve can be varied systematically (Kavzoglu et al. 2014;
Swets 1988). Other validation methods that can be used
are landslide density analysis, landslide percentage com-
parison, relative landslide density index; relative error
etc.

Advantage and limitation of each method

The different methods used for landslide susceptibility
analysis has their own advantage and disadvantage owing
to its application, data procurement and scales at which
these can be applied (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a, 2014b;
Fall et al. 2006; Kanungo et al. 2006; Casagli et al. 2004;
Guzzetti et al. 1999; Leroi 1997).

Geomorphological methods can be applied in relatively
short period of time at low cost. These methods can be
applied in relatively large areas (small scale map) and
can cover inaccessible area through various multi-
temporal satellite image interpretations (Chelli et al.
2015; Delmonaco et al. 2013; Guzzetti et al. 1999). Since
these methods are applied at small scale therefore geo-
morphological details considered in these methods are
limited (Guzzetti et al. 2005a, 2005b; Ibsen and Bruns-
den 1996). Thus, the reliability and application of results
is limited for specific purpose. Similarly, the limitations
of landslide inventories refer to their subjectivity and to
the difficulty of assessing their reliability. The reliability
of archive inventories depends largely on the quality and
abundance of information sources (Raghuvanshi et al.
2014a; Guzzetti et al. 2005a, 2005b; Cruden and Varnes
1996; Ibsen and Brunsden 1996;).

Further, the advantage in heuristic evaluation tech-
nique is in its simplicity. The weight assigned by the ex-
pert to various causative factors do not need historical
data base and are simply based on the judgment of rela-
tive contribution of each parameter class. These tech-
niques are popular because of their simplicity in
application. These techniques are based on data, primar-
ily acquired from the field and are well supported by the
judgment and experience of an evaluator (Raghuvanshi
et al. 2014a, 2014b). However, the major disadvantage of
these techniques is in its subjectivity in assigning weight
and ratings to the parameter classes (Raghuvanshi et al.
2014a; Delmonaco et al. 2013; Guzzetti et al. 1999).
Thus, the landslide susceptibility evaluated by heuristic
technique may vary considerably if evaluated by different
experts.

The statistical approaches are primarily based on stat-
istical relationship between past landslides and various
causative factors. In these techniques the weights for
various causative factors are determined statistically (Dai
and Lee 2001). These techniques are based on the ana-
lysis of functional relations between instability factors
(thematic variables) and the past and present distribu-
tion of slope failures (landslide inventory) (Negassa and

Page 11 of 19

Kala 2015; Guzzetti et al. 2000). The advantage of statis-
tical techniques is that these techniques can be applied
over a large area and the ratings for various factor clas-
ses can be deduced statistically from the past landslide
data. However, the limitation of these methods is in
collection of past landslide inventory data over large
areas. Since the general rules for landslide susceptibil-
ity are formulated from the past landslide data there-
fore well distributed past landslides in the study area
will ensure good quality results. Thus, the type, extent
and distribution of past landslide data in the study
area is a necessary input for all statistical techniques
(Negassa and Kala 2015).

Additionally, the statistical models require large efforts
to collect and validate the necessary input data, which
are often not readily available. Besides, for better results,
interaction is required between geomorphologists and
the statisticians to process the landslide and geo-
environmental data to avoid unrealistic results. Further,
statistical models are influenced (negatively) by the ex-
tent of the study area, making it difficult to compare
susceptibility classes from different locations. Also, often
susceptibility maps prepared by statistical methods are
difficult to understand by a non-specialists, including
planners and policymakers (Reichenbach et al. 2018;
Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a, 2014b; Fall et al. 2006; Van
Westen et al. 2003; Van Westen et al. 1997).

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are utilized
to simulate human intelligence for either solving a
problem or making a decision. AI provides the advan-
tages of permanency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness
while also addressing uncertainty and speed in either
solving a problem or reaching a decision (Chowdhury
and Sadek 2012).

The main advantage of using ANN methods is that
there is no need for statistical variables in the process.
The ANN methods allow the target classes to be defined
in relation to their distribution in each source data set,
facilitating the integration of data emerging from remote
sensing, GIS, etc. Further, the time involved is shorter
than required for most statistical techniques and calcula-
tion pixel by pixel is possible. The method allows incom-
plete or imperfect data to be managed as well as the
analysis of interactions between non-linear or complex
variables (Chacon et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2003). According
to Chacén et al. (2006) ANN has limitations that are
complexity for application due to the internal process
within the hidden layers and the amount of computing
time needed for changes in data format to be used in
GIS. Also it has limited application in deep landslides,
rather it can mainly be used for shallow landslide
(Basma and Kallas 2004; Neaupane and Achet 2004).

Geotechnical modeling or deterministic approach re-
lies upon the understanding of the physical laws that
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

control the slope instability (Guzzetti et al. 2000). Geo-
technical modeling are useful for quantitative investiga-
tion for landslides, however these techniques are useful
only in areas of limited extent due to difficulty of collect-
ing geotechnical data with appropriate resolution over
larger regions (Negassa and Kala 2015; Kanungo et al.
2009; Aleotti and Chowdhury 1999).

Selection criteria

As discussed, there are several techniques available for
evaluation of landslide susceptibility and hazard zon-
ation. The choice of selection of appropriate technique
for landslide study will depend on the criteria such as;
investigation purpose, the extent of the area to be cov-
ered, the types of mapping units, the scale of map to be
produced, type of data to be used, type of landslides,
availability of resources, capability and skill set of evalu-
ator, accessibility of the study area etc. (Guzzetti et al.
2000, 2012; Van Westen et al. 2005).

The landslide studies may be carried out for various
purposes these may be primarily for construction sites, re-
gional land-use planning, and evaluation of susceptibility
of an area, for hazard zonation and mitigation measures.
For each of these purposes specific type of technique has
to be followed. Landslide studies for new construction
sites requires techniques that may provide quantitative re-
sults of slope stability that may directly be utilized for de-
sign purpose. These studies are site specific and needs to
be carried out at large scale (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a,
2014b; Fall et al. 2006). The most appropriate techniques
which may provide required results are deterministic tech-
niques (Chimidi et al. 2017; Negassa and Kala 2015;
Kanungo et al. 2006). Further, if the purpose is for re-
gional planning, depending on the area coverage, heuristic
or statistical techniques may be followed. The heuristic
techniques generally require considerable field data
(Ermias et al. 2017; Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a, 2014b)
therefore these techniques may be conveniently applied at
local scale. However, statistical techniques may be con-
veniently applied at medium scale. In some cases, depend-
ing on the purpose, integration of techniques may also be
followed to get the desired results.

The scale of mapping will depend on the extent of the
area to be covered, the purpose for which landslide study
has to be carried out and the availability of data and re-
sources (Huabin et al. 2005; Aleotti and Chowdhury
1999). The different scales proposed for landslide studies
has been classified as; detail scale (> 1:5000), large scale
(< 1:5000-1:10,000), Medium scale (1:25,000—1:50,000)
and Regional scale (< 1:250,000) (Huabin et al. 2005).
Similarly, IAEG, Commission on Landslides (1990) and
CEOS (2001) have classified landslide mapping scales as;
Large scale (1:5000—1:15,000), Medium scale (1:25,000-—
1:100,000), Regional scale (1:100,000—1:500,000) and

Page 12 of 19

National scale (< 1:500,000). The detail scale or large
scale are applicable for construction sites where deter-
ministic techniques are applied for slope stability evalu-
ation and where only single element at risk is considered
(Corominas et al. 2014). The medium scale is applicable
for land-use planning where evaluation of susceptibility
of the area and hazard zonation is required. The land-
slide studies at medium scale are required at the prelim-
inary stage of regional developmental plans or for the
evaluation of the possible instability problems related to
the development of large engineering projects such as;
dam and reservoir projects.

The maps prepared at medium scale delineate the areas
that are susceptible for landslides and may be a constraint
for the development of engineering projects. However,
they do not provide required data for design purpose
(Soeters and Van Westen 1996). Further, landslide studies
at national mapping scale are carried out covering very
large areas. Studies at such scale are basically carried out
to facilitate national policy makers. These maps will pro-
vide low level of details as the investigation is carried out
by following general rules (Corominas et al. 2014; Soeters
and Van Westen 1996). Table 1 shows the application of
various landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation tech-
niques at different scales, as sourced and modified from
the works of Soeters and van Westen (1996) and Aleotti
and Chowdhury 1999).

Other important criteria related to selection of appro-
priate technique for landslide studies is related to the
type of data to be used. The method by which the re-
quired primary data on causative factors and landslide
inventory will be collected and the secondary data that is
available often forms the basis to adopt the appropriate
technique for landslide studies. If systematic multi-stage
historical landslide registered data in good quality and
quantity is available statistical approaches may be ap-
plied effectively. However, such systematic data, in most
of the cases, is not maintained by the concerned author-
ities (Girma et al. 2015; Negassa and Kala 2015). Thus,
the landslide inventory data is produced through remote
sensing and field based investigations. However, the
manifestations for past landslides may not always be vis-
ible due to vegetation cover or due to displaced soils or
due to erosional processes. Thus, the landslide inventory
data generated through remote sensing or through field
investigation may not be complete and the landslide sus-
ceptibility evaluated may not always produce actual re-
sults. Also, if systematic multi-temporal data on past
landslides and other governing factors is amply available
both statistical and probabilistic approaches can be ap-
plied effectively for landslide studies. The deterministic
techniques are scale dependent and may require good
quality of geological and geotechnical data (Raghuvanshi
et al. 2014a). Therefore, deterministic techniques needs

to be adopted only when the study area is relatively
small and the possible resource to generate good quality
geological and geotechnical data is available. Further,
most of the heuristic approaches do not require detailed
landslide inventory data however; they may require con-
siderable field data (Girma et al. 2015; Raghuvanshi et al.
2014a) on various parameters, particularly on geological
factors. Thus, the heuristic techniques may only be con-
sidered when the study area is relative small, area is well
accessible for field investigation and sufficient time and
resource is available.

Discussion

Landslide is a complex process that is resulted due to
combination of several inherent causative and external
triggering factors (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Anbalagan
1992). For landslide susceptibility evaluation it is import-
ant to know these factors and to asses there possible influ-
ence in inducing instability to the slopes. A_ basic
assumption which is followed in most of the techniques in
landslide studies, particularly for quantitative techniques
is that; the combination of causative factors that has lead
to the past landslides in an area if reoccur in other areas,
again landslides can be expected. Therefore, it is import-
ant to evaluate causative factors and assess their possible
relationship with the past landslides in the area; this will
form the basis for the prediction of the potential areas
where landslides may occur in future (Chimidi et al. 2017;
Girma et al. 2015; Negassa and Kala 2015).

The qualitative approaches can effectively be applied
at small or large scale and are used to delineate the po-
tential landslide areas. The landslide inventory approach,
which is direct mapping method, are used to show the
landslide distribution in the area and they also provide
data for landslide density analysis (Reichenbach et al.
2018; Guzzetti et al. 1999; Soeters and Van Westen
1996). The landslide inventory mapping is the most
straight-forward and are basic input for most of the
quantitative approaches (Chimidi et al. 2017; Negassa
and Kala 2015; Lan et al. 2004; Dai et al. 2002). Land-
slide inventory approaches are focused to analyze distri-
bution of landslides, to classify the landslides, to evaluate
the temporal change in pattern of landslides and to de-
termine density of landslides in various terrain units

(Guzzetti et al. 2012). Further, the indirect method in-
cludes geomorphological mapping and techniques that
are based on qualitative map combinations. These tech-
niques include assessment of parameters that have sig-
nificant influence on landslide process. These techniques
involve combination of various causative factor maps.
For this, based on the expert opinion weight and ratings
are assigned to causative factors and the factor classes
(Reichenbach et al. 2018; Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a; Aya-
lew and Yamagishi 2005; Anbalagan 1992). In general,
the indirect approaches; heuristic approaches are sub-
jective in nature and greatly depend on the expert opin-
ion and evaluation (Guzzetti et al. 1999; Aleotti and
Chowdhury 1999). However, they are simple in applica-
tion and can utilize more actual field observed data well
supported by the experience of an evaluator (Raghuvan-
shi et al. 2014a).

Most of the statistical techniques can effectively be ap-
plied at medium scale (Girma et al. 2015; Fell et al.
2008; Lee and Min 2001). Also, statistical techniques can
be applied at small scale however the results thus pro-
duced are less reliable. Since, statistical techniques are
based on historical landslide inventory data therefore
collection of such data over very large areas is practically
not feasible. Thus, because of this limitation at small
scale the statistical techniques may not provide reliable
results.

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have an advantage
of permanency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness and
they also address uncertainty and rapid means of solving
a problem for quick decision (Chowdhury and Sadek
2012).Further, the ANN methods allow the target classes
to be defined in relation to their distribution in each
source data set, facilitating the integration of data pro-
duced from various sources. The process requires less
time as compared to other statistical techniques. The
method allows analysis of interactions between non-
linear or complex variables (Chacén et al. 2006; Lee
et al. 2003). ANN has limited application in deep
landslides and can conveniently be used for shallow
landslide evaluation (Basma and Kallas 2004; Neaupane
and Achet 2004).

The deterministic techniques are most suitable when
applied at large scale, as these techniques require
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

considerable field data on geological and geotechnical
parameters. Ideally, they are most suitable for construc-
tion sites and these techniques may produce results that
can directly be used for the design purpose (Chimidi
et al. 2017; Negassa and Kala 2015; Kanungo et al.
2006). Moreover, the quantitative techniques are reliable
as these are objective in nature and the predictions for
landslide susceptibility or slope instability is based on
the actual realistic data and interpretations. The quanti-
tative techniques overcome the subjectivity owing to ex-
pert evaluations and are capable of producing repeatable
results (Safaei et al. 2011; Carrara et al. 1991; Carrara
et al. 1992; Carrara et al. 1995).

Often it is difficult to make a choice on the selection
of an appropriate approach for landslide susceptibility
evaluation and hazard zonation mapping. It is reasonable
to consider factors that may guide to adopt an appropri-
ate approach. These factors are related to investigation
purpose, the extent of the area to be covered, the types
of mapping units, the scale of map to be produced, type
of data to be used, type of landslides, availability of re-
sources, capability and skill set of an evaluator, accessi-
bility of the study area etc. (Guzzetti et al. 2012;
Guzzetti et al. 2000; Van Westen et al. 2005).

The purpose for which the landslide studies needs to
be carried out is the most important factor in deciding
about the technique. For regional planning purpose stat-
istical or heuristic techniques are most appropriate ap-
proaches. The statistical techniques for this purpose may
conveniently be applied at medium scale whereas the
heuristic techniques may be applied in relatively small
area at both medium and large scales. At regional scales
heuristic techniques are not practically feasible as these
techniques generally requires considerable field data on
various causative factors (Ermias et al. 2017; Raghuvan-
shi et al. 2014a). Therefore, heuristic techniques may be
conveniently applied at a local scale. The most appropri-
ate techniques that may be applied at new construction
site are the deterministic techniques. These techniques
can be applied at large scales, most effectively applied
for individual slopes and are capable of providing quan-
titative results that can directly be applied in engineering
design (Chimidi et al. 2017; Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a;
Fall et al. 2006; Kanungo et al. 2006). Landslide and re-
lated slope stability studies may be required for new pro-
ject sites that may include road construction sites, canal
alignments, building sites on slopes or adjoining to
slopes and valley slopes along the dam reservoirs. For all
such construction sites the landslide studies needs to be
carried out by deterministic or probabilistic approaches,
even if the study area is large. For such construction
sites the required results must be of quantitative nature
that can directly be utilized for the design purpose. The
data generated through heuristic or statistical techniques

Page 14 of 19

may not be useful for the construction sites as these
techniques are only capable of delineating potential haz-
ard zone of landslide susceptibility and the results thus
produced cannot be utilized for design purpose. More-
over, for the preliminary study for the road design or for
the town planning, inventory or statistical approaches
may be adopted to identify the potential landslide and
related unstable areas. However, at detailed investigation
stage deterministic or probabilistic approaches can be
followed.

For landslide studies selection of appropriate mapping
units is also important. Different type of mapping units
such as; grid cell (pixels), slope unit, terrain units,
unique condition units, geo-hydrological units, topo-
graphical units and political or administrative units may
be adopted (Lee 2015; Guzzetti et al. 1999). For statis-
tical and physical based approaches, grid cell or pixels
mapping units in the raster data sets are most appropri-
ate (Reichenbach et al. 2018; Lee 2015; Guzzetti et al.
2006). Similarly, unique condition units are commonly
used in probabilistic approaches in both raster and vec-
tor data sets (Guzzetti et al. 1999; Carrara et al. 1995;
Chung and Fabbri 1995). The primary advantage of
adopting unique condition units is in their simplicity by
which they can be obtained in GIS environment and in
fact relatively they reduces some of the conceptual and
operational problems of the grid cells (Reichenbach
et al. 2018; Lee 2015) .

Further, the basis to adopt appropriate technique for
landslide studies is also guided by the method by which
the required data on causative factors will be collected.
The collection of required data on causative factors and
landslide inventory for various techniques may differ
considerably. For statistical approaches systematic multi-
stage historical landslide registered data in good quality
and quantity is mandatory, as this data will form the
basis for the prediction of potential landslides in the
given area. Further, landslide inventory data is often not
well maintained by the concerned authorities. Therefore,
as a general practice the landslide inventory data is pro-
duced through remote sensing and field based investiga-
tions. This consumes considerable time and resources.
Therefore, availability of data on various causative fac-
tors and systematic landslide inventory data will not only
save the time but it will also ensure good quality results.
The other aspect related to availability of data is related
to the area coverage. If secondary data on causative fac-
tors and the landslide inventory is available in good
quality and quantity, relatively large area can be covered
for the landslide study. In contrast non availability of re-
quired secondary data for statistical approach will force
to restrict the landslide study to limited coverage area.
Similarly, the deterministic techniques are _ scale
dependent and may require good quality of geological
Shano et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:18

and geotechnical data (Raghuvanshi et al. 2014a). These
techniques can only be adopted when the study area is
relatively small and the required resource and time to
generate good quality of geological and geotechnical data
is available.

For relatively small areas, qualitative approaches par-
ticularly heuristic approaches are effective for the delin-
eation of the potential landslide susceptible areas. Most
of the data collections in the direct method or geomor-
phological analysis are through remote sensing sources,
supplemented and verified from the field observations.
In general, medium scale mapping is used to investigate
landslide susceptibility and hazard zonation by using
statistical, heuristic and probabilistic approaches. Large
scale mapping is used to investigate specific area particu-
larly for construction purpose or for landslide hazard
mitigation.

Conclusion

For proper landslide mitigation and management, sus-
ceptibility evaluation and hazard zonation is very im-
portant. Landslides are influenced by several inherent
causative and external triggering factors that vary signifi-
cantly from place to place. Proper evaluation of these
factors is essential for landslide studies. Each of these
factors may influence landslide process and in combin-
ation they result into landslide activity. Further, various
approaches that are used for landslide evaluation studies
can broadly be divided into qualitative and quantitative
approaches. Qualitative approaches include geomorpho-
logical analysis (inventory approach) and heuristic tech-
niques (knowledge based approach) whereas quantitative
approach includes statistical and deterministic tech-
niques. The qualitative approaches can effectively be ap-
plied at small or large scale and are used to delineate the
potential landslide areas. Statistical approaches are the
most commonly used methods for landslide susceptibil-
ity and hazard zonation. The statistical techniques can
be classified into; Bivariate and Multivariate statistical
approaches. In bivariate statistical techniques contribu-
tion of individual causative factors in inducing landslide
in an area is evaluated separately. Such contribution of
various causative factors in inducing landslides is
assessed quantitatively through density ratio. Combining
these density ratios for various factor classes will form
the basis for landslide hazard evaluation and zonation in
the given area. The commonly used methods under bi-
variate statistical approach are; Frequency Analysis (like-
lihood ratio) method, Weighted overlay model, Weights
of Evidence Model, Information Value Model (IV) and
Fuzzy logic methods. The multivariate statistical ap-
proach is based on the relationship of relative contribu-
tion of each of the causative factor to the total landslide
susceptibility in the area. In multivariate methods,

Page 15 of 19

percentage of landslides for each pixel is determined and
data layer on landslide presence or absence is developed
through statistical analysis. The commonly used multi-
variate statistical methods are; Logistic regression model,
multiple regression models, Discriminant analysis, con-
ditional analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

The quantitative techniques are reliable as these are ob-
jective in nature and the predictions for landslide suscepti-
bility or slope instability is based on the actual realistic
data and interpretations. The quantitative techniques
overcome the subjectivity, owing to the expert evaluations
and are capable of producing repeatable results. Further,
for the selection of appropriate technique for landslide
hazard evaluation and zonation the factors that may be
considered to adopt an appropriate approach are; investi-
gation purpose, the extent of the area to be covered, the
types of mapping units, the scale of map to be produced,
type of data to be used, type of landslides, availability of
resources, capability and skill set of an evaluator and ac-
cessibility of the study area. Finally, landslide is a complex
natural geo-hazard and it requires good understanding on
the governing factors. It is necessary to adopt appropriate
technique for the landslide evaluation and zonation, for
which above mentioned selection criteria needs to be
followed.
