Introduction

Mobile devices are often used by online social network (OSN) users to access, share,
and exchange information, whenever and wherever possible [1—3]. One relatively recent
trend is crowdsourcing for information, share resources, and/or to get certain tasks
done, as evidenced by the increasing number and variety of crowdsourcing applications,
such as Amazon Mechanical Turks, chats (e.g., Firechat), knowledge sharing (e.g., Fig. 1),
ridesharing (e.g., Uber) and accommodation sharing (e.g., Airbnb).

Crowdsourcing [4] often refers to a solution pattern which outsources the tasks
that were previously performed by full-time employees to non-specific solution pro-
viders via public online platforms. Such crowdsourcing can be voluntary (unpaid) or
paid. Crowd computing [5] is a computing model, which aims to integrate numer-

ous users who may know each other (i.e., the crowd) and computing resources (i.e.,

the computer cluster) on the Internet, to handle complex tasks that are difficult to
accomplish with existing computing technologies. In addition, the human-centric
computational abstraction called situation can be used into Human-Embedded
Computing or End-User Embedded Computing [6].

To maximize human individual or collective intelligence in crowd computing,
researchers have studied task assignment that allows one to assign real-time crowd
tasks to appropriate user crowd for execution [7-9]. The majority of existing task
assignment approaches in the crowd computing literature consider user behaviors
as homogenous [10]; thereby, completely ignoring the influence of such behaviors
on the recycling results. Existing approaches also often assume static scenes [11],
although tasks occur dynamically in practical applications and results should be
returned immediately within a specific time. Therefore, such approaches are gener-
ally not practicable in real-world applications.

In this paper, we focus on the task itself. This is because in crowd computing, user
crowds are often passive, and user multi-dimensional information, functional expe-
rience, and integrity are minimally considered. The SocialSitu theory [12], for exam-
ple, analyzes the SocialSitu(t) sequence of users’ access behaviors and draws out
the patterns of such behaviors under different intentions (i.e., frequent functional
experience). Hence, in this paper we propose a task assignment algorithm to deter-
mine user task suitability, based on SocialSitu. After finding user crowds who fre-
quently use a certain function, the task of calculating task suitability and assigning
the related crowd tasks based on user crowds’ multi-dimensional information will
become considerably accurate.

The contributions of this paper are twofold. (1) We design a task assignment
method that can be used to perform crowd assessment for the security and privacy
of online social networks. (2) Moreover, we propose a task assignment algorithm to
determine user task suitability based on SocialSitu, in order to achieve efficient and
accurate assignment of crowd tasks about security and privacy.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. “Related work” section briefly
introduces the extant literature. “Task assign method of crowd assessment for online
social networks” and “Task assignment algorithm of user task suitability based on
SocialSitu” sections present our proposed task assignment method and algorithm,
respectively. In “Experimental setup and analysis” section, we describe the crowd
assessment experiments and discuss the findings which show that the proposed
approach facilitates efficient task assignment and improves the task precision and

recall. The last section concludes this paper.

Related work
Context-Aware (CA) [13-15] was first proposed by Schilit et al. (1994), in which a scene
is defined as a location, a collection of people and objects in the vicinity, and changes
in these objects. Chang et al. [16, 17] described situation analysis theory and the sig-
nificance and influence of Situ architecture in software engineering, They provided a
detailed description of the Situ architecture, which updates services in real time by iden-
tifying users’ new intentions in software engineering; thereby, providing users with truly
personalized services. To discover users’ intentions in social media in a timely manner
and provide additional personalized services to users, Zhang et al. [12] developed the
SocialSitu theory based on the Situ theory of Chang et al. [16, 17], and designed a dis-
covery method for user behavior patterns in multimedia social networks. This method
analyzes users’ SocialSitu(t) sequences and draws their behavior patterns under different
intentions. Consequently, users’ current intentions can be predicted by comparing their
current behavior sequences with those in the database.

In crowd computing, existing task assignment structures remain relatively simple and
a few cases involve tasks that are randomly assigned (i.e., randomly assigns tasks to user
crowds). Therefore, most of the tasks cannot be handled by suitably qualified individu-
als and the advantages of crowd computing human-computer collaboration cannot be
completely realized. An et al. [18] proposed an algorithm for the discovery and selection
of service nodes based on the analytic hierarchy process. This takes into consideration
users’ mobility, complexity, real-time performance and other characteristics. In [19],
Zhang proposed a simple and effective framework, MacroWiz, to manage the wisdom
of crowds on mobile social networks. MacroWiz encourages online users to contribute
their own knowledge or opinions through an incentive mechanism. This framework
also assists task requester in collecting answers, choosing the reliable answers, and
making final decisions. In the respect of spatial crowdsourcing, in order to cope with
some problems about the multi-skill aware task assignment, Song et al. [20] presented
Online-Exact algorithm and Online-Greedy algorithm. For the uncertain mobile crowd-
sourcing scenario, Guo et al. [21] found out that the results of mobile crowdsourcing
largely depend on the quality of location-related users. Subsequently, Sun et al. [22] for-
mulated an optimization problem of mobile crowdsourcing task allocation by using the
trustworthiness of workers and movement distance costs. Then, they present a Markov
decision process according to mobile crowdsourcing model to solve the problem of
dynamic trust-aware task allocation. In [23], Mao et al. proposed an optimal user crowd
algorithm. This algorithm assigns tasks to the least number of users based on users’
historical task completion status; thereby, minimizing the total cost and ensuring the
completion of a task. Zhang et al. [24] designed a task assignment algorithm with user
theme awareness. The algorithm is designed to solve the blind randomness of random
task assign algorithm and obtain users’ themes (i.e., their fields of specialization) by ana-
lyzing their historical task information. In this manner, the completeness of the overall
tasks is substantially improved. However, users’ themes are constantly changing. Hence,
obtaining these themes solely by historical data is no longer possible. Evidently, such
themes are inaccurate and not real-time. In [25], Kim et al. presented a multi-layered
information analysis approach based on crowdsourcing theory and effectively uses topic

analysis to track scientific issues. In social networks privacy preservation and trust ways,
Zhang et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:23 Page 4 of 19

Yuan et al. [26] investigated privacy protection in spatial crowdsourcing and presented
a privacy-preserving framework. Specifically, they also proposed a grid-based location
protection method to protect the locations of workers and tasks. Moreover, Li et al. [27]
exploited a secure grid-based index method to solve the problem of privacy-aware spa-
tial crowdsourcing. This method can not only protect workers location privacy but also
improve the spatial task processing time. In [28], Sharma et al. presented a novel trust
relaying and privacy preservation architecture which included a distributed query sys-
tem for social Internet of Things by using edge-crowdsourcing techniques. Ma et al. [29]
utilized some advanced blockchain technologies to study security, privacy, and trust in
the field of crowdsourcing services. Wang et al. [30] combined incentive mechanism and
the techniques of location privacy-preserving to enhance the validity of mobile crowd-
sourcing systems. In [31], Chi et al. developed an effective location privacy protection
method and solved the problem between location privacy protection and service quality,
to better assess the reliability of workers for task allocation, Jiang et al. [32] developed a
context-aware reliable and efficient crowdsourcing technique in simple social networks
and multiple social networks. In [33], Huang et al. put forward an efficient reputation
evalution technique for crowdsourcing participant, which is based on some important
machine learning methods and multidimensional evaluation index mechanism.

In summary, most current assignment methods are unable to find suitable crowds for
certain tasks; consequently, leading to low completeness, precision, and recall. To solve
these problems, this study defines the decision factors that affect task assignment and
suitability of user tasks in online social networks. The current research completely con-
siders users’ functional experience and historical information, which are used as bases
to design a task assign method of crowd assessment for the security of online social net-
works. This study also proposes a task assign algorithm based on SocialSitu user task
suitability, which can assign crowd tasks efficiently and accurately in real time.

Task assign method of crowd assessment for online social networks
Crowd assessment system architecture
Crowd computing has five basic elements, namely: user crowds C, man-machine inter-
action M, purposeful crowd activity A, tasks T, and collective intelligence J. We use these
characteristics as bases to propose a crowd computing application scene (i.e., crowd
assessment) and discuss the function and architecture of different roles within scenes
(see Fig. 1). Accordingly, crowd assessment has three steps, and each step is based on a
crowd computing system. First, we discuss the input. Many users with certain purposes
gather to form a user crowd. Interactive devices serve as media for user crowds and the
system. Then, task publishers have many uncompleted tasks that should be solved by
users with different backgrounds. This way, the relationship is established among the
publication- > allocation- > execution. Second, we focus on processing. Crowd com-
puting system analyzes the information of task collection T and user collection U and
employs the task assign algorithm to select the suitable user crowd u, for task t,. Then,
the output is discussed. After the processing of crowd computing system, the corre-
sponding results or strategies will be obtained and data will be stored.

Three roles are mainly involved in crowd assessment, which are user collection

U = (id, o, x, 6, A), crowd computing system platform P, and task collection T= (id, o,
Zhang et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:23 Page 5 of 19

g, 0, y). Task publishers publish task ¢, (t; € T) to system P. Users log into the system
to query and receive task ¢t,. The system finds user crowd u, (uv; € U) suitable for ¢,
through the analysis of tasks and users. Moreover, id is the unique identifier of the
two and w is the description of t,, which is the general basic information. @ refers to
the category of t, and 0 and y are the number of users required for t, and deadlines,
respectively. o is the devices for user crowd u,, including mobile devices m and fixed
devices w. x is the field of specialization of users, 5 is the historical information, such
as degree of completion and degree of correlation, and J is the users’ situation infor-
mation (i.e., SocialSitu(t) sequence).

The purpose of a crowd assessment system is to assign appropriate assessment
tasks to user crowd. Accordingly, the system architecture must meet the following
three basic requirements: (1) user crowd who is best suitable for some tasks that can
be found; (2) the server can independently design, publish, analyze, and process the
result data; and (3) interface for users to perform tasks can be provided. Therefore, a
hierarchical architecture is designed to meet these requirements. Figure 2 shows the
crowd assessment system architecture. The specific layered architecture is designed
as follows

Social platform facilities layer

The first layer is the social platform facilities layer, where social media platform server
designs and publishes crowd assessment tasks. The main function of this layer is to
process data returned to it from users who have completed tasks. In addition, the user

crowds and task information are simultaneously updated.

Data processing middle layer

The second layer is the data processing middle layer. Data transmission passes the
data of crowd users of social platform facilities layer to the data processing mid-
dle layer and assigns the appropriate tasks to crowd users based on the task assign
method of crowd assessment proposed in this study. Moreover, this layer organizes,
analyzes, and stores the result data from the crowd user application layer.

Crowd user application layer

The third layer is the crowd user application layer, which provides the corresponding
user interfaces. After users accept the crowd assessment tasks, they can forward these
tasks to friends who have common interests. After the tasks are executed, the result

data will be returned to the data processing middle layer for processing.

Hierarchical assign structure

Due to online social network task assignment crowd selection existing many optional
schemes, among the degree of completion, service response time, the degree of corre-
lation, operation behaviors, and coincidence for each schemes have strong fuzziness.
Hence, it is difficult to determine the importance of these attributes that affect deci-
sion making. Aim at the complexity and fuzziness of task assignment crowd selec-
tion, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process [34] (FAHP) is adopted for decision-making.
The FAHP breaks down elements that are constantly related to decision-making into
target, criteria, attributes, and other layers. FAHP performs qualitative and quanti-
tative analysis based on the comprehensive consideration of various factors that
affect things. Accordingly, this process is a scientific assessment and decision-making
method. This study defines task assignment factors and their attributes by analyzing
that affects task assignment and builds a hierarchical assign structure based on this

analysis.

Task assign factor

In OSNs, users’ intentions may change constantly, which are ultimately reflected in
changes in users’ behaviors. Moreover, changes in behaviors directly reflect users’
experience of certain functions. Therefore, task assignment patterns in online social
networks are changed in response to such changes of users. Task assignment should
consider users’ service capability and focus on their functional experience. This study
analyzes the operation behaviors and historical information of online social users and
defines three task assign factors (TAF) that affect task assignment. This study also
defines and calculates user-task-suitability (UTS) through the following three fac-
tors: service feedback quality (SFQ), operation behavior (OB), and coincidence degree
(CD).
Zhang et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:23 Page 7 of 19

Service feedback quality

Definition 1 Service feedback quality is an objective assessment of the degree of com-
pletion of social user tasks by the platform by assigning them to completion. SFQ of
user U, is related to historical information 6 of the user. Moreover, the historical service

parameters of the user include completeness S,,,., average delay S,,,, and degree of cor-

suc

relation S..1.

tasks h,; and p (Eq. (4)) is the attenuation factor. It is an amount that dynamically attenu-
ates over time. That is, the longer the interval, the lesser the influence of users’ degree of

correlation on service decisions.

Operation behavior

Definition 5 Operation behaviors are users’ operation process in social networks. This
study uses the user-intentional serialization algorithm based on situational analysis pro-
posed in [12] to analyze the SocialSitu(t) sequence of users’ operation behaviors which
draws out their behavior patterns under different intentions (ie., frequent functional

experience).

SocialSitu(t): Indicates the situational information at time t. SocialSitu(t) is a tetrad,
SocialSitu(t) = {ID, d, A, E}, where d represents users’ intentions at time ¢ (desire), A indi-

cates users’ operations (i.e., behavior) corresponding to d at this moment, E represents

the environmental information, including terminal devices and location information,
and JD represents users’ identity information, including users’ crowds and their roles

played in the crowds.

Coincidence degree

Definition 6 Coincidence degree aims is to evaluate the consistency of the results
returned by individual and overall users, as shown in Eq. (5), where R,, is the rating
of task t by user i and R; is the average rating of task t by overall users. Therefore, the
higher the coincidence degree is, the more consistent the rating of the user with overall

users is.
Cit) = [Rit —Re | (5)

User-task-suitability

Definition 7 User-task-suitability is how well a user performs a task. Suitability is cal-
culated from the attributes and weights corresponding to the three task assign factors,
namely, degree of completion, service response time, the degree of correlation, opera-
tion behaviors, and coincidence. Equation (6) shows that the greater the suitability, the
more suitable the user is for this task. Accordingly, wi represents the jth attribute of user
i, @it represents the weight of the jth attributes of user i for task t, and p is the number of

attributes. The specific weights of attributes are detailed in the next section.

Establishment of task assign hierarchy

Hierarchy structure To determine the appropriate user for a task, users’ various attrib-
utes should be considered. First, the issue should be organized and the corresponding
hierarchy allocation system should be established, which includes the target, criterion
and attribute layer. Thereafter, the attributes of each layer are further analyzed. The target
layer aims to determine the crowd that is most suitable for a certain task. The criterion
layer is the criterion for finding crowd users (i.e., factors that affect task assignment). The
attribute layer is the attributes that make up each criterion layer factor. Figure 3 shows the

hierarchical assignment structure.

Constructing judgment matrix at each layer Before using FAHP to determine the weight
of each attribute, the importance of each layer’s attributes is expressed by fuzzy triangular

numbers @j; = (lj, mij, uj) and a fuzzy reciprocal judgment matrix

rocal numbers are used as scales to determine the value of lj, mj, uj, where /j;, mj and
uj are the lower, the mean and the upper bounds of a triple (Ji, mj, uj), respectively.
Hence, a relatively important standard seventeen meter is introduced when comparing

the importance of each attribute using FAHP (Table 1).

Determination of weights and consistency check Given that the fuzzy judgment matrix
A-B is reciprocal one, the non-linear programming modification of the Fuzzy Prefer-
ence Programming (FPP) method that only rely on the elements of the upper right
part for matrix A—B is used to estimate weights (Formula (7)). In formula (7), 2 can
be notated as the value of the consistency index and each w; be expressed as weight of

attribute.

The detailed steps in obtaining weights of attributes are as follows.

1. The optimal solution (A*, w*) of non-linear program problem for the formula (7)
which includes one equality and six inequality constraints is solved.
2. The ratios of the acquired weights are calculated. If all solution ratios roughly sat-

isfy the double-side inequalities, i.e. ljj<—>%<uj, so the initial fuzzy judgements are

agreeable. If not, the fuzzy judgment is unreasonable.

3. The fuzzy judgements consistency is validated. If the optimal value 4* is positive,
the consistency of fuzzy judgments is acceptable. Otherwise, these judgements are
strongly inconsistent so that the fuzzy judgment matrix should be modified appro-
priately. Consistency detection prevents inaccurate weights because of subjective
factors.

4. Lastly, by calculating the weight of each attribute in attribute layer C relative to target
layer A, Suitability can be further calculated and the task can be assigned thereafter.

Table 2 shows the weight values.

Task assignment algorithm of user task suitability based on SocialSitu
Data preprocessing
When a task publisher submits crowd tasks to crowd computing platforms, the quan-
tity may be large and varied. Therefore, tasks submitted by the publisher should be pro-
cessed into certain task types that can be handled by crowd computing platforms.

The daily data of user logs in online social networks are irregular and incomplete. First,
data preprocessing should convert these irregular data into data formats that can be rec-

ognized by the proposed algorithm. The possible steps are as follows.

1. Data cleaning: Useless and cluttered data are eliminated.

2. Data identification: This step comprises two parts: user identification and full session
identification (i.e., to crowd data and select each user’s completed session records).

3. Data conversion: Data are converted into formats that can be recognized by the pro-

posed algorithm.

Specific steps of algorithm

The key issue in this study is how to accurately and efficiently assign suitable tasks
to online social users. The main ideas are as follows: (1) use the SocialSitu(t) theory
to obtain behavioral patterns under different intentions by analyzing the SocialSitu(t)
sequence of users’ behaviors, (2) find user crowd L, with relevant functional experi-
ence and calculate user task suitability, and (3) sort tasks by suitability based on the
required number of users to form assignment collection L,. The assign algorithm is
shown, where SituBehaviorAnlytics (DS, Min_Support, G) function refers to analysis
of user behavior patterns under different intents, DS is user operation behavior data
set, Min_Support is minimum support, and G is users’ intentions. Figure 3 shows the

algorithm process. The specific steps of the algorithm are as follows.

1. Input task collection T and user collection U. Traverse unaccomplished task list
T= {t,, ty ... t} and user list U={uj, uy, ... uj}, and obtain task t; and information of
user Uj.

2. ‘The situation information A of u, is analyzed and processed and the behavior
sequence patterns of user u, are obtained through the user behavior pattern discov-
ery algorithm SituBehaviorAnalytics(DS, Min_Support, G).

3. If the behavior sequence patterns of user u; match the category @ of uncompleted
task t,, then the id of user u, is stored in user collection L, of the unallocated tasks.

4. Suitability of user collection L, for task t; is calculated Sy, ti; and is sorted from high
to low.

5. The previous 6 user is selected and stored in user collection L,.

6. Assign tasks to users in collection L,.

7. Repeat steps 1 to 6 until there are no newer unassigned tasks. And the detailed algo-

rithm process is shown in Algorithm 1 and Fig. 4.

Experimental setup and analysis

The purpose of crowd task assignment is to obtain large-scale user computing resources in

an online social environment. To verify the validity and correctness of the proposed algo-

rithm, it is compared with two typical and popular algorithms, namely, random algorithm

and algorithm based on user theme awareness. Random algorithm is currently the most

popular allocation algorithm, which is easy to operate, has short time consumption, and

is extensively used. Task assign algorithm based on user theme awareness detects users’
themes by analyzing users’ historical data to assign tasks. However, both algorithms have

problems with inaccurate assignment.

Experimental environment

To analyze the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the self-developed
technology social platform Shareteches (formerly CyVOD) [35] (http://www.shareteche
s.com) and its mobile applications are used as experimental platforms to conduct experi-
ments and data analysis. The web server is used as task publisher and the client is used as

mobile.

Experimental design

Social networks have gained widespread attention, and have been extensively applied as
platforms for people to spread information on the Internet and conduct social exchange
activities.

At present, security and privacy issues of social network platforms highlight the urgent
need for social network users to assess platform functionality, security precautions, privacy
protection, and other features [36]. According to the prevailing security and privacy issues
in current social networks [37-39], this study designs seven assessment tasks of social net-
working platforms and evaluates security trust, functionality, and other aspects of social
networking platforms. The details of crowd assessment information are showed in Table 3.
In the course of the experiment,all the participants who come from Shareteches consist of
ordinary users and expert users. Moreover, these users have experience of using this social
networks platform and are able to perform better when they operate these assessment

tasks.

Analysis of experimental results

Precision, recall, F-measure, and degree of competition are used as evaluation indicators of
the algorithm. Precision and recall are two extensively used measures to assess the quality
of returned results. Precision is the ratio of returned correct results to all returned results
and measures the accuracy of task assignment. Recall refers to the ratio of the correct num-
ber of returned results to the total number of assignment and measures the coverage of task
assignment. F-measure is the harmonic average of precision and recall. Degree of comple-
tion is the ratio of the number of returned results to the total number of assignment. We
here use Ru to represent the total number of results for user u and Tu represents the total
number of user u task assignments. Therefore, the formulas and notations for evaluation

factors such as Precision, recall and F-measure are expressed as follows:

R, OT.
Precision = dou Ru 0 Tul (8)

Algorithm correctness analysis

To reflect the correctness of proposed algorithm, it is used to assign 7 types of tasks
about the security and privacy to 300 users of the social platform Shareteches. The pre-
cision and recall are shown in Fig. 5a, b. The figure shows that the precision is mainly
stable between 0.60 and 0.70 and the recall is stable between 0.80 and 0.90. The F-meas-
ure is shown in Fig. 5c, which shows that the F-measure is mainly stable between 0.7 and
0.75.

Algorithm validity analysis

Task assignment was performed using random assignment, theme-aware assignment, and
proposed algorithms. Precision, recall, and F-measure comparisons are shown in Fig. 6a—c.
Given the increase of users, the precision and recall of the proposed and random assign-
ment algorithms are gradually increasing and tend to be stable. Precision and recall of the
theme-aware algorithm are slightly decreased and eventually tend to be stable. The pre-
cision of proposed algorithm is mainly stable at approximately 0.6, while recall is stable
between 0.8 and 0.9. Both are higher than the other two algorithms. When the number of
assigned users reaches 300, the F-measure of the proposed algorithm is approximately 0.3
and 0.5 higher than the other two algorithms, respectively. Moreover, the proposed algo-
rithm has evident advantages in terms of timeliness. Figure 6d shows that the completeness
of the three algorithms increases as the delay increases. The degree of completion of the

proposed algorithm is higher than that of the other two algorithms with the same delay.

Conclusion

To accurately and efficiently assign assessment tasks about the security and trustworthi-
ness of online social networks to social users, this study defined task assign factors and
their attributes and user tasks suitability by analyzing users’ situational information and
historical records. Accordingly, this research designed a task assign method of crowd
assessment for online social networks and proposed a task assign algorithm based on
human-centric computational abstraction SocialSitu theory. Crowd assessment experi-
ments were conducted on a real world social network Shareteches. The experimental
results showed that the proposed method not only achieves both validity and effective-
ness, but also further improves the security and trustworthiness for online social net-
works. In the further, we firstly mine more effective task allocation factors based on
users’ social behavior characteristics and content characteristics. Then, we further com-
bine machine learning method with crowdsourcing theory to complete the security and
trustworthiness assessment of social network platform.
