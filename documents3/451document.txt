Poor selection of footwear, underestimation of foot health, sedentary life, and lack of accessible foot
screening can have significant long-term adverse effects on the health of lower limbs. Unobtrusive, per-
vasive methods for automated foot screening have the potential to allow for timely detection of foot
abnormalities. In the present study, we describe a proof-of-concept where data collected through
sensor-enabled insoles and processed through one-dimensional convolutional neural networks were
used to distinguish normal, cavus, and planus feet. We explored several combinations of sensor modal-
ities to find the one that reflects foot types optimally. The highest accuracy of classification of 99.26% was
achieved when angular velocity and force sensing were combined. Based on results, we suggest that

1. Introduction

According to the structure of the foot arch, there are three types
of feet: normal, planus, and cavus foot. The planus foot exhibits a
wholly or partly collapsed arch, whereas cavus foot characterizes
with a high longitudinal arch. Both of these abnormal foot types
are highly prevalent. The proportion of the population with flat feet
is about 2.2% among all age groups |1]. The low arch foot is found
in 10.3% of the population in the age range 7-14 [2]. The preva-
lence of cavus foot is about 10.5% in the age group 16-65 years
[3]. Due to the gait alteration that occurs as a result of these foot
deformities, they are also associated with a higher incidence of
lower limb injuries and increased risk for the development of med-
ial tibial stress syndrome and patellofemoral pain [4]. Individuals
with cavus foot may have unstable gait, ankle sprains, or pain in
the metatarsal heads [6]. With the progression of the cavus foot
condition, surgery will be necessary [5]. In the case of inappropri-
ately selected shoes or foot orthotics, the condition of feet and
ankles will worsen [7].

Determining foot status requires morphological measurement,
which typically involves anthropometric methods, visual inspec-
tion, footprint measurement, and radiographic evaluation [8].
When applying such techniques, the validity of the measurement
heavily depends on the experience of the podiatrist or orthopedist.
Also, despite its diagnostic value, X-ray imaging of the foot is not

appropriate for screening due to the associated radiation exposure.
Specialized systems for gait analysis, such as force plates [9], plan-
tar pressure platforms | 10], and motion capturing systems using a
camera and optical makers [11], allow for accurate classification or
clustering of the foot types. For instance, a camera-based Vicon MX
Motion Capture System was used to evaluate the effect of foot
orthoses for the correction of flexible flat foot [12]. The 3D foot
shape, acquired using a 3D laser scanner, can also indicate the loca-
tion and severity of abnormal foot regions | 13].

However, these are stationary systems confined to use in labo-
ratory settings and not being suitable for mass foot screening and
long-term monitoring. Therefore, new types of devices are needed
to serve such purposes. Our primary concern behind conducting
this research was to design and validate a method for unobtrusive
screening and monitoring of foot function based on a sensor-
enabled insole. In the current study, we integrated inertial sensor
and force sensors into an insole. In this design, the inertial sensor
allows acquiring the kinematic information, and the force sensors
capture the kinetic information. The fusion of those two kinds of
information allows reflecting the motion characteristics of each
foot type entirely. Besides, our design involves wearable system
technology. It thus facilitates experiments outside laboratories, in
natural daily life settings, that are very close to the real conditions
of mass screening of the foot types.

Gait analysis takes place for analysis of locomotion ability,
clinical evaluation, and monitoring of the daily activities of the
patients [14]. For the sensing, force sensors, and inertial sensors
incorporating accelerometer and gyroscope are typically used.

Features can be explicitly defined, i.e., handcrafted, or, when using
the latest machine learning approaches, be automatically deter-
mined. While conventional machine learning methods heavily
depend on the handcrafted features, the latter might not reflect
essential characteristics appropriately and thus lead to bias and
lower the performance of the classifier. Recently, one-
dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN) have gained
popularity for their unprecedented ability to extract discriminative
features from raw data automatically. They have successfully been
applied for human activity recognition [15], extraction of gait
parameters |16], and classification of gait type [18]. In the present
study, we hypothesized that during the foot motion, each foot type
exhibits characteristic “marks” in the sensor signals. To explore the
validity of this assumption empirically, we developed a full wear-
able gait analysis framework. It involves a multi-modal sensor
insole for signal collection and a set of 1D-CNNs neural networks
for automatic classification of foot types. Our aims were:

(1) To prove whether our designed sensor insole could serve
foot type classification.

(2) To construct 1D-CNNs, optimize the network parameters,
and compare the performance of the classifiers constructed
using individual modalities and combinations of sensor data.

(3) Based on the performance comparison, to determine the
optimal sensor configuration that would allow for a high
accuracy while using a lower volume of gait data.

(4) To challenge the benefits of deep learning methods for foot
type classification by comparing them with conventional
machine learning methods.

The rest of this work is organized as follows: In Section 2, the
related works on foot type evaluation and classification are intro-
duced. Section 3 provides information about the design of the cus-
tom smart insole and the acquisition of experimental data. The
algorithms used in this work are described in Section 4. In Sec-
tion 5, the results of the algorithms and performance comparison
are presented. Discussion and conclusion are given in Sections 6
and Section 7, respectively.

2. Related work

Each foot type is associated with a specific locomotion pattern.
The exploration of the motion characteristics of each foot type
allows building methods for automatic recognition of the foot type.
Technically, the data required for such analyses are obtained
through plantar pressure measurement systems, force plates, and
optoelectronic motion capture systems.

Based on a plantar pressure measurement system emed®-x 400,
Buldt et al. [19] found that the lowest average and minimum cen-
ter of pressure (CoP) velocity during the terminal stance phase
were lower in cavus foot compared to planus foot. Cavus foot
had the highest maximum CoP velocity during the pre-swing
stance [19]. The planus foot had the smallest index range of
lateral-medial force during the terminal phase | 19]. Among normal
foot, planus foot and cavus foot, the cavus foot exhibited the high-
est center of pressure excursion index (CPEI); the planus foot
showed the smallest CPEI values, and the normal foot exhibited
the lowest peak pressure | 17]. The peak pressures under the fourth
and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints of the planus foot are lower
than the ones of normal foot and cavus foot [29]. In previous stud-
ies, the stability of planus and normal feet was evaluated based on
kinetic data from force plates. The force under the first hallux of
pes planus is higher than that of normal foot [23]. In that, signifi-
cant differences were found upon quantification through sample
entropy [21], CoP velocity, and total velocity [22]. Based on mea-

surements with an insole pressure system Pedar-X, it was deter-
mined that the contact area in the medial midfoot, as well as the
maximum force and peak pressure in the lateral forefoot, are dif-
ferent between the normal foot and planus foot [20].

Kerr et al. [32] captured motion data using a tracking system
with reflective markers and infrared cameras. They found differ-
ences in the inversion-eversion of the hindfoot and abduction-ad-
duction of the forefoot between symptomatic and asymptomatic
flat feet. Also, Buldt et al. [27] analyzed kinematic data captured
from a camera-based motion capture system using optical mark-
ers, and found that during initial contact and mid-stance the cavus
foot exhibited less motion in the sagittal and transverse planes;
also, lower midfoot range of motion during the pre-swing of planus
foot. Kruger et al. [28] also analyzed the kinematic characteristics
of foot and ankle among normal, planus, and cavus feet. For that,
the differences in the tibial angle, hindfoot angle, and forefoot
angle were observed among the three foot types throughout the
gait cycle. Differences were also found in the coronal forefoot
angular velocity.

As to the automatic classification of the foot types based on
plantar sensing, some progress has already been made through sta-
tionary devices. Barton et al. [24] classified foot types into normal
foot, cavus foot, and hallux valgus using the maximum pressure
during the stance phase. Xu et al. [25] extracted from plantar pres-
sure four foot-arch indexes as features: Staheli index, Chippaux-
Smirak index, arch index, and modified arch index. They used a
classifier combining fuzzy logic and neural network to classify
cavus foot and planus foot. Ramirez-Bautista et al. [48] divided
the plantar pressure area into fourteen sub-areas, including five
toes, five metatarsal heads, lateral and medial midfoot, and lateral
and medial heel. Cavus foot and planus foot were classified by the
use of fuzzy cognitive maps with a genetic algorithm for weight
learning. For the classification of the normal foot and flexible pla-
nus foot based on the ground reaction force, Bertani et al. [9| used
a heuristic optimization technique named Discard-Insert-Exchange
to extract the most discriminative features automatically. In this
method, three linear discriminative functions (LDEs) were used,
where each function maps one of the GRF components in the form
of a one-dimensional feature vector. A fourth LDF was used to
obtain the final foot type classification result. Bohm et al. | 11] used
principal component analysis to extract the three independent
eigenvectors from the kinematic data of flexible flatfoot. Then,
the K-means algorithm was applied to cluster transformed data
into two types of flexible flatfoot. In this process, the inversion data
during the push-off phase were the most discriminant. Table 1
contains a list of the main works dedicated to foot type classifica-
tion using gait analysis devices.

So far, there was no study to classify foot types using inertial
sensing. However, some authors studied the locomotion character-
istics of each foot type, Grech et al. [26] found that there was a sig-
nificant difference in the acceleration at heal strike between cavus
foot and normal foot, as well as between cavus foot and planus
foot. In another study [31], no difference was found in the acceler-
ation between the normal foot and planus foot. Also, in a compar-
ison between cavus foot and planus foot difference was observed
in forefoot adduction excursion and forefoot abduction velocity
[30].

The above studies of motion patterns of each foot type confirm
that foot types can be differentiated based on kinematic and
kinetic characteristics. We thus hypothesized that obtaining those
two kinds of information would allow for foot type screening.
Hence, in this study, we suggest a proof-of-concept of a wearable
system with integrated inertial and force sensors that can provide
kinematic and kinetic information of foot motion, respectively. In
previous studies, one-dimensional convolutional neural network
(1D-CNN) has been successfully applied for processing motion sen-

sor time-series, in, e.g., golf swing classification [33], automatic
detection of freezing gait of Parkinson disease |34]| and real-time
activity classification [35]. CNNs outperform conventional machine
learning methods based on handcrafted features thanks to their
ability to automatically extract features from the low to the high
level of representation. Based on this evidence, we considered
combining the wearable gait analysis system with a 1D CNN for
the extraction of discriminative features. The suggested concept
could eventually reflect the functional differences among the three
types of foot. In practice, such systems could allow for real-time
monitoring of foot status and early warning of foot deformities.
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed concept is the first
one for foot type classification based on a wearable system.

3. Experimental platform and data acquisition
3.1. Experimental platform

For the present study, we developed a full data acquisition
framework, including a custom sensor insole. Fig. 1 illustrates the
prototype of the insole and its main components.

The device incorporates nine force sensors of type FlexiForce
A301 (Tekscan, Inc., USA) and an inertial sensor of type BMI160
(Bosch Sensortec GmbH). Force sensors were attached to a thin
and flexible printed circuit board and located under the main
weight-bearing areas of the foot, namely the hallux, five metatarsal
heads, lateral midfoot, the lateral heel and medial heel. The inertial
sensor contains a three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. All sen-
sor signals were sampled at 100 Hz, a rate acceptable when the

locomotion type is walking at normal speed. The electronic control
board, also holding the inertial sensor, was attached to the top of
the shoe over the forefoot area. Force sensors allowed capturing
kinetic information; inertial sensor provided kinematic informa-
tion. The combination of the two modalities was expected to offer
the highest accuracy of foot type classification. Sensor data were
transferred wirelessly using Bluetooth technology to a custom
receiver connected to a personal computer. Detailed information
about the developed insole can be found in [36,37].

3.2. Data acquisition

The data collection procedure was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Each subject was informed about
the experimental procedure, and his/her agreement to participate
in the experiment was obtained. A total of 80 subjects were
recruited for the experiment. Only data of the left feet were pro-
cessed in this study. Among all subjects, there were 44 subjects
with normal feet, 16 with planus feet, and 20 with cavus feet.
The type of each foot was determined and labeled by a podiatrist.
Subjects’ demographics data are listed in Table 2. Subjects with
pain or injury in a foot, ankle, or knee, or who underwent surgery
in these areas within the last six months before the data collection,
were not recruited. Before the experiment, each subject was
informed about the experimental procedure and asked to fill out
a questionnaire about age, gender, height, weight, and health sta-
tus related to the locomotor function. The latter required reporting
of pain in the heel, mid-foot, forefoot or hallux, or problems in the
back, knee, or hip, as well as a history of falls. For each foot, photos

were taken of the medial longitudinal arch to examine the arch,
and of the heel and tibia to examine the foot alignment during sta-
tic standing. Each subject wore shoes with inserted sensor soles of
an appropriate size. Data were acquired while each subject walked
straight over a 7-meter walkway completing in this way seven or
eight steps until arriving at the end of the walkway. Each trial cov-
ered the phases of gait initiation, gait stabilization, and gait termi-
nation. We hypothesized that collected data contain discriminative
information for foot type classification. During the test, sudden
changes in the gait were not allowed. Each subject performed
approximately twenty trials. The data of some trials were consid-
ered invalid due to operator or subject mistakes. After discarding
invalid trials, the data of 1488 trials were deemed valid. These
included 827 records of normal feet, 343 of cavus feet, and 318 pla-
nus feet records. The experimental configuration is illustrated in
Fig. 2. The waveforms of a valid representative trial are shown in

the benefits of the CNNs: the local connection, shared weights,
pooling, and the use of multiple layers [38]. The typical structure
of a CNN involves stacked convolutional layers, a pooling layer,
and fully connected layers. Each convolutional layer represents a
feature abstraction in space and/or time domain of the input data
or the previous feature maps. The stacked convolutional layers lead
to progressively extracted feature maps from the low-level
abstraction to the high-level ones. Each pooling layer downsam-
ples the features from the preceding maps without loss of informa-
tion and, thus, reduces the dimension of the preceding map. Max
pooling is generally used [38]. The activation function performs
the non-linear mapping from the output of the previous neuron
of the convolutional layer; this allows the network to learn a com-
plex model [39]. Non-saturated activation functions, e.g., rectified
linear unit (ReLU), which solve exploding or vanishing gradient,
and speed up convergence, are widely used in deep learning [40].
To determine the appropriative activation function, several satu-
rated activation functions, including ReLU, Leaky ReLU (LReLU),
parametric ReLU (PReLU), randomized ReLU (RReLU), respectively,
were explored in this study.

In the present study, to address the problem of the covariate
shift, batch normalization was used in the 1D CNN architecture.
The normalization accelerates the speed of network training and
relieves the need to take care of the parameter initialization [41].

4,2. The proposed architecture

The basic processing model (BPM) that defines the 1D CNN
architecture applied in this study is presented in Fig. 4 (a), and
we applied it for all variants of input data. Data were first normal-
ized with Z-scores and then fed to the corresponding BPM. Each
module consisted of two convolutional layers and one max pool
layer; each layer was followed by batch normalization and activa-
tion. The architecture of the 1D-CNN that fused all three modalities
is shown in Fig. 4(b). Four modules were stacked during the stage
of feature learning. Then the learned features from the three pipeli-
nes were concatenated and passed to a network consisting of a flat-
ten layer, two fully connected layers, and one softmax layer with
softmax activation. For every single type of data, there was no con-
catenating step for feature fusion.

We aimed to investigate which individual type of data and
which fusion scheme would serve foot type classification better.
For that purpose, we trained an individual model using accelera-
tion, angular velocity, and force data, respectively. Then, we
designed four feature fusion schemes: (1) acceleration and angular
velocity, (2) acceleration and force (3) angular velocity and force,
and (4) accelerometer, angular velocity, and force.

To find an appropriate pool size, we tested the sizes from 1 x 3
to 1 x 8. We also explored convolutional kernel sizes from 1 x 3 to
1 x 7, tested several activation functions, and batch sizes from 16
to 64 with an interval of 8. Because of the restricted computing
power, we were not able to find a global optimization of the
parameters and, as a workaround, adopted a greedy search. First,
we adjusted the convolutional kernel size; then, based on the opti-
mized kernel size, we adjusted the pool size. We adopted a similar
strategy to adjust the activation function and the batch size.

4.3. Model training

We trained each of the models for 100 epochs. Categorical
Cross-Entropy served as a loss function, and Adadelta optimizer
was applied to update the model parameters. A specific character-
istic of the Adadelta optimizer is that the learning rate decreases
monotonically with the progression of learning [42]. The accuracy
and loss of training and testing were saved for each epoch, and the
model of the last epoch was saved for the prediction.

5-fold cross-validation: To evaluate the generalization capabil-
ity of the 1D-CNNs and the conventional models for foot type clas-
sification, we performed a stratified 5-fold cross-validation, in
which each fold kept the same proportion of samples for each
given category. For that, all samples were partitioned into five sub-
sets. One subset of data was used to test the trained model; from
the rest subsets, 20% were used for validation and 80% for training.
This process was repeated five times until using each subset as a
test set. The performance of each classifier was evaluated based
on the resulting confusion matrix. For each confusion matrix, each
row represents the instances of the actual class, while each column
represents the ones of the predicted class. Four average metrics:
recall, precision, f-measure, and accuracy, obtained from the
matrix, were also used for evaluating the performance of the mod-
els. The 5-fold cross-validation was performed over each of the
input data variants.

4.4, Technical specification

The algorithm was implemented using Python 3.6 and Keras
2.2.4 with TensorFlow-GPU 1.12.0. It was executed on a computer
provided with Intel® Core (TM) i7-7800X CPU, 32 GB RAM, and

Windows 10. Additionally, a GPU NVIDIA TITAN Xp, with 12 GB
GDDR5X and 3840 cores was used to accelerate the processing.

4.5. Comparison with conventional machine learning methods

A third-order Butterworth low pass filter with a cutoff fre-
quency of 16 Hz was applied to each of the three types of data
[14]. The handcrafted features obtained from insole data were
the maximum, minimum, mean, range, zero-crossing rate, root-
mean-square value, variance, standard variance, skewness, and
kurtosis. For the comparison, in the role of conventional methods,
Random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree
were used to classify the foot types based on the handcrafted
features.

Random forest is an ensemble learning method suitable to pro-
cess foot motion data [44]. It consists of a collection of trees, each
of which builds on randomly sampled data that have the same sta-
tistical distribution as ones of all other trees in the forest. For clas-
sification in the forest tree, voting is typically used to determine
the class labels. We used a grid search to determine optimal values
of the number of trees, maximum depth, and the number of fea-
tures to split each node [47].

The SVM is a supervised machine learning technique. It is based
on the statistical learning theory of Vapnik—Chervonenkis dimen-
sion and structural risk minimization. An SVM constructs the
hyperplanes with maximum margin to separate the data into dif-
ferent classes |46]. A kernel function could be introduced to project
the data into a higher dimension, which allows making the data
linearly separable. Among kernel functions, SVM with radial basis
function showed the best accuracy in this study. The parameter
of the decision function shape was selected as “one against the
rest”. The parameters C and y of the SVM were explored using a

grid search. PCA was used to project the handcrafted features to
improve the performance of the SVM.

A decision tree is a tree-like classifier based on data partitioning
[45]. Each internal node splits the data into subsets according to
the features. Each edge represents the outcome of the partitioning.
Each leaf node represents a class label. The decision tree is an algo-
rithm that does not require domain knowledge or parameter set-
ting. It can handle different types of data without transformation,
and can also process multidimensional data. In this study, a grid
search was used to find the appropriate values for the maximum
depth and the number of features. The ranges of the hyper-
parameters for the three algorithms are provided in Table 3. All
the conventional machine learning algorithms used in the study
are a part of the Python library Scikit-learn 0.19.1.

5. Results

5.1. Parameter optimization

For finding the optimal parameters of the 1D CNNs, grid search
was performed, which started with defaults as follows: activation

function PReLU; kernel size, and pool size of 1 x 3; a batch size
of 32. We first searched the optimal kernel size with default set-
tings; then, using the optimal kernel size and default batch size
and activation function, we searched for the optimal pool size.
The rest parameters were optimized using similar steps. The opti-
mized parameters for all seven 1D CNN models that cover the three
types of individual data and the modality combinations are shown
in Fig. 5(a)-(d). The optimized parameters in the final models for
each type of data and the combination of the data are listed in
Table 4.

After the 5-fold cross-validation, the model built on accelera-
tion data had the following optimal parameters: convolutional ker-
nel size of 1 x 5, pool size of 1 x 7, ELU activation function, and a
batch size of 32. The best average accuracy of the model on the test
set reached 95.16%. The accuracy and loss on the training set and
validation set for acceleration data and optimized kernel size are
shown in Fig. 6(a)-(e).

ities, as well as their combinations, were used. SVM with PCA
showed the best performance among four methods with an aver-
age accuracy of 0.977 on Acc data, and 0.9885 on the combination
of Acc and force data, respectively. Random forest outperformed
other classifies with an average accuracy of 99.40 on all types of

6. Discussion

In this study, we proposed a set of 1D-CNNs to effectively clas-
sify three types of feet using acceleration, angular velocity, and
force data. Each type of data allows reaching an average accuracy
of over 95%. This result proves that the CNN model can extract
the most discriminative features from our insole data. However,
the performances of models constructed on different combinations
of sensor data were different. When used individually, force data
allowed achieving the best average accuracy. This result implies
that the forces acquired from the main anatomical positions of
the foot can serve as a reliable indicator of the differences in the
gait patterns among the three explored foot types. So far, foot type
classification was always based on analysis of plantar pressure dis-
tribution measured using force sensor arrays. Such an approach
requires large volumes of force sensor data to be collected, pro-
cessed and stored. Also, it is associated with a high cost of the data
collecting system, especially when compared with a portable
device with just a few force sensors. These conclusions are sup-

ported by Hsu et al. [43], where an ink footprint was compared
with low-spatial-resolution force sensor data, and a high correla-
tion was found for the medial arch in static testing and the lateral
arch in dynamic testing. However, the authors only found the sta-
tistical correlation, while no classifier was constructed.

As for the classification of foot types based on the acceleration
and angular velocity data, to our best knowledge, no study
explored this topic. In several studies [26,30,31], only statistical
difference was explored. However, those differences indicate that
the locomotion patterns of the foot types are different, and it is
possible to classify the foot types based on inertial data. The pre-
sent study confirms this assumption. Among classifiers con-
structed in this study, the models that combined features of
multiple types of data achieved better results. During a gait cycle,
the foot performs dorsiflexion/plantar flexion, eversion/inversion,
and abduction/adduction. The acceleration and angular velocities
reflect the kinematic characteristics of these motions, while the
force sensor indicates the vertical ground reaction force under
the main plantar areas. Each modality represents different motion
characteristics of the foot; thus, the fusion strategy allows obtain-
ing the highest number of discriminative features for best classifi-
cation performance.

For automatic classification of foot types, Xu et al. [25] used
adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system as a Classifier; they
extracted four kinds of arch indexes from plantar pressure and
used these as features; the obtained model reached an accuracy
of 95% for classification of planus and cavus feet. Also, Ramirez-
Z. Mei et al. / Measurement 165 (2020) 108184 11

Bautista et al. [48] divided the area of the plantar pressure into
fourteen sub-areas. To classify planus and cavus feet, they applied
Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with a genetic algorithm for weight learning
and achieved an accuracy of 91%. In this study, we classify foot
types into normal, cavus, and planus foot based on data collected
through our insole and classified using a 1D CNN. Through our
approach, we reached an accuracy of more than 99.26%. That result
was possible thanks to the integration of both inertial and force
sensors, which allows obtaining richer motion information in con-
trast with systems using solely plantar pressure. Besides, 1D CNN
offers the advantage of extracting discriminative features automat-
ically, in contrast to using hand-crafted features that might be sub-
optimal. A possible drawback of our solution in comparison with
traditional classification methods is that the classification algo-
rithm requires more computational power, especially in the train-
ing phase.

In the study, not all individual modality deep learning models
outperformed the conventional methods. One of the possible rea-
sons is that features that were automatically extracted by the
1D-CNNs were different from those used with the conventional
methods; the second possible reason lies in the differences in the
optimization methods. Because of the limitation of the computing
power of the station used to construct the deep learning models,
we adopted a greedy search approach that cannot guarantee an
optimal global result. For the three conventional methods, we used
a grid search for the essential parameters, and it was possibly bet-
ter than the greedy search. The third possible reason is that when
used deep learning methods, higher volumes of data are needed
since these methods rely on learning a high number of parameters,
typically exceeding one million. Another limitation is that the age
group of the subjects was restricted as all of them were university
students. In our future studies, more subjects covering all age
groups will be explored to allow for a better generalization ability
of the deep models.

7. Conclusions and future work

Collaborative advances in sensing and textiles pave the way of
smart footwear. One essential use of such technologies would be
the automatic early detection of foot abnormalities. It has the
potential to compensate for the lack of enough podiatrist resources
and difficulties to establish mass foot screening. So far, however,
little has been done to validate the feasibility of distinguishing foot
types based on a wearable device. To make a step towards filling
this gap, in this study, we used a custom, fully-featured framework
to collect and analyze walking data from normal, cavus, and planus
feet. It involved sensor insoles incorporating inertial and force sen-
sors for the signal collection and a set of 1D CNN models. For com-
parative evaluation of the 1D CNN model performance, three
conventional machine learning methods with handcrafted features
were also applied to classify foot types. Force data allowed for the
best performance compared with individually used acceleration
and angular velocity data. In most cases, combinations of force data
with one of the other two modalities allowed for a better result
than that of a single modality.

With the present study, we validate the feasibility of automatic
foot types classification through the use of a wearable system for
gait analysis. Because of factors including the up-until-recently-
limited availability of the required technologies to build unobtru-
sive and practical sensor-enabled footwear, applications of wear-
able system-based gait analysis are yet to make their way in
practice. Existing commercial sensor-enabled footwear products
mainly address diabetic foot monitoring, and fitness uses. In con-
trast, the concept we suggest could allow for real-time monitoring
of the foot function and early warning of foot deformities. Such

solutions are very needed as the in-lab mass screening is challeng-
ing to implement; on the other side, the target group of the pro-
posed system is individuals with limited access to regular
podiatrist care who need foot monitoring or those who are una-
ware of possible issues with their foot function. The first group is
usually represented by the elderly or patients who had surgery
or are under rehabilitation and need regular foot function monitor-
ing; also, the users of foot orthoses. On the other side, youngsters
are often unaware of possible issues with their foot function and
the necessary corrective measures. In that case, an early warning
would allow avoiding the long-term complications of untreated
foot deformity. Long-term observations of foot type could also con-
tribute to proper footwear selection.

As to the possible disadvantages of the proposed concept, these
are mostly related to the technical possibilities to build an unob-
trusive, convenient device with high user acceptance. We believe
that most of the technical challenges are solvable with the current
level of technologies, e.g., force sensors and matrices can be cus-
tomized relatively easily, and new force sensor materials are taking
place, such as graphene. Also, in this study, we propose a proof-of-
concept. However, for a real-world application, different technical
details and the system components are to be determined. For
instance, our current classification method is based on a 1D CNN
that may naturally be computationally heavy. In our future studies,
we need to test if the classification can be executed on a smart-
phone and whether models can be optimized for use in edge sys-
tems. If the processing is not possible locally, data need to be
transmitted to a cloud that will return the result of processing.
Then, in case of limited connectivity to servers, problems with
the real-time display of foot status may also arise.

In the near future, we are going to implement improvements in
both hardware and algorithmic aspects. At the system level, we are
going to increase the number of force sensors to obtain a more
detailed picture of dynamic plantar pressure patterns. With
increasing the number of sensors in the new design, the matter
of data volume optimization will become critical, which we will
address through the methods of compressive sensing. For the
research of foot types classification, we consider involving 3D force
and moments sensing such as Xsens ForceShoe; it will allow mea-
suring the foot and ankle motion in medial-lateral, fore-and-aft,
and vertical directions, thus contributing to obtaining a more dis-
criminative motion pattern. In terms of data processing and algo-
rithms, we will continue collecting and annotating foot type
data; with increasing the size of the training datasets, the general-
ization ability of trained models is expected to improve.

One of the open questions in both theoretical and practical
aspects of artificial intelligence methods is that the complex non-
linear models are viewed as_ black-box classifiers. Hence,
approaches are required to allow explaining the decisions of the
classifier and the contribution of each input variable to the classi-
fication output. In a theoretical aspect, such techniques will allow
for a more in-depth understanding of factors determining the clas-
sifier decisions; from a practical perspective, knowing which input
variables are most significant will make it possible to optimize the
whole pipeline from data collection at the sensor node to obtaining
the high-level classification result. In our future work, we will ana-
lyze factors determining classifier decision and the contribution of
input variables, applying techniques such as the Layer-Wise Rele-
vance Propagation [49].
