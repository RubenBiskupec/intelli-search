information on multimedia. Secret image sharing is just the most important extension
of secret sharing that can safely guard the secrecy of images among multiple
participants. On the other hand, cheating detection is an important issue in traditional
secret sharing schemes that have been discussed for many years. However, the issue of
cheating detection in secret image sharing has not been discussed sufficiently. In this
paper, we consider the cheating problem in the application of secret image sharing
schemes and construct a (k,n) secret image sharing scheme with the ability of
cheating detection and identification. Our scheme is capable of identifying cheaters
when k participants involve in reconstruction. The cheating identification ability and
size of shadow in the proposed scheme are improved from the previous cheating

1 Introduction

(k,n) secret sharing (SS) scheme was first proposed by Shamir [1] in 1979 to safeguard
secret information among a group of participants. In Shamir’s scheme, a secret s is divided
into 1 shares vj, V2,...,V, using a k — 1 degree polynomial in such a way that any k — 1
or less shares get no information about the secret s and any k or more shares can recon-
struct the secret s efficiently. In [2], the researchers designed reliable and secure devices
that can realize Shamir’s SS [1]. In 2002, Thien and Lin combined Shamir’s SS scheme
with image and proposed a secret image sharing (SIS) scheme [3] that can protect infor-
mation on secret image among multiple users. After years of research, many SIS schemes
were constructed, and all existing SIS schemes can be mainly divided into two cate-
gories: one is polynomial-based SIS schemes [4—6], and the other is visual cryptography
(VC)-based schemes [7—9]. Polynomial-based SIS schemes can reconstruct lossless image
with reduced shadow size; the image reconstruction in VC-based SIS schemes can be

simply accomplished by human visual system without any computation. However, the
reconstructed image is lossy and the size of shadow is expanded from the original image.

The cheating problem in SS schemes was first introduced by Tompa and Woll [10] in
1989. They considered the scenario that some dishonest participants (cheaters) pool fake
shares when reconstructing the secret. Through this method, the cheaters can get the
valid secret exclusively; the other honest participants can only decode a forged secret.
Many works have focused on solving cheating problem in SS schemes. Some of them [11-
13] were interested in detecting the cheating behavior, and others [14—16] focused on not
only detecting the cheating, but also identifying the cheaters. The cheating identifiable
schemes have stronger capability to resist cheating, and it results that the shares are larger
and the schemes are more complicated than those cheating detectable schemes.

As a result, the cheating problem is also an important issue in the field of SIS schemes.
However, this issue has not been discussed sufficiently in SIS so far. In the works [17-19],
some SIS schemes with steganography and authentication were capable of detecting or
identifying the cheating behavior. However, those SIS schemes were not based on Shamir’s
scheme and the capabilities of cheating detection or identification were not strong enough
to prevent the cheating. In [20], Liu et al. proposed a SIS with the capability of cheating
detection, but the identification of cheaters is still unknown. In [21], Yang et al. proposed
a SIS scheme that can identify cheaters during reconstruction. In their scheme, shadows
are generated from bivariate polynomial and each shadow has extra bits which is used
for authentication. The cheating identification is based on the property of symmetry in
bivariate polynomial; however, the power on identifying cheaters in [21] is limited.

In this paper, we focus on the cheating problem in the fundamental polynomial-based
SIS [3]. Since cheating identifiable scheme has much stronger power to prevent cheating
behavior, we construct a (k,1) SIS scheme capable of identifying up to |S? | cheaters.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some related
works, which includes Shamir’s (k,) SS scheme, polynomial-based SIS scheme, and the
model of cheating identification in SS scheme. In Section 3, we construct a (k,1) SIS
scheme capable of cheating identification, and the theoretical analysis is also provided in
this section. In Section 4, we use an example to illustrate the cheating identification in the
proposed scheme and give a comparison between the scheme in [21] and the proposed
scheme. Section 5 gives the conclusion of this paper.

2.1 Shamir’s (k,n) SS scheme

A (k,n) SS scheme is an approach where a secret is decrypted into 1 shares, in such way
that any k or more shares can reconstruct the secret and fewer than k shares get nothing
about the secret. More formally, in secret sharing scheme, there exist 1 participants P =
{P 1, Po,...,Py,} and a dealer D. A (k, 1) secret sharing scheme consists of two phases:

1 Sharing phase: During this phase, the dealer D divides the secret s into n shares
V1, V2)... V, and sends each share v; to a participant Pj.

2 Reconstruction phase: During this phase, a group of at least k participants submit
their shares to reconstruct the secret.

In the sharing phase, the dealer D computes shares in such a way that satisfies the

following conditions:
Zheng et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:42 Page 3 of 10

1 Correctness: Any set of at least k shares can reconstruct the valid secret.
2 Secrecy: Any fewer than k shares have no information about the secret.

Shamir’s (k, 2) SS scheme is shown in the following Scheme 1.

Scheme 1: Shamir’s (k,n) SS scheme
Sharing phase:

1 The dealer D chooses a k — 1 degree polynomial w(x) € GF(qg)[X] which
satisfies s = (0) € GF(q).

2 The dealer D computes n shares v; = w(i),i = 1,2...,n, and sends each
share v; to a participant Pj.

Reconstruction phase:

1 m(=k) participants (say P1, P2...,P,) submit their shares vq, v2..., Vin
together.

2 Computing the interpolated polynomial W(x) on V1, V..., Vz by the
equation: p(x) = >i", (vi Lusi =H), Then the secret s = (0).

2.2 Cheating identification in SS scheme

Tompa and Woll [10] first introduced the cheating problem in secret sharing schemes, for
instance, some cheaters submit fake shares during the reconstruction phase, which makes
the honest participants reconstruct a forged secret and the cheaters can get the real secret
exclusively. Cheating identification is a strong strategy to resist such cheating. The model
of cheating identifiable secret sharing scheme is shown as follows:

Sharing phase: During this phase, the dealer D divides the secret s into n shares
V1, V9.... V, and sends each share v; to a user Pj.

Reconstruction phase: During this phase, a group of m users (m > k) submit their
shares to reconstruct the secret.

1 A public cheating identification algorithm is applied on these m shares to
identify cheaters.

2 Let L be the set of users who are identified to be cheaters using cheating
identification algorithm.
If (m — |L|) > k, reconstruct the secret s from those shares of users who
are not in L, and output (s, L);
If (m — |L|) < k, output L.

2.3. Polynomial-based SIS

In [3], Thien and Lin proposed a remarkable (k, 7) SIS which was based on Shamir’s SS
scheme. An image O is made up of multiple pixels, and the gray value of each pixel is in
GF(251). In fact, the range of gray scale is [ 0, 255]; for each pixel larger than 250, they are
replaced by the value 250. Therefore, the reconstructed image would be of a little quality
distortion from the original image. However, in majority cases, this quality distortion can
be omitted with large number of pixels in an image. If all the pixels in an image are treated
as secrets, a polynomial-based SIS can be extended from Shamir’s SS. Thien-Lin’s SIS
scheme consists of two phases: shadow generation phase and image reconstruction phase.

In the shadow generation phase, a dealer regards a secret image O as input and outputs

n shadows §}, S9...,S,; during image recovery phase, any set of m shadows k < m < n

reconstruct the secret image O.

It is obvious that Scheme 2 satisfies the k-threshold property: k or more shadows can

reconstruct entire image; less than k shadows get nothing about secret image. The size of

each shadow in Scheme 2 is i times of the original image.

3 Methods
In this section, we consider the cheating problem in Scheme 2 and then proposed a cheat-

ing identifiable SIS that has the ability of identifying cheaters; then, the theoretical analysis

is discussed to prove the correctness of the proposed work.

3.1

The proposed scheme

Suppose that during the image reconstruction phase, cheaters can submit forged shadows.

It results that the honest participants can only get a fake secret image, while the cheaters

can even reconstruct the secret image exclusively. In order to prevent this problem, we

construct a (k,m) SIS with cheating identification under the model in Section 2.2. Our

scheme is based on Thien-Lin’s fundamental scheme which can be also extended in other

polynomial-based SIS schemes. Our scheme is shown in the following Scheme 3.

In Thien-Lin’s scheme, it can be noticed that the size of the shadow is i times of the

secret image. In our scheme, the pixel-share y,; = (mi;; d; i) are generated from each

k + w-pixels block; therefore, the size of the shadow in our scheme is a times of

the secret image O. The most complicated operation of cheating identification in our

scheme is computing cert polynomials with w — 1 degree; thus, the time complexity is

O (cet! «o?),
Zheng et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:42 Page 6 of 10

Observing that in the proposed scheme, each block of the secret image is shared using
Shamir’s (k, 1) secret sharing scheme. Therefore, our proposed scheme is a perfect (k, 1)
threshold scheme, namely, k or more shadows can reconstruct the image, while k — 1 or
less shadows get no information about the image.

3.2. Theoretical analysis

The capability of cheating identification of the proposed scheme is summarized by the
following lemma and theorem. Since in our scheme, the secret image is divided into mul-
tiple blocks and each block is encrypted into shares using the same approach, we use one
block of k+u pixels instead of the entire image to analyze its cheating identification ability.

Lemma 1 Sharing a (k+ w)-pixel block B = (do, aq, «... Ak—1 D0; D4, «.. bw_1) as shown in
Scheme 2, any w + 1 participants can get y and w — 1 degree polynomial n(x). The dealer
D decides the parameters of n(x). (n(x) = yg(*) + W(x), any w + 1 participants can get
n(x) and y without acknowledgment on w(x) and y(x)) but w participants are unable to
get any information about y and n(x).

Proof Supposing @ + 1 participants are Pj, Po,...,Py41, respectively, and they
possess w + 1 pixel-shares, vy; = {mj,dj},i = 1,2,..,@ + 1. The wm +
1 points (1,m),(2,mp2),...(@+1,m+41) determine an interpolated polynomial
w (x). And another interpolated polynomial y (x) is determined by w + 1 points
(1, d,), (2,d2),..,(@ + 1,dy41). A conclusion can be made easily, w + 1 points
(1,1), (2,2), ....(@ +1,Mw+1) are linear independent; otherwise, the interpolated
polynomial on (1, 7m), (2, m2),..., (k, mp) would be less than k — 1, since the n points
(1, m1), (2, m2), .... (k, mz) deduce a interpolated polynomial with k — 1 degree w(x) and
k>@+1.So, w (x) and yp (x) are both w-degree interpolated polynomials.

Now, we have n(x) = yy(«) +W(@) and 9 (x) = W (a) +7 9 (x). Let R(x) = n(x) —n (@).
Therefore, we get:

Ra) = Ve) —v @®) + yo) —y¢ @). (1)

We get w(i) = Ww (i), i = 1,2,...,.@ + 1, since w(x) and w(x) must pass through
(i,mj),i = 1,2,...,@+1. Similarly, we get y(i) = yp (i),i = 1,2,..,@+1. Together with Eq.
(1), we can get that R(i) = (y — y’) po (i),i = 1,2,...,@ + 1, which means that R(x) inter-

sects (y — y’) y (x) at w + 1 points, since both R(x) and (y — y’) y (x) are of degree no
more than w.

Thus, we get a conclusion that:
R@) = (y — y') g (x). (2)

Obviously, R(x) = n(x)— n (x), where R(x) is an interpolated polynomial, and the degree
which is no more than w — 1. Similarly, the y (x) is of degree w exactly. Therefore, we get
that y = y and n (x) = n(x). Otherwise, it would contradict to Eq. (2).

Next, we prove that y and n(x) cannot be gotten by w shareholders. The g(x) is depen-
dent with w(x), such that there exists a w — 1 degree polynomial n(x) and a value y, which
satisfies n(x) = w(x) + ygy(x). If we consider the w coefficients of n(x) and the value y as
w + 1 unknowns, then each participant P; can build a linear equation n(i) = m; + y-d;
on these m + 1 unknowns using their share (mj, d;). As a result, @ participants can build
Zheng et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:42 Page 7 of 10

w linear equations on these @ + 1 unknowns. These w + 1 unknowns cannot be figured
out, according to the property of linear equations. Otherwise, by using their w shares, w
participants can only get two w — 1-th degree interpolated polynomials w (x) and @ (x).
n(x) and y can be denoted as

n(x) =yo (x) + (x). (3)

However, 7)(x), we (x) and o. (x) are w — 1-degree interpolated polynomials. According
to Eq. (3), with probabilities a each element e in GF(p) could be y. Therefore, y and n(x)
cannot be gotten by w shareholders. End proof.

O

Theorem 1 [f the number t of cheaters satisfies t < w = | 4s? |, these cheaters can be

identified in the proposed scheme.

Proof According to Lemma 1, y and n(x) can be obtained by w + 1 cheaters using their
valid pixel-shares. Among these cheaters, the P; is a critical cheater, which can even forge
his pixel-share v; = (m, d,) where m; # m; to satisfy m+y- d, = n(j). Each combination
of w + 1 submitted pixel-shares including vj deduces an identical checking polynomial
n(x), during secret reconstruction and cheater identification, the cheater P; succeeds in
cheating.

As illustrated in Lemma 1, when t < w = | |, w cheaters can get no information
about y. Thus, forged shares cannot be made successfully by any a or less cheaters, to
avoid identification. A checking polynomial can be generated by any w + 1 participants,

according to Lemma 1, andt < w = | 45? There are w + 2 valid shares selected from

k submitted shares at least. Cor) = w + 2 valid checking polynomials can be generated
in CI. Without loss of generality, supposing P, is a critical cheater who releases a forged
pixel-share Vi: If and only if there is a set of w+ 2 submitted pixel-shares including Vs and
this set of pixel-shares has the property, a same checking polynomial n(x) can be made
by each wm + 1 combined shares.

The w + 2 submitted pixel-shares are Vs Vs bey Vis Vt4+1s ++ Vig4o Where Pj, Po,..., Py are t
cheaters and P| is a critical cheater who knows Vo; V3; bess Vp. ni(x) and the value are

made by Vs Vo; vey Vis Vitis os Vor, then Vy42 = (Mw+2,dw+2) has to satisfy
Mo+2 + Vido+2 = m(@ + 2). (4)

It is noticed that the ¢ cheaters can get no information about 71,7|(%) and v4.2 =
(Mo+2»4q+2), and the probability of (4) is i In other words, the successful cheating
probability of P, is o End proof. O

4 Results and discussion

In this part, we show the experimental results and give a comparison between our scheme
and other cheating detectable SIS. In this example, let the threshold is (k, 2) = (6,1), and
the secret image O is divided into / blocks where each block includes k + S| = 8
secret pixels. Assuming one block B consists of the following 8 pixels: (do,...,45, bo, b1) =
(57, 68, 90, 231, 42, 89, 124, 186), the dealer selects an integer y = 10, then generates two
k—1=5 degree polynomials: w(x) = 57+ 68x+ 90x + 231x° + 42x" + 89x° and v(x) =
124 + 186x + 242x? + 2x3 + 46x* + 217x°, where aj + y- b; = 0,i = 2,3, 4, 5. Supposing
Zheng et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:42 Page 8 of 10

P|, Po,...,P6 participate in image reconstruction, the pixel-shares are v) = (75,64),v2 =
(148, 124), v3 = (209, 135), v4 = (220, 151), vs = (59, 134), v6 = (160, 141).

If all these 6 participants are honest, they submit real pixel-shares in image recon-
struction, and two polynomials w(x) = 57 + 68x + 90x? + 231x3 + 42x* + 89x° and
g(x) = 124 + 186x + 242x? + 2x? + 46x* + 217%? can be reconstructed, respec-
tively. They can also find y = 10, such that n(x) = ww) + y-g(@) = 424 171~ is
of degree |S? — 1. It means that there is no cheating behavior, and the pixel-block
B = (57, 68, 90, 231, 42, 89, 124, 186) is reconstructed.

k—2

Now we assume P}, P2 are two cheaters (« =2< |S?) who submit fake pixel-shares

vy = (98,109), V5 = (215,81) in image reconstruction. The cheating behavior can be
easily detected using our scheme. During cheating identification algorithm, all the 4
subsets which contain 3 honest participants can compute the same checking polyno-
mial n(x) = 42 + 171%. For example, (P3,P4, Ps) can get two interpolated polynomials
w*(«) = 148 + 1llx + 165x?, p*(x) = 140 + 6x + 109x?. Then, they can figure out a
unique integer y = 10 such that n(x) = w*(*) + y- y* («) = 42+171«. For another subset
of 3 honest participants (P3, P4, Pe), they can reconstruct two interpolated polynomials
W*(«) = 12 + 23x + 70x, y* (x) = 3 + 65x + 244%? from their pixel-shares. Then, they
can also figure out the integer r = 10 such that n(x) = W*(*) + y-g*(«*) = 424+171x%. On
the other side, each subset of three participants which contain P; or Py) deduces different
checking polynomials. Therefore, n(x) = w*(x)+y-9*(«) = 42+4+171~ is regarded as the
majority polynomial, and the cheaters can be identified successfully accordingly.

In [21], Yang et al. proposed an authentication approach in secret image sharing which
is also capable of identifying cheaters during secret reconstruction phase. The scheme
in [21] is also based on Thien-Lin’s scheme [3], but uses symmetric bivariate polynomial

to generate shadows. It encrypts each Kary) 1)

secret pixels into k pixel-shares, and the
size of the shadow is eI times of the secret image. The shadow size in our scheme is
teat which is smaller than the size in Yang et al’s scheme when w = |? > 1. In
cheating identification, not only the k participants, but also the other ” — k participants
work together to vote for the k participants using the property of symmetry bivariate
polynomial. The participants who get less than || votes are identified as cheaters.
However, in most cheating identifiable secret sharing schemes, the cheating identification
is carried out only by the participants in secret reconstruction, and it is not practical to
involve other n — k participants in cheating identification. In fact, if k participants work
together to identify cheaters in Yang et al’s scheme, the cheaters cannot be identified
since the cheater can always get more votes than honest participants. The comparison
between Yang et al’s scheme and the proposed scheme is shown in the following Table 1.

The symbol CI in Table 1 means the capability of cheating identification.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we consider the well-known cheating problem in polynomial-based (k, 1)
SIS, such that a group of malicious participants submit fake shadows during image recon-
struction. In order to prevent such cheating behavior, we construct a (k,1) SIS scheme
with cheating identification under the model of cheating identifiable SS scheme. Our
scheme is capable of identifying |S? | cheaters when k participants involve in image
reconstruction. In addition, the proposed scheme is based on the landmark Thien-Lin’s
polynomial-based SIS scheme, which can be easily extended into other polynomial-based
SIS schemes. Both the size of shadow and the capability of cheating identification are
