Abstract

Substrate deformation affects the behaviour of many cell types, including bone, skeletal muscle
and endothelial cells. Nowadays, in vitro tests are widely employed to study the
mechanotransduction induced by substrate deformation. The aim of in vitro systems is to
properly reproduce the mechanical stimuli sensed by the tissue in the cellular
microenvironment. Accurate strain measurement and control is therefore necessary to ensure the
cell senses the proper strain for the entire treatment. Different types of in vitro systems are
commercially available or can be custom-designed; however, none of these devices performs a
real-time measurement of the induced strains. In this study, we proposed a uniaxial strain device
for in vitro cell stimulation with an innovative real-time strain control. The system was designed
to induce sinusoidal waveform stimulation in a huge range of amplitude and frequency, to three
silicone chambers stretched by a linear actuator. The real-time strain measurement and control
algorithm is based on an optical tracking method implemented in LabVIEW 2015, and it is able
to adapt the input amplitude to the linear motor, if necessary, hanging the stimulation signal for
about 120 ms. Validation of the strain values measured during the real-time tracking algorithm
was carried out through a comparison with the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. We
investigated the influence of number of reference points and image size on the algorithm
accuracy. Experimental results showed that the tracking algorithm allowed for a real-time
measurement of membrane longitudinal strains with a relative error of 0.3%, on average, in
comparison to the strains measured with DIC in post-processing analysis. We showed a high
homogeneity of the strain pattern on the entire chamber base for different stimulation
conditions. Finally, as proof of concept, we employed the uniaxial strain device to induce
substrate deformation in a human osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS-2). The experimental results
showed a consistent change in cell shape in response to the mechanical strain.

1. Introduction

Mechanical stimulations play a critical role in the homeo-
stasis and development of a variety of cells and tissues. Several
studies have demonstrated how mechanical forces affect bone
resorption and formation [1, 2], organ morphogenesis [3],
skeletal muscle differentiation and organisation [4], as well
as the development of the central nervous system [5]. Cells
are capable of sensing mechanical stimuli and converting them
into biological responses through a process known as mechan-
otransduction [6—8]. The capability to convert mechanical sig-
nals into biochemical responses allows the cell rapid adapta-
tion to physical changes occurring in the environment [9, 10].
Because of the in vivo environment complexity, in terms of
biological and mechanical factors, several studies have relied
on the use of in vitro systems to investigate cell response to
mechanical stimulations [11, 12]. The aim of these systems is
to recreate the conditions required to engender mechanotrans-
duction in a more controlled cell culture system. However, it
has to be remarked that tissue-level strains must be amplified
at cellular level to properly reproduce the in vivo mechano-
transduction signalling [13, 14].

One of the most common mechanical stimuli which cells
are subjected to is substrate strain, and it is determined by
physical events depending on the different cell microenviron-
ment. For instance, pulsatile blood pressure, originating from
the heart and driving blood circulation throughout the cardi-
ovascular system, induces circumferential stretch on the ves-
sel wall, producing an internal deformation on the vascular
endothelial cells [15]. Furthermore, gravity and compressive
force generated by muscle contraction during locomotion or
training result in small deformation of the bone extracellu-
lar matrix [16]. In addition, skeletal and cardiac muscles are
exposed to mechanical strain, and their ability to properly
respond to mechanical loads is critical in the development and
maintenance of the tissues [17]. In view of this, in vitro cell
strain devices are fundamental for a better understanding of
cell mechanotransduction [18—20]. These devices are based
on the stretching of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chambers,
in which the cells to be tested are seeded. To guarantee that
the strains induced on the chamber bottom are properly trans-
mitted to the cells, the PDMS is usually functionalised (e.g.
by treating it with collagen) accordingly to the cell type to
be tested. Substrate functionalisation, in fact, allows binding
extracellular matrix proteins, providing a favourable terrain for
cell adhesion, thus preventing cell decoupling from the sub-
strate during cell stretching [21].

Currently, a few cell-stretching devices are commercially
available, such as Flexcell (Flexcell International Corporation,
Hillsborough, NC, USA), Strex cell (Strex Inc.) and Electro-
Force (Bose Corporation) systems, and several studies have
been carried out with the mechanical characterisation of the
strain profile. The membrane strain field [22, 23] and mem-
brane strain homogeneity [24] have been studied for the Flex-
cell apparatus, while the inhomogeneous strain distribution
has been measured for the Strex cell device [25]. However,
these devices have several constraints that limit their diffu-
sion in research. They are costly to purchase and maintain

L Apa et al

and have limited functional capabilities, since they are built to
work in a specific range of stimulation parameters (waveform,
frequency and amplitude). To overcome these issues, various
types of custom-made stretch systems have been recently pro-
posed. Clark et al [26] developed a strain device based on a
linear stepper motor and validated it by applying cyclic uni-
axial strains to skeletal muscle myoblasts cultured on a silic-
one sheet substrate. Similarly, Atcha et al [27] devised a low-
cost stretching system consisting of a programmable servo-
motor, and used it to induce cyclic uniaxial strain on macro-
phages and cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, Richardson
et al [28] fabricated a device capable of subjecting cells to
biaxial stretch via radial deformation of circular elastomeric
membranes. Finally, the study of Seriani et al [29] showed
the development of a strain system based on a variable-stroke
cam—lever—tappet mechanism that induces uniaxial strain on
PDMS membranes.

It has to be remarked that in all the above-reported devices
the local strain values are not monitored during the test.
Instead, the measurement and control of induced strain is cru-
cial to ensure that the cells are subjected to the proper mech-
anical stimulus for the entire treatment duration. At present,
real-time strain measurements are based on the use of electric
resistance gauges, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, electromag-
netic or acoustic sensors [29-32], and are mainly employed
for monitoring structural conditions to guarantee operational
safety. Nevertheless, most of them are considered as embed-
ded sensors or attached sensors, and their use introduces some
limitations, such as the modification of the mechanical prop-
erties of a specimen, leading to systematic errors. To date, to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, no stretching devices allow
for real-time monitoring of substrate deformation during cell
testing.

Within this context, in this study we propose a custom-
made uniaxial strain device for in vitro cell stimulation based
on an innovative real-time strain measurement and control sys-
tem. The real-time algorithm was implemented in LabVIEW
2015 and consists of an optical tracking method for local strain
measurement and a closed loop for input amplitude optimisa-
tion. A validation of the strain values measured during the real-
time tracking algorithm was carried out through a comparison
with the digital image correlation (DIC) method. Indeed, even
if DIC has also been proposed in the literature for real-time
strain measurements [31-34], the use of a tool developed in
LabVIEW allowed us to synchronise the real-time strain meas-
urement with the linear actuator motion, to obtain control of
the induced strain. Moreover, most DIC applications to real-
time strain measurements concern the development of optical
extensometers, and have been tested to capture small strains, or
strains in quasi-static applications. On the contrary, our applic-
ation required the measurement of quite large (up to 7%) and
dynamic strains. In addition, the use of DIC for real-time strain
measurements was based on complex systems, which cannot
be employed in our particular application, where the use of live
cells is involved and a control strategy is necessary to continu-
ously change the strains induced by the silicone substrate.

After the strain device characterisation was carried out,
we proceeded with a proof of concept of cell stretching. The
Meas. Sci. Technol. 31 (2020) 125702

proposed device was used to mechanically stretch a human
osteoblast-like cell line, and the cell morphology was studied
to assess changes in the shape as a consequence of the stretch-
ing treatment.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Development of the uniaxial strain system

The stretching device was designed to induce sinusoidal
deformations in the range of 0.5%—7% and 0.5 Hz—2 Hz, so to
test a huge variety of cells, including bone, skeletal muscle and
endothelial cells [15, 26, 35, 36]. In addition, the device was
designed to have compact size and mass to be easily moved
and placed under a microscope, for real-time strain control, or
inside an incubator for long treatments. All the materials were
chosen accordingly: plexiglass and aluminium guaranteed low
mass and the possibility to be sterilised by ultraviolet light.

The device is composed of a linear actuator (Zaber,
NA11B16-T4), a stepper motor controller (Zaber, X-MCB2),
two linear slide rails, two plexiglass supports, one fixed and
one connected to the linear actuator, and an aluminium base.
The experimental system is completed by a stereomicro-
scope (Nikon, SMZ800 N) incorporated with a high-frequency
camera (Basler, acA2040-180 Km) and a personal computer
equipped with a NI PCIe1433 frame grabber (National Instru-
ments, Austin, TX, USA), as shown in figure I(a). The device
allows stretching three silicone culture chambers (STB-CH-
04; Strex) simultaneously (figure 1(b)). The chambers are
commercially available and are composed of a silicone elast-
omer PDMS that creates a special flexible thin membrane
(100-200 um). Software was developed in LabVIEW 2015 to
set all the control parameters; namely the amplitude, frequency
and duration of the displacement signal. The entire structure
was allocated below the stereomicroscope to measure the local
deformation induced on the silicone chambers through optical
image correlation methods. The optical distortion induced by
the lens of the SMZ800 N stereomicroscope has been previ-
ously evaluated [37], and was found to be 0.3% on average for
horizontal and vertical directions at 1X and 4X magnification.
Notably, the thin membrane thickness did not interfere with
optical measurements.

In order to allow the strain measurements, a random speckle
pattern was preliminarily made on the silicone chamber sur-
face by using black paint spray. The main properties that
describe the speckle pattern were evaluated, obtaining a value
of coverage factor, the ratio of the grey pixels over the entire
number of pixels, of about 60%, and an average particle dia-
meter size of 2 + 2 pixels.

2.2. Real-time strain measurement and control system

The real-time strain measurement and control system was
implemented in LabVIEW 2015, using the up-to-date ver-
sion of a Motion Estimation virtual instrument (VI), “‘IMAQ
Optical Flow’, to capture the silicone base deformation. This
VI is based on the evaluation of the motion observed in a
sequence of images. In particular, it computes the change in

location of a set of reference points (pixels) between two con-
secutive image frames using the pyramid-based Lucas and
Kanade algorithm. Briefly, this algorithm assumes that the
flow is basically constant in a local neighbourhood of the pixel
under consideration, and it uses the least squares criterion to
solve the basic optical flow equations for all the pixels in that
neighbourhood [38]. The control system was developed with
the aim of obtaining a fast but accurate measurement of the
longitudinal strain occurring on the silicone chamber during
the entire test, in order to adapt the amplitude of the linear
actuator accordingly in a closed-loop circuit. A schematic of
the control system is shown in figure 2.

The input parameters to the control software are the linear
actuator peak-to-peak displacement (As), the chamber desired
longitudinal strain (€g.;) and the relative error (€77 re acc) that
can be accepted. During the test, images of the stretched
chamber are acquired and processed by the optical tracking
Meas. Sci. Technol. 31 (2020) 125702

algorithm. The algorithm tracks the position of the points
selected by the user all through the acquired images, meas-
uring the actual locations. The percentage deformation value
between the two points at any time is calculated as follows:

—~6,1)—-L
meas = (0p2 = 9p1) ~ Lo - 100 (1)
Lo

where 5p; and 5y2 are the locations, in the stretching direc-
tion, of the first and second points, respectively, and Lo is their
initial distance (namely 350 pixels). The relative error (er7;¢1)
between the desired and measured deformations is calculated
as follows:

E —e_E
CIT ro) = “des <meas (2)

Edes

If the absolute value of the relative error is higher than the
value of the accepted relative error (e7T;ej_ acc), the algorithm
modifies the peak-to-peak input amplitude to the linear actu-
ator as follows:

Asp41 = ASn (14+ Q: errye1) (3)

where n is the iteration number, a is a multiplicative factor
imposed equal to 0.2 in accordance with preliminary exper-
iments and (1 + @ -: err,,;) 1s higher or lower than | if the
measured deformation is lower or higher than the desired one,
respectively. An accepted relative error of 5% has been fixed
for the closed-loop control system.

On the basis of this recursive control algorithm, the whole
real-time system operation is made up of two different parts.
In the first part, seeking, the software aims at capturing the
optimal peak-to-peak amplitude entering the linear actuator to
obtain the desired strain value on the silicone chamber, while
in the second part, monitoring, the algorithm performs a real-
time monitoring of the strain induced on the membrane only
from time to time, according to the operator’s needs. In detail,
in the first part, the tracking algorithm measures the strains
occurring in the chamber during each signal period and com-
pares the measured error with the accepted error without inter-
rupting the control signal. If the relative error is higher than the
accepted value, the algorithm stops the movement of the lin-
ear actuator at the end of the following period, modifies the
input amplitude and immediately starts the stimulation again.
As a result of this, in the seeking part it is plausible that the
movement is interrupted every two cycles. The first part ends
when the measured strain is lower than the desired one. At this
point, the treatment begins according to the duration imposed
through the software. During this second part, the local lon-
gitudinal strain is measured more rarely, only to double-check
the relative error. It has to be noted that some treatments might
last up to 24 h; the measurement of local strains could there-
fore be done more rarely to avoid system memory overflow,
also according to the cell type. If necessary, the amplitude A\s
supplied to the linear actuator is modified by using the same
logic employed in the seeking part.

from each other; scale: 5:1. (c) Stretch chamber with the ROI

(1050 x 1050 pixels - 11 x 11 nodes) used for DIC.

The optical tracking algorithm correlation speed was eval-
uated by computing the time needed for one single match-
ing between two consecutive images and, in parallel, we pro-
ceeded with a measurement of the effectiveness of the optical
tracking method in relation to the image size and the number
of reference points. Indeed, the final aim was to find an optimal
compromise between the measurement accuracy and the pro-
cessing time. The tracking algorithm was in fact employed to
have a fast measurement of the longitudinal strain to be used
for real-time control, and its accuracy was verified through a
comparison with DIC measurements in a post-processing ana-
lysis. As for the correlation speed measurement, six image
sizes (2040 x 2040 pixels, 2040 x 1020 pixels, 1020 x 1020
pixels, 1020 x 510 pixels, 510 x 510 pixels and 510 x 50
pixels) were evaluated and, for each of them, the algorithm was
tested to track a different number of points, namely 2, 4, 6, 8
and 10. The tests were then repeated 15 times for the 30 com-
binations of image size and pairs of points, which were kept
fixed for each image size. As for the accuracy measurements,
we performed a series of tests stretching three silicone cham-
bers with a | Hz sinusoidal signal for eight peak-to-peak strain
amplitude values, namely 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6% and
7%. The images were acquired with a frequency of 100 fps and
an optical magnification of 0.5 x. As representative of the limit
conditions, we considered the largest and the smallest image
size (2040 x 2040 pixels and 510 x 50 pixels), and for each
of them we measured the strain occurring between two single
points and five pairs of points. For both image sizes, the two
single points were placed along the longitudinal axis symmet-
rically with respect to the central vertical axis and 350 pixels
apart (see figure 3(b)). When needed, the other four pairs of
points (always 350 pixels apart from each other) were equally
distributed along the vertical axis of the chamber with respect
to the vertical dimension of the image.

The capability of the seeking part of the real-time strain sys-
tem to reach the optimal peak-to-peak amplitude was evalu-
ated by aseries of tests performed starting from different initial
displacements of the linear actuator. The desired strain (€4;)
was set to 1% for a 1 Hz stretching signal and the accepted
relative error (€77;¢)_ acc) WaS imposed at 5%. The optimal amp-
litude corresponding to the desired strain was estimated to be
about 0.2 mm with some preliminary experiments. Eight dif-
ferent values of the initial linear actuator displacement were
tested, namely 0.1 mm, 0.125 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.175 mm,
0.225 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.275 mm and 0.3 mm, and for each
of them the searching procedure was repeated five times. Of
note, four values matched with an initial strain lower than the
desired one, and four with an initial strain greater, and the tests
were performed in a pseudo random order. For each test we
analysed the number of iterations needed by the seeking part to
reach the optimal amplitude with a relative error (e77r,,.;) lower
than the accepted one.

2.3. Validation of the tracking method and characterisation of
the membrane strain field

After having demonstrated that the shortest correlation time
of the tracking algorithm occurred for two single points and
an image size of 510 x 50 pixels, and that no difference in the
accuracy of the optical tracking method arises for the number
of points to be correlated and the image size, as shown below
in the Results section, we proceeded to evaluate whether the
strains measured in these strict conditions were representat-
ive of the strains developed in the entire silicone membrane.
The strains measured with the tracking algorithm were there-
fore compared with the measurements obtained through the
use of a global DIC algorithm previously proposed by our
department [39]. The correlation algorithm is based on the
processing of digital image sequences, returning a full eval-
uation of the strains. Briefly, the processing procedure uses
a non-linear least-squares fitting performed globally, on the
whole image, and simultaneously across several images. The
first image is taken as the undeformed image reference and
it is divided into a fixed and regular grid of square elements.
In order to associate a square sub-image with each element
of the subsequent deformed image, the algorithm resamples
the deformed image on a distorted pixel grid: a bilinear shape
function and a bicubic interpolation scheme are used to locate
the new sampling points and to estimate the grey level of the
resampled pixels, respectively.

Of note, the strain values obtained with the tracking method
were first compared with the average values of the longitud-
inal strain obtained with DIC. Subsequently, an evaluation of
the longitudinal strain homogeneity was also performed. It has
to be remarked that to obtain an accurate measurement of the
longitudinal strain over the entire silicone membrane a huge
number of nodes must be correlated through DIC, making this
method applicable only in post-processing.

Figure 3(a) shows an example of the entire silicone stretch
chamber in which we highlighted the area employed to set the
two reference points (two single pixels) for real-time strain

measurement. This region has a size of 510 x 50 pixels and
is chosen in the centre of the silicone chamber; the two refer-
ence points were placed along the longitudinal axis (stretch-
ing direction), symmetrically with respect to the central ver-
tical axis and 350 pixels apart along the stretching direction.
A series of preliminary experiments were aimed at determin-
ing the possible sources of error and the response of the optical
algorithm in dynamic conditions. First, since the pixel place-
ment is related to the determination of the chamber’s edges
from the operator, we evaluated how a change in the location
of the reference points of + 10 pixels for both the longitud-
inal and axial directions affected the measured strains. The
results showed that the relative error calculated between the
strains measured for the two central points and those meas-
ured in the other tested conditions was always lower than
2%. Subsequently, to evaluate the error induced by the optical
algorithm when tracking the reference points for a long cyclic
treatment, we tracked four points placed on the tip of the lin-
ear actuator, which was asked to reproduce a sinusoidal move-
ment for 15 min, under two different conditions (0.5% and 7%
at | Hz). The results showed that the tracking algorithm repro-
duced the imposed movement with an average relative error of
5.5% and 3.7% for the smaller and the bigger displacement,
respectively. Moreover, the coefficient of variation computed
over the entire test was found to be always lower than 1% and
0.2% for the two conditions, respectively. Of note, we did not
correct the average relative error (as in [40]) since the aim of
this work was focused on the strains occurring on the base
chamber. The error correction has been therefore directly per-
formed with reference to this variable (with comparison to the
DIC results).

Figure 3(c) shows the region of interest (ROI, red grid
in figure) employed for DIC, which has a total size of
1050 x 1050 pixels and is divided into 10 x 10 subsets. The
DIC algorithm computes the strain occurring for each of the
121 nodes. Of note, a ROI of 1050 x 1050 pixels basically
covers the entire silicone chamber excluding the parts where
the side effects are expected to be more relevant.

Validation tests were carried out stretching three silicone
chambers with a 1 Hz sinusoidal signal for eight different
values of peak-to-peak strain amplitude, in the range mainly
employed for in vitro testing: 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%
and 7%. Each test was 10s long. The camera frame rate was set
at 100 fps and, in order to focus the entire base of the stretch
chamber with the maximum image resolution (2040 x 2040
pixels), we employed an optical magnification of 0.5 x accord-
ingly to the pixel size of the camera (5.5 um x 5.5 um). After
that, we performed a linear regression between the imposed
strains and the strains measured through the tracking method
and between the imposed strains and the strains resulting from
DIC. To take into account the noise induced by the two optical
methods we added the strain values measured at 0% strain
to the measurements performed at the strain values reported
above. In order to compare the strain values obtained with the
tracking method and the average strain over the entire mem-
brane obtained by DIC, the percentage relative error was cal-
culated as follows:

where J; and jupyc are the strains estimated by linear regres-
sion for the optical tracking algorithm and for the DIC method,
respectively.

Finally, the strain distribution was quantified in the whole
ROI of the stretch chambers, 1050 x 1050 pixels divided into
11 x 11 nodes, to evaluate membrane homogeneity. The mean
value and the standard deviation among all the selected nodes
were analysed. Homogeneity tests were carried out stretch-
ing the chamber with a 2 s sinusoidal signal at three different
frequencies (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz and 2 Hz) and two imposed strain
values (0.5% and 7%), almost representing the minimum and
maximum deformation values in the range of use of the in
vitro strain device. Of note, to ensure tensile conditions for
the entire treatment, the stretching signal included a constant
stretch equal to 10% of the amplitude. The resulting signal was
therefore composed of a constant load of 0.05% plus a periodic
signal of 0.5%, and of a constant load of 0.7% plus a peri-
odic signal of 7% for the two tested conditions. Of note, for
a comprehensive analysis of the substrate strain homogeneity
we employed a ROI representative of the entire chamber. Nev-
ertheless, we performed a series of preliminary experiments to
evaluate the influence of the ROI size and number of nodes on
the homogeneity results. In a first test, the distance among the
nodes was kept constant and three ROI dimensions were con-
sidered: 1050 x 1050 pixels divided into 11 x 11 nodes, and
two sub-parts of 630 x 630 pixels and 315 x 315 pixels with
the residual number of nodes, namely 7 x 7 nodes and 3 x 3
nodes, respectively. In a second test, we kept fixed the ROI
size, 1050 x 1050 pixels, and measured the strain occurring
in the stretch chamber for three different numbers of nodes:
11 x 11,7 x 7 and 3 ~x 3. Also for these tests the chamber was
stretched with a sinusoidal signal at 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz and 2 Hz for
two imposed strain values (0.5% and 7%).

2.4. Cell culture

Human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 (catalog no.
HTLO1001), an osteoblast-like cell line [41], was purchased
from Banca Biologica and Cell Factory (IRCCS Azienda
Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-IST, Genova, Italy).
SaOS-2 was grown in Petri dishes with Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Euroclone) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/ml penicillin/strepto-
mycin (Euroclone) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO) for 5 d.
Before cells were seeded on the surface, the stretch chamber
was sterilised by autoclave and then coated with a nano-film of
collagen-I, the most abundant protein in the bone matrix. One
millilitre of collagen-I at 10 ug/ml was added and incubated at
37 °C in 5% CO; for 4 h [21, 42] to favour bone cell adhesion
on silicone substrate. At the end of the coating procedure, the
excess liquid was removed and the chamber was allowed to
dry overnight. Following sterilisation by ultraviolet exposure,
cells were seeded at 50 000 cells cm~? in the chamber and left
to spread for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CQp.

2.5. Experimental test and cellular analysis

To prove that the cells seeded in the silicone chambers were
capable of responding to the strains induced through the use
of the proposed device, we proceeded with two prelimin-
ary experiments. First, the cells were slowly (f = 0.05 Hz)
stretched from the initial condition (0.1% pre-stretch as
described above) to the final condition of 1% stretch. During
this test we focused on a few single cells to evaluate their mor-
phological changes at the end of the stretch.

Subsequently, we proceeded with the simulation of a real
treatment by subjecting the cells to a deformation of 1% of the
silicone chamber, starting from a pre-stretched condition of
0.1%, for 15 min at 1 Hz. All these stretching parameters were
chosen as representative of in vivo substrate strain in osteo-
blastic cells [36]. The aim of this test was to evaluate the aver-
age changes occurring in the cells’ shape during real treatment.
Notably, since a functionalisation treatment with collagen-I
was performed to favour bone cell adhesion on the silicone
substrate as described above, we proceeded with a series of
preliminary experiments to confirm that the strains measured
on the silicone base, 1.e. the values employed to deeply char-
acterise the entire system, were in agreement with the values
measured on the collagen nano-film. In detail, a speckle pat-
tern was printed below the silicone chamber base and on the
collagen-I layer. The chamber was stretched with a | Hz sinus-
oidal input at 1% for 5 s by tracking the speckle on the cham-
ber base, and the average longitudinal strain field measured on
the chamber base and on the collagen-I layer were compared.
The results showed an agreement between the two average
strains higher than 99%. The homogeneity of the strain field on
the collagen film was also in complete agreement with that of
the silicone chamber base, thus confirming that the collagen-I
nano-layer does not alter the strain transmission from the sil-
icon chamber to the cells.

For cell analysis, phase contrast images were acquired with
an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TS 100) and a digital
camera (Nikon, DS-Fi2). During the first test we compared
the cells’ shape in the stretched condition with that in the pre-
stretched one, with reference to the very same cells (n = 5);
in the second test we compared the average shape of the cell
culture (n = 36) at the end of the treatment with the initial one.
The cell shape was computed with ImageJ software; the out-
line of each cell was depicted by the user (as shown in figure
4(a)), and the best-fitting ellipse was then obtained by the soft-
ware, as shown in figure 4(b). Cell roundness was computed
as the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis, thus expressing
the degree to which the cell shape differs from that of a circle.
Of note, even if a cell’s shape is usually different from that
of a pure ellipse, this procedure is commonly used in experi-
mental biology to evaluate cell response to mechanical stimuli
[27, 43, 44].

than the optimal one.

The linear relationship between the strain imposed and the
strain measured with the tracking algorithm and with DIC was
assessed by linear regression with the p-value fixed at 0.05.

The Mann—Whitney test was used to look for significant

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Real-time strain measurement system

Figure 5(a) shows the computation time needed by the tracking
algorithm to measure the strains between two single images as
a function of image size and number of reference points. As
expected, two-way ANOVA showed a reduction in computa-
tion time for decreasing size (p < 0.0001) and number of refer-
ence points (p < 0.0001). In particular, a post hoc test showed
that regardless of the number of reference points, a significant
decrease in the computation time occurred when working with
the smallest image size tested (510 x 50 pixels) compared with
all the others. Figure 5(b) shows the computation time meas-
ured for the optimal image size of 510 x 50 pixels for all the
reference points. The results showed a significant decrease in
the computational time for 6, 8 and 10 points compared to 2
points. Furthermore, even if not statically significant, a lower
average computation time (0.27 ms + 0.04 ms) was measured

when considering two single points than when using four ref-
erence points (0.31 ms + 0.06 ms).

Figure 6 shows the strain values measured by the optical
tracking algorithm for the different numbers of reference
points and image sizes tested, for the eight values of selected
strain. The linear regression tests showed values of R? higher
than 0.99 for all four tracking conditions (image size and
number of reference points). As expected, two-way ANOVA
revealed a significant difference for the imposed strain factor.
On the other hand, no significant difference (p = 0.90) was
shown for the tracking conditions factor, which includes
changes in both image size and number of reference points.
Tukey’s multiple comparison test also showed no signific-
ant difference between each combination of tested conditions
(image size and number of reference points) for all the strain
values imposed.

Taken all together, these results allowed us to choose the
optimal working condition for the tracking algorithm in terms
of low computational time, without affecting the accuracy
of the measurements: two single points for an image size of
510 x 50 pixels. It is important to underline that, since the
computational times were calculated for one single matching,
the whole time for each iteration of the tracking algorithm
depends on the frame rate of the camera, which, in turn,
depends on the stimulation signal frequency.

Table | shows the number of iterations needed to reach the
desired strain during the seeking part, as well as the final relat-
ive error, when the convergence of the algorithm was tested by
starting from eight different conditions. As expected, one-way
ANOVA analysis revealed a significant difference (p < 0.0001)

in the number of iterations needed to reach the desired strain
when the initial amplitude was both lower and higher than the
optimal one. As for the relative error obtained at the end of the
seeking part of the algorithm, statistical analysis did not show
any significant difference either for initial amplitudes lower
than the optimal one or for initial amplitudes greater than the
optimal one.

Figure 7 shows an example of one searching test of the
real-time tracking algorithm in which the starting value of
the linear actuator displacement was equal to 0.3 mm. The
desired strain (Eqs) was set to 1% for a 1 Hz stretching

signal. Figure 7(a) shows the displacement of the linear actu-
ator during the seeking part. It is possible to note that, after
two periods of stretching, the algorithm interrupted for about
120 ms. This is the time needed by the algorithm to create the
image memory allocations for the new images to be acquired
and to set up the new control parameters. Figure 7(b) shows the
relative percentage error between the desired and the measured
deformation for each algorithm iteration. After nine iterations
the relative error became lower than 5%, the accepted relative
error value imposed in advance. Subsequently, the algorithm
entered the monitoring part, as described in the ‘Real-time
strain measurement and control system’ section. Of note, the
test shown in figure 7 was performed starting from a peak-
to-peak displacement quite far from the optimal one on pur-
pose. Nonetheless, the algorithm needed 19 s to set the optimal
input amplitude, a value that can be considered negligible with
respect to the treatment duration, always higher than 15 min
and up to 24 h in several cases.

3.2. Characterisation of the membrane strain

The linear regression tests performed for the results obtained
through the tracking algorithm in the optimal conditions pre-
viously obtained (two points and an image size of 510 x 50
pixels), and for the DIC employed to correlate images of
1050 x 1050 pixels, showed values of R? always higher than
0.99 in the strain values measured by the DIC method as
well as in the optical tracking algorithm. This result con-
firmed a linear relationship between the strain imposed and
the strain measured by DIC as well as the strain imposed and
the strain measured by the tracking algorithm. According to

these results, the percentage relative error (see equation (4))
was calculated in order to validate the strains measured with
the optical tracking method with reference to the average strain
of the entire chamber, measured by the DIC technique. The
results showed that the tracking algorithm always overestim-
ated the strains measured with DIC, with a relative error almost
constant for all the imposed strains (5.6% on average), as dis-
played in figure 8. After correcting this systematic error, the
strain values obtained with the tracking method showed a rel-
ative error lower than 0.3% compared to the strain measured
over the whole silicone chamber with DIC.

Figure 9 shows the mean and SD of the strains measured
for all the nodes selected on the larger dimension of the tested
ROIs, representative of the whole chamber, 1050 x 1050

 

pixels divided into 11 x 11 nodes. The experimental results
pointed out a strain pattern highly homogeneous in the entire
ROI in all the tested conditions.

Table 2 displays the mean value and SD of the strains meas-
ured between the nodes for two specific conditions: at the first
peak and the first trough of the stimulation signals. As expec-
ted, for all the tests, the difference between the signal amp-
litude, namely the peak value minus the trough value, and the
theoretic input strain (0.5% or 7%) was smaller than the relat-
ive error (5%) imposed.

Interestingly, the results obtained by varying the ROI size
and the number of nodes revealed a small trend toward lower
strain values when increasing the ROI size, while no differ-
ences were noted when increasing the number of nodes (data
not shown). As expected, by increasing the number of nodes
the SD increased as well; as a matter of fact, the use of a low
number of nodes did not allow us to perform a comprehensive
evaluation of the strain homogeneity over the entire surface. It
is worth noting that the SDs obtained for the entire ROI and
shown in figure 9 and table | are quite low, and contain the
variations of the nodes over the entire ROI, thus including also
any sub-ROI in the chamber.

3.3. Cellular analysis

Figure 10(a) shows the roundness of the five cells focused
at the beginning and at the end of the 1% stretch. The res-
ults showed that all of them encountered a decrease (or no
change) in the roundness value, expressing a lengthening of
their shape when maintained in the 1% stretched condition.
Figure 10(b) shows the average roundness of the cultured cells
after 15 min of 1%, 1 Hz treatment. The results showed that
Meas. Sci. Technol. 31 (2020) 125702

the cultured cells showed, on average, a significant (p < 0.05)
reduction of 18% of their roundness value. In particular, the
major axis encountered a trend toward larger values after the
treatment, and the minor axis a significant reduction of 16%
on average (p < 0.05; data not shown). All these data con-
firmed that the cells seeded on the silicone chambers stretched
by our device are capable of sensing the substrate deforma-
tion, and, as a result of this, encountered a change in their
morphology.

4. Conclusions

In this paper, we developed an in vitro device for measur-
ing uniaxial strain substrate deformation with an innovative
real-time strain measurement and control system. To accur-
ately approach the study of mechanotransduction following
cell substrate deformation in vitro, real-time measurement of
the induced strain is crucial to ensure the proper mechanical
stimulus acting on the cells. The uniaxial strain device pro-
posed in this study allows stretching three silicone chambers
simultaneously in the range of 0.5%-7% and 0.5 Hz—2 Hz, to
test a huge variety of cells; for example, bone, skeletal muscle
and endothelial cells. The real-time strain measurement and
control was developed in LabVIEW 2015 by using an optical
tracking algorithm. The use of a tool developed in LabVIEW
allowed us to synchronise the various components of the entire
setup (i.e. the image acquisition, the motion of the linear actu-
ator and the real-time strain system) and to integrate the con-
trol strategy to continuously change the strain induced on the
silicone substrate. The effectiveness of the optimal tracking
algorithm was evaluated by computing the correlation speed
between two consecutive images and by analysing the meas-
urement accuracy given different conditions (image size and
number of reference points). The optimal correlation time
was found to be 0.27 ms + 0.04 ms for a size of 510 x 50
pixels with two single reference points. The algorithm was
also demonstrated to converge to the desired value for ini-
tial amplitudes lower and higher than the optimal one. To
validate the real-time strain measurements, the strains meas-
ured with the real-time tracking algorithm were compared with
those obtained from DIC, allowing compensation of the sys-
tematic error. After systematic error correction, the strain val-
ues measured with the tracking algorithm showed a relative
error lower than 0.3% compared with DIC values. The use
of DIC also allowed evaluation of the strain homogeneity of
the entire substrate. Finally, we performed a series of tests
to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed device on cell cul-
tures. Our results showed that SaOS-2 human osteosarcoma
cells significantly changed their shape in response to substrate
deformation.
