noo oF omer Background: Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) can exert functions via forming
Nanyang Technological triplex with DNA. The current methods in predicting the triplex formation mainly rely
University, Singapore 639798, on mathematic statistic according to the base paring rules. However, these methods
Singapore have two main limitations: (1) they identify a large number of triplex-forming IncRNAs,

is available at the end of the but the limited number of experimentally verified triplex-forming IncRNA indicates

article that maybe not all of them can form triplex in practice, and (2) their predictions only
consider the theoretical relationship while lacking the features from the experimentally
verified data.

Results: In this work, we develop an integrated program named TriplexFPP (Triplex
Forming Potential Prediction), which is the first machine learning model in DNA:RNA

triplex prediction. TriplexFPP predicts the most likely triplex-forming IncRNAs and

DNA sites based on the experimentally verified data, where the high-level features

are learned by the convolutional neural networks. In the fivefold cross validation, the
average values of Area Under the ROC curves and PRC curves for removed redundancy
triplex-forming IncRNA dataset with threshold 0.8 are 0.9649 and 0.9996, and these two
values for triplex DNA sites prediction are 0.8705 and 0.9671, respectively. Besides, we
also briefly summarize the cis and trans targeting of triplexes IncRNAs.

Conclusions: The TriplexFPP is able to predict the most likely triplex-forming IncRNAs
from all the IncRNAs with computationally defined triplex forming capacities and the
potential of a DNA site to become a triplex. It may provide insights to the exploration
of IncRNA functions.

Background

The advances in sequencing technologies enable the discovery of the vast amount of
Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs). IncRNAs can serve as signals, decoys, guides, and
scaffolds to carry out functions like chromatin states modulation and gene expression
regulation. They act via the interactions with DNA, protein, and other RNA, in the way
of coordinating regulatory proteins, localizing to target loci, shaping three-dimensional

(3D) nuclear organization [1-3], etc.

One way for IncRNA to interact with DNA is to form triplex structures [4]. Triplex
is a kind of direct RNA—DNA interaction mechanism, it is formed through the bind-
ing of RNA sites and purine rich strand of duplex DNA under the forward or reverse
Hoogsteen base-pairing rule. Some IncRNAs are proved to execute functions via form-
ing DNA:RNA triplexes, for example, promoter associated IncRNA interacts with TTF-I
to repress transcription of rRNA [5], FENDRR increases PRC2 occupancy at the triplex
formation sites [6], MEG3 forms DNA-IncRNA triplex with TGF-f gene to modulate the
gene activity [7], PARTICLE binds to MAT2A promoter CpG island as triplex to con-
tribute to gene-silencing machineries [8], KHPS1 interacts with SPHK1 to anchor the
IncRNA and associated effector proteins to the gene promoter [9], HOTAIR forms tri-
plex with PCDH7 and HOXB2 to regulate adipogenic differentiation [10], MIRIOOHG
acts via triplex formation to regulate p27 [11], and promoter and pre-rRNA antisense
guides associated CHD4/NuRD to the rDNA promoter [12].

Although the recent development of high throughput techniques, such as Chromatin
Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP-seq) [13], capture hybridization analysis of RNA
targets (CHART-seq) [14], RNA Antisense Purification (RAP-seq) [15], and chromatin
oligo affinity precipitation (ChOP-seq) [7], has helped to generate the genome-wide map
of IncRNA chromatin interactions for specific IncRNAs via deciphering their binding
sites, most of them are implemented in crosslinked chromatin which contain RNA asso-
ciated to DNA binding proteins. Therefore, they cannot provide reliable references for
the studying of DNA:RNA triplex formation. To reveal the existence of the DNA:RNA
triplex interactions in vivo, Cetin et al. [16] developed a method to map the genome-
wide DNA:RNA triplexes by excluding the chromatin crosslinking . This method proved
the physiological relevance of DNA:RNA triplex structures.

Currently, the prediction of DNA:RNA triplex mainly relies on the base paring rules-
related mathematic statistics. Triplexator is proposed to systematically identify the
potential triplex forming sites of RNA and the targeting sites on DNA by taking the
Hoogsteen and reverse-Hoogsteen base-pairing into account [17], Triplex-Inspector is
designed to select sequence-specific ligands and targets by considering the gene loca-
tion and genomic architecture [18], LongTarget is presented to detect motifs and bind-
ing sites in forming triplex by considering non-canonical rules [19], and Triplex Domain
Finder (TDF) is developed to predict triplexes and characterize IncRNA and the corre-
sponding DNA targets [20].

Although the above methods can identify potential triplexes according to the canoni-
cal rules, they predict a large population of IncRNAs with triplex forming potential.
However, the limited number of experimentally identified triplex-forming IncRNAs
indicates that maybe not all of them can form triplex in practice. Besides, the computa-
tional methods only calculate the theoretical triplex potential, while do not consider any
in vivo or in vitro assays verified data.

In this work, we have the following two aims: (1) predicting the most likely triplex-
forming IncRNAs in practice from the IncRNAs owning triplex forming capabilities
calculated by the computational methods, and (2) predicting the potential of DNA
sites in forming triplex based on the experimentally verified data. For these purposes,
we develop TriplexFPP (Triplex Forming Potential Prediction). It is the first machine
learning program in DNA:RNA triplex forming potential prediction according to our
Zhang et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:522 Page 3 of 13

knowledge. In triplex IncRNA prediction, the average values of Area Under the ROC
(AUROC) and Area Under the PRC (AUPRC) for fivefold cross validation on removed
redundancy dataset with threshold 0.8 are 0.9649 and 0.9996 separately. Besides, the
average cross-validation AUROC and AUPRC values for the triplex DNA sites poten-
tial prediction are 0.8705 and 0.9671 separately. The general good performances of Tri-
plexFPP illustrate its effectiveness in triplex forming potential prediction, and could
provide references to the IncRNA function exploration. Furthermore, we also briefly
summarize the cis and trans targeting of triplexes IncRNAs, which may provide some
insights to the exploration of IncRNA binding mechanisms.

Implementation

Dataset

Triplex IncRNA prediction dataset

The positive data for triplex IncRNA prediction is collected in 2 ways. On one hand, we
extracted the IncRNAs according to the TriplexRNA regions (DNA:RNA triplex forming
peaks in RNA) reported in the work of Sentiirk et al. [16] by considering both Solid Phase
Reversible Immobilization-based paramagnetic bead size selection and immunopurifi-
cation with anti-DNA antibody RNA separation in Hela S3 cell. We used GENCODE
release 33 IncRNA annotation [21] to extract the IncRNAs that cover the TriplexRNA
regions and obtained 476 unique samples in this way. We named these IncRNAs as tri-
plexlncRNA. On the other hand, we also collected IncRNAs that are verified by either
in vivo or in vitro assays to from triplexes with DNA from the peer-viewed publications.
These IncRNAs are named as reported triplex IncRNA, including MEG3 [7], PARTICL
[8], MIR1O0HG [11], FENDRR [22], and HOTAIR [10]. All the variants of the reported
triplex IncRNA were taken into consideration. The total number of reported triplex
IncRNA is 159.

Since our goal is to predict the most likely triplex-forming IncRNAs in practice from
the IncRNAs owning triplex forming capacities predicted by computational methods, we
used TDF [20] to further filter the data. When evaluating the triplex forming potential of
the above 635 IncRNAs with the whole gene promoters (except for chromosome Y and
M) with TDF (default parameters), 104 of them do not contain DNA Binding Domains
(DBDs) with powerful Triplex Forming Oligonucleotide (TFO) support. There are two
possible explanations for the phenomenon of low triplex forming capacity obtained from
TDF in collected positive data: i) for reported triplex IncRNA, each IncRNA gene may
have multiple transcripts with splice variants, but maybe not all of their variants have
the abilities to form the triplex with DNA, and ii) for triplexlncRNA, the overlap regions
between R-Loop and TriplexRNA regions cannot be confirmed as triplex forming or not
[16]. To assure the data reliability, we deleted the 104 IncRNAs with low triplex forming
capacity and finally got 531 samples in the positive dataset.

The negative samples are collected following the same filter rules as that of positive.
After removing the IncRNAs in our original positive dataset from GENCODE annota-
tion, we evaluated the triplex forming potential of all remaining IncRNAs with the whole
gene promoters (except for chrY and chrM) by TDF. We only kept the IncRNAs with
at least one powerful TFO supported DBD and at least 123 DNA Binding Sites (DBSs)
(the smallest number of DBSs is 123 in positive data). From the qualified IncRNAs, we
Zhang et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:522 Page 4 of 13

further removed one IncRNA with letter ‘N’ in its sequence and the variants of IncRNA
MALAT1 which is reported to form RNA-RNA triplex [23]. Finally, the negative dataset
contains 36,021 IncRNAs which have comparable triplex forming abilities as the positive
data.

We also prepared two more datasets with removed redundancies. We used the CD-
HIT [24] to remove the redundancy in each class of the original dataset with threshold
of 0.9 and 0.8 separately. The positive and negative data amounts in two removed redun-
dancy datasets are 384 and 28,012, and 286 and 22,681, respectively.

Triplex DNA sites potential prediction dataset

To predict triplex-forming sites in DNA on the basis of experimental data, we adopted
the TriplexDNA regions (DNA:RNA triplex forming peaks in DNA) obtained from [16]
as positive data. These RNA-associated DNAs are enriched by an unbiased approach.
After removing 5 samples containing the letter ’N’ in their sequences, the final positive
dataset size is 2542. The negative data is selected as the random regions in promoters.
We downloaded all ensembl annotated promoters [25], from which we generated 12,735
regions (5 times amount of originally positive data). These regions were obtained by ran-
domly selecting chromosomes (except chrY and chrM) and DNA regions with the same
lengths as TriplexDNA. The sequence data for both positive and negative is extracted
from the DNA minus strand.

Feature extraction

Two types of sequence-related feature extraction strategies are considered here: k-mer
and kmerscore. Both two types of strategies have been successfully applied to classifi-
cation problems in RNA [26, 27]. K-mer is a popular method to transform a sequence
into a vector, it counts the frequencies of single or multiple nucleotide compositions in a
sequence and represents the sequence into a 4 * dimensional vector. K-mer features can

be calculated as

Total number of k neighboring nucleic acids (i)

kmer(i) = ake

(1)
where kmer(i) is the frequency of the ith nucleotide composition in all 4 * possibilities,
and the denominator 1 — k + 1 represents the total number of all possible k neighbor-
ing nucleic acids in a sequence with length nv. For example, in the 3-mer circumstance,
k = 3, considering sequence S = AAAAC, whose n = 5, its frequencies under the nucle-
otide composition of AAA and AAC are 2/3 and 1/3 separately, while the frequencies for
other 3-mer compositions like AAG, et al. are 0.

kmerscore is an overall measure of the k-mer nucleotide composition bias in a
sequence, it is obtained from k-mer features. To calculate it, firstly, the k-mer features for
all sequences need to be calculated, then the mean k-mer vectors from the positive and
negative dataset are obtained from the corresponding k-mer features separately, which
are represented as Myos (hj) and Myeg (hj), where i = 1,2,..., qk Finally, for a nucleotide
sequence S = s1S2...S, with k-mer sequence S = Myhz...hy,_,%4 1, the kmerscore can be

represented as

Model construction

We developed an integrated machine learning program called TriplexFPP (Triplex Forming
Potential Prediction) in triplex forming potential prediction. It consists of two individual
models, including triplex IncRNA prediction model and triplex DNA sites potential predic-
tion model.

We adopted the 2-layer Convolutional Neural Network to construct the models, which
can effectively learn the high-level features. The detailed description of the structure and
parameters of the model can be found at section of Initial training of TriplexFPP below.
As the positive dataset sizes and negative dataset sizes in triplex IncRNA prediction and
triplex DNA sites prediction are imbalanced with ratios around 1:68 and 1:5 separately, to
avoid the model bias, we applied the random down-sampling technique during the training
process. The negative training data were randomly selected as the same amount as positive
training data. Due to the extremely small positive dataset size in triplex IncRNA prediction,
i.e. 531, we also applied oversampling on this dataset. Because the positive data in triplex
IncRNA prediction are collected from two sources whose amounts are in a ratio around
2.5 to 1 (triplexlncRNA to reported triplex IncRNA), to force the model to learn the global
features for all positive data rather than the common features for the data from the major-
ity type, i.e. triplexlncRNA, we assigned more weights to the weak type data, i.e. reported
triplex IncRNA, during augmenting the positive data in the training process, and we named

this practice as the weighted bagging strategy.

Model evaluation

To demonstrate the model performances, the evaluation criteria of accuracy (Acc), sensi-
tivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and AUROC are used. Besides, criteria in evaluating imbalance
data are also adopted, including AUPRC, F1-score, and harmonic mean (Hm). The equa-

tions for calculating the above criteria are listed below.

Results

Initial training of TriplexFPP

Each input sequence is represented into a fix-length 90-dim vector by con-
sidering both kmer (k=1,2,3, number of feature = 84) and  kmerscore
(k = 1 —6, number of feature = 6) features. The influences of the k-mer and kmerscore
features to TriplexFPP can be found at Additional file 1: Fig. S1. We use the mean k-mer
feature values from training data to calculate the kmerscore features of both training and
test data in the corresponding split to exclude any information from test data.

The parameters in TriplexFPP, such as the number of convolutional layer, the kernel
size, the activation function, etc. are determined according to the corresponding random
split datasets in two individual models. Each time we change the value of one parameter
while keeping other parameters fixed, and then select the one that achieves the highest
value of Sn as the final choice for that parameter. The setting of the parameters and the
corresponding performances for triplex IncRNA prediction model and triplex DNA sites
prediction model are shown in Additional file 1: Figs S2 and S3 separately. The detailed
architectures and parameters for TriplexFPP can be found in Fig. 1.

Evaluation of triplex IncRNA prediction

In this section, we evaluate the triplex IncRNA prediction model in TriplexFPP regard to
its ability in predicting the most likely triplex-forming IncRNA from the IncRNAs own-
ing triplex forming capability predicted by the computation methods.

We first visualize the nucleotide compositions of IncRNA sequences in our positive
dataset (triplexlncRNA and reported triplex IncRNA) and negative dataset (Additional
file 1: Fig. $4). The nucleotide compositions for the reported triplex IncRNAs and the
negative IncRNAs are more consistent, from which nucleotide A and T taking up heavier
percentages; whereas the triplexIncRNA follows a different pattern, whose sequences are

mainly CG rich. Because the amount of triplexlncRNA is larger than that of reported tri-
plex IncRNA in our positive dataset, to ensure the model to learn the high-level features
for all positive data rather than the sequence composition features of triplexlncRNA,
we assign more weights to the reported triplex IncRNA when augmenting the positive
data in the training process. We triple the positive training data with the weighted bag-
ging strategy, where two-thirds of them is bagged from the original positive training
data directly and one-third of them is extra bagged from the reported triplex IncRNA.
We compare our method with baseline models like Deep Neural Network (NN), Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting. The param-
eters for the NN model are determined as the ones with the best Sn value among several
choices on random split training and test datasets, and the parameters for other baseline
models are determined as the optimal ones by cross-validated grid-search over a param-
eter grid based on the criteria of Recall. The candidate parameters and the final deter-
mined parameters for each baseline model are recorded in Additional file 1: Table S1.
The box and whisker plots for fivefold cross validation are demonstrated for all models
in Fig. 2a, where the negative training data are randomly selected as the same amount of
augmented positive training data from the 4 training folds in each validation.

With the mission of finding the most likely triplex-forming IncRNAs in practice,
although Gradient Boosting method realizes the best Acc and Fl-score values, its Sn
values mainly concentrate between 87.74 and 92.45%. Conversely, the Sn values for CNN
model range from 93.40 to 97.17%, concentrating at a high-value region, which indicates
its superiority to baseline models on the model performance. Besides, the overall high
values of other evaluation metrices in CNN model, e.g. 98.35% of average Acc, 0.9926
of average AUROC, 0.9999 of average AUPRC, 0.992 of average Fl-score, and 0.969 of
average Hm, further illustrate the effectiveness of our CNN model in TriplexFPP in the
IncRNA triplex forming potential prediction.

Zhang et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2020) 21:522 Page 8 of 13

However, one issue for the above fivefold cross validation is that the high perfor-
mance may be caused by the high data similarity between training and test. In our posi-
tive dataset, the 531 samples relate to 135 genes (Additional file 1: Figure $5), where 57
genes owning two or more variants. The different variants from the same IncRNA gene
can share high sequence composition similarities, thereby leading to a good prediction
result. To evaluate whether the model is powerful enough in predicting IncRNA tri-
plex forming potential, we further execute fivefold cross validation on the datasets with
removed redundancy and carry out the leave-out validation.

We compare the performances of CNN model on datasets without removing redun-
dancy, removing redundancy with threshold of 0.9, and removing redundancy with
threshold of 0.8. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 2b. Although the average perfor-
mances on the data with removed redundancy are slightly lower than that of without
removing redundancy, the values in evaluation matrices on the removed redundancy
datasets remain at high levels. For example, in removed redundancy datasets with
threshold of 0.9, the AUROC and AUPRC values range from 0.9637 to 0.9880 and 0.9993
to 0.9998 separately; in removed redundancy datasets with threshold of 0.8, the AUROC
and AUPRC values range from 0.9497 to 0.9809 and 0. 9994 to 0.9998 separately.

For the leave-out validation, we select four IncRNAs with the most amounts of vari-
ants as the test data, including MIR100HG, PVT1, LINC00963, and MEG3. Their vari-
ants amounts are 87, 73, 52, and 46, respectively. The four IncRNAs follow different data
sources, PVT1 and LINC00963 belong to triplexlncRNA, and MIRIOOHG and MEG3
belong to reported triplex IncRNA. In each leave-out validation, we select one IncRNA
and use all of its variants as positive test data, while using all the remaining positive
IncRNAs as the training data. The training and test process are repeated 5 times, each
time the negative training data are randomly selected as the same amount with positive
training data from one of the fivefold cross validation split above, and the negative test
data are the above fivefold cross validation test data.

When leaving IncRNA PVT1 and LINC00963 out, our model predicts all their variants
correctly as positive. The average AUROC values for PVT1 and LINC00963 are 0.9996
and 0.9968 separately. However, when leaving IncRNA MIR100HG and MEG3 out, their
average AUROC values are 0.6594 and 0.3220 separately, which are a bit low. One pos-
sible reason for the different performances between triplexlncRNA and reported triplex
IncRNAs is that, in triplexlncRNA, we adopt the variants which are overlapped with
experimentally verified triplex forming regions; whereas in the reported triplex IncRNA,
we adopt all the variants of that gene, however, maybe not all of these variants could
form triplex in practice. Interestingly, when we only use six kmerscore features to train
leave-out model for MEG3, its average AUROC value could increase to 0.7610, but this
phenomenon is not found when leaving MIR100HG out.

Evaluation of triplex DNA sites potential prediction

We use the fivefold cross validation to evaluate the performance of triplex DNA sites
potential prediction model in TriplexFPP, and compare it with other baseline models
(Fig. 3a). The determination of the parameters for baseline models in predicting tri-
plex DNA sites follows the same procedure as that of triplex IncRNA prediction. The

candidate parameters and the final determined parameters for each baseline model

are recorded in Additional file 1: Table $2. The overall performance of CNN is better
than that of baseline models, whose average AUROC and AUPRC values are 0.8705 and
0.9671 separately; whereas for baselines methods, the average values of AUROC located
in the scope of 0.8635 to 0.8667, and the average values of AUPRC are from 0.9642 to
0.9660, respectively. We then visualize the predicted probability scores of CNN model
in each fold (Fig. 3b and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Although some samples are wrongly
predicted, the predicted probability scores for most positive data concentrate at around
value of 1. This phenomenon indicates that our model can predict most data correctly
with high confidence.

Besides, the region of 649—708 in HOTAIR sequence is verified to form DNA:RNA tri-
plex [10], our model correctly predicts this site as the triplex forming type. Overall, with
the limited data, our results demonstrate that TriplexFPP can effectively distinguish the
in vivo assay defined triplex-forming DNA sites from those background sites with only
nucleotide sequence features as the input.

TriplexFPP model interpretation

Take the first fold validation in two models in TriplexFPP as examples, we plot the
average feature values for each class in the format of heatmap before training (original
features), trained after one CNN layer, and trained after two CNN layers in Fig. 4 and
Additional file 1: Fig. S7. The kmerscore features (the first six features in original fea-
tures) show obvious differences in two classes, which indicate that the nucleotide com-
positions have different preferences with regard to the positions in positive and negative
data. The kmerscore features also lead to different convolution values after trained with
only one CNN layer. However, for the remaining features, the differences of their convo-
lutional values between two classes do not show noticeable differences until trained after
2 CNN layers.

In cis/in trans triplex-forming IncRNA: an exploration

The IncRNA can form triplex structures with DNA both in cis and in trans, but if differ-
ences exist between cis and trans targeting of triplexes IncRNAs remains unknown [28].
In this work, we explore the cis and trans targeting of triplexes IncRNAs following two

data sources.

From the TDF results between each triplexlncRNA and TriplexDNA, 238 IncRNAs in
triplexlncRNAs show both in cis and in trans interactions with DNA, whose in cis bind-
ing numbers range from 1 to 2450; whereas the other 141 IncRNAs only show in trans
interactions with DNA (Additional file 1: Fig. $8). Moreover, for a certain IncRNA gene,
its variants may show different binding patterns. Among all 130 genes related to triplexl-
ncRNAs, 26 genes contain variants either belong to the type of in cis and in trans inter-
actions or only in trans interactions (Additional file 1: Figs. S9 and S10).

Besides, for those reported triplex IncRNA, we collect their binding information from
the published work in Additional file 1: Table S3 [7, 8, 10, 11, 23, 29]. According to the

corresponding experiments, the IncRNA HOTAIR, MEG3, and MIR100HG show in
trans binding, and PARTICLE and FENDRR show in cis binding.

Discussion

LncRNA can exert functions via interacting with DNA. Among all kinds of interactions,
DNA:RNA triplex formation is still less understood to us due to the limited number of
validation assays. Although varieties of canonical rule-based computational methods
have been developed to predict the triplex forming potential for ncRNA and DNA sites,
they identify a large number of IncRNAs which can form triplex. However, the limited
number of experimentally verified data indicates that maybe not all of them can form
triplex in practice. Besides, those computational methods only theoretically calculate the
triplex potential, while do not consider any in vivo and in vitro verified data.

Trained with the data obtained from in vitro and in vivo assays, our newly developed
program, namely TriplexFPP, exhibits good prediction performances. Its triplex IncRNA
prediction model works effectively by achieving high average scores of evaluation matri-
ces in the fivefold cross validation. For example, in the removed redundancy datasets
with threshold 0.8, the average cross fold validation value of Acc, AUROC, AUPRC,
fl-score, and Hm are 95.28%, 0.9649, 0.9996, 0.976, and 0.904, respectively. Besides, the
triplex DNA sites potential prediction model in TriplexFPP also works effectively. In the
fivefold cross validation, its average AUROC and AUPRC values are 0.8705 and 0.9671
separately. And most data are predicted correctly with high confidences.

We also summarized the cis and trans targeting of triplexes IncRNAs following the dif-
ferent data sources collected in this work, which may provide some insights to the explo-
ration of IncRNA cis and trans binding mechanisms.

However, one limitation for this work is that the positive data amount is small. And
also, some data in our negative class may belong to the positive but are not yet verified.
Therefore, we expect more data to be explored to help implementing this tool. Besides,
a small fraction IncRNA in our collected data may belong to the R-Loop forming type,

which may influence the results somehow.

Conclusion

We proposed a deep learning based program in DNA:RNA triplex formation prediction,
namely TriplexFPP. TriplexFPP predicts the most likely triplex-forming IncRNAs from
all the IncRNAs with computationally defined triplex forming capacities, and it also pre-
dicts the potential of a DNA site to become a triplex. TriplexFPP narrows the scope of
possible IncRNAs in forming triplex compared to those mathematic statistic methods.
We expect the TriplexFPP can provide insights and references to help to decipher the
codes of the IncRNA functions.
