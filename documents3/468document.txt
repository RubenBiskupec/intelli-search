Abstract

In this paper we discuss piece-wise permutation polynomials (PP). The method is
by combining the AGW lemma and module structure, and we get a generalized five
lemma. Then we apply the results to additive and multiplicative structures of finite
fields. This gives a unified treatment and a framework of extensive existing PPs in the
literature. More precisely, we deal with PPs of the following forms

(1) [Multiplicative Structure] x@w(x a), where a € N, dig” — 1, u(x) € Fy [x].

(2) [Additive Structure] L; + u(L2 + 5), where Lj, L2 are linearized polynomials,
u(x) € Fgn[x], 6 € Fan. If Lo is the trace function Tr(x), this concerns both
additive and multiplicative structures.

1 Introduction

Let F, denote the finite field of characteristic p with gq elements, and Fj be the set
of nonzero elements of F,. A permutation polynomial (PP) over F, is a polynomial
over IF, that induces a permutation on IF, with its evaluation on the field. A linearized
polynomial or g-polynomial [1] over Fgn has the form L(x) = a ajxd € Fgn[x].
Since L(x) is ,-linear, it is easily seen that L(x) permutes Ign if and only if the only
root of L(x) in Fn is the zero element. Permutation polynomials over finite fields have
been an interesting subject of study for many years, and have applications in coding
theory, cryptography, combinatorial design theory, and many other areas of mathe-

matics and engineering. For properties and applications of permutation polynomials
and linearized polynomials, please see [1].

For the convenient applications of PP, people are interested only in PPs of nice
form, for example, sparse PPs or PPs having good algebraic structures. Since there are
two algebraic structures in finite fields, that is, additive structure and multiplicative
structure, there are two kinds of interesting PPs. PPs having additive stuctures often
have the form L;(x) + u(L2(x)), where L(x) and L2(x) are linearized polynomi-
als. PPs having multiplicative stuctures often have the form x7 H(x%—!)/4), where
d|q — 1. Both kinds have been studied intensively in recent years, [2—7]. Li et al.
[8] presented some new permutation polynomial of the form (xP —x+6)°+ L(x)
over Ign, where L(x) is a linearized polynomial. Fernando and Hou [9] provided a
piecewise construction of permutation polynomials over finite fields. Wang [10] used
cyclotomy to construct new classes of permutation polynomials of large indices. For
a comprehensive survey of present progress, please refer to [11] and the references
therein.

There are vast piecewise PPs [12—20] constructed based on the following powerful
AGW lemma.

Lemma 1.1 (AGW Lemma) Let A, B, A and B be finite sets with #B = #B and
le ff: A> Bf: A—> B,aa: A> A, ap: B—= B be maps satisfying
mpo f = f omg. If ma, and mp are surjective, then the following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) f is bijective,

(Il) f is injective and f is injective on | (b), for everybe B.

Although AGW lemma is a powerful tool in studying PPs, presently, PPs of both
algebraic structures are studied seperately. In this paper, inspired by a note in [11], we
try to deal with these two kinds PPs in the same context. We combine AGW lemma and
module stucture, by making A into A according to the module structure. Then AGW
lemma can be regarded as a generalization of the five lamma. In this introduction, the
lemma is discussed in full generality, then it is applied to PPs over finite fields. Since
any finite field jn is an F,-module (linear vector space), and Fon isa Z/(q" — 1)Z-

module (with scalar multiplication k oa = ak), our results give a unified treatment
and a framework of extensive existing PPs in the literature. More precisely, we could
deal with polynomials of the following forms

(1) [Multiplicative Structure] x@w(x a), where a € N, dig” — 1, u(x) € Fy [x].
(2) [Additive Structure] L; + u(L2 + 5), where Lj, L2 are linearized polynomials,
u(x) € Fgn[x], 6 € Fan. If Lo is the trace function Tr(x), this concerns both
additive and multiplicative structures. (In many cases in the literature, 5 could be
eliminated by translations, and it won’t affect the bijectivity of those polynomials,
that is, in those cases, L; + u(L2 + 4) are PPs iff L; + u(L2) are PPs. [21])
In the remaining of the introduction, we discuss our result under general module
structures. We first formulate the following

Definition 1.1 Let R be aring, M be a free R-module, and W be an R-submodule of
M.Amap f : M — M 1s called a semi-homomorphism over M with respect to W
if the following two conditions are satisfied:

Q) Springer
Sao Paulo Journal of Mathematical Sciences (2020) 14:665-674 667

(1) flw is an R-module homomorphism;
(2) f(m+w) = f(m) + f(w), Vm € M, Vue W.

We denote by W-Hom(M) the set of all the semi-homomorphisms over M with respect
to W.

Recall that a non-zero element a € [gn is called an a-linear translator for the
mapping f : Fyn > F, if f(x + ua) — f(x) = ua holds for any x ¢€ Fy anda
fixed a € If,. Therefore the above definition is a generalization of maps with a linear
translator. The latter maps were used to construct large classes of PPs by Kyureghyan
[22] and Cepak et al. [23].

Let R be a ring and W Cc M be R-modules. Clearly, every semihomomorphism
f : M — M with respect to W can be obtained as follows: Leth : W — M be an
R-map, let C be a set of coset representatives of W in M such that 0 € C, and let
g : C — M be an arbitrary function such that g(O) = 0. Define f : M — M by
f(c+w) = g(c) +h(w), where c € Candw € W.Ifh: W — M can be extended
to an R-map h : M -— M, which is the case if M is an injective R-module, then
f(c tw) = g(c)h(c) + h(c + w), where g(c)h(c) = u(c + W) for some function
ax: M—> W/M withu(0+ W) = 0. Hence f =h+uoz, wherex : M > M/W
is the canonical homomorphism. Thus we have the following lemma

Lemma1.2 Let R be a ring, M be an R-module, W be an R-submodule of M,

 

0—+Ww—“+M “>+@Q >Q0 bea short exact sequence, u: Q ~ M

f =L+uomzm € W-Hom(M). If M is an injective R-module, every element of
W-Hom(M) is of this form.

Proof Itis trivial that f|jw = L|w isan R-module homomorphism. Vm € M,Vw € W,
f(m+w) = Lim+w)+tuor(m+w) = Lim) +uonm(m)+ L(w) +uo0r(w) =
f(m) + f(w). Oo

Lemma 1.3 Let R be a PID, M be a free R-module, W be an R-submodule of M and
f € W-Hom(M). Then for two short exact sequences of R-modules

Moreover, given f|w is injective then f is injective (surjective, bijective) iff f is
injective (surjective, bijective).

Proof For any g € Qj, there is ana € M such that m;(a) = q, define f : g
m2(f(a)). If my(a) = m(b), thena —b € W and f(a) = f((a—b)+b) =
f(a —b) + f(b) € f(b) + f(W), then z12( f (a)) = m2(f (b)), which indicates f 1S
well-defined and the diagram is commutative.

(1) Suppose f is injective. If f(i(a)) = f (1 (b)), then 12(f (a)) = m2(f (b)),
so f(a) — f(b) € f(W). Let f(c) = f(a) — f(b) for some c € W, then
f(a) = f(b) + fo) = ft +c). Since f is injective, we have a = b +c, and
therefore 7; (a) = m7\(b +c) = 7 (b), that is fi is injective.

Now suppose f is injective. If f(a) = f(b), then f (1 (a)) = m2(f(a)) =
m2(f(b)) = f (711 (b)). Since f is injective, we have z1(a) = 2(b) and thus
a—bew. f(a)= fia—b+b)= flia—b)+ fib) = f(a —b)+ f(a), so
f(a —b) =0= f(0), and f|w is injective, soa — b = 0. So f is injective.

(2) Suppose f is surjective. Since m9 is surjective, then f2, = 22 f is surjective, and

therefore f is surjective.
Now suppose f is surjective. Vb € M, since fz is surjective, there exits a € M,
such that fm1(a) = m2(b). Let b' = b — f(a), then 22(b’) = 0, sob’ € f(W).
Let a’ € W, such that f(a’) = b’, thenb = f(a)+ f(a’) = f(a+da’), so f is
surjective. Oo

The following corollary discusses the bijectivity of the simplest semi-homomorph-
isms. Usually, complicated cases can be reduced to these simplest cases.

2 Applications to PPs over finite fields

Since IFgn is an IF,-linear vector space, and Fon is a Z/(q” — 1)Z-module, there are
two applications of the results in Sect. 1.

Q) Springer
Sao Paulo Journal of Mathematical Sciences (2020) 14:665-674 669

2.1 Under multiplicative structure

Let Fy be a finite field, write F*? = {x¢ : x € F*}, d € N, then the Z/(q — 1)Z-
submodules of Fy are Fx , where d is a positive divisor of g — 1, and the corresponding
projections are 2(x) = x?. The Z/(q — 1)Z-module homomorphisms from Fj to Fj
are L(x) =x¢,d EN.

Lemma 2.1 (Expressions of Multiplicative Semi-Homomorphisms) Let d|q — 1, then

F*4-Hom(F*) = {fau: Fy > Fg; xb x“u(x'T)la EN, u € F,[x], wu) = 1}.

Proof Consider the short exact sequence of Z/(g — 1)Z-modules

*(q—1)/d

where Fy is an injective Z/(q — 1)Z-module. The conclusions follow from Lemma
1.2. u

Lemma 2.2 (Normalizations of Multiplicative Semi-Homomorphisms) Let d|g — 1,
fe F*4-Hom(F*), then there exist b, e € N with e| a and gcd(b, gq — 1) = 1, such
that

(f(x)? = xeulxt) (mod x4 — x).

Proof Write d’ = (q—1)/d.Let f(x) = x“u'(x@ ) for somea € Nandu'(x) € Fy [x]
with u’(1) = 1. Let e = gcd(a, da’), a’ = a/e, then gcd(a’, d’/e) = 1.

By Dirichlet therem, there are infinitely many primes in the sequence {a’+(d’/e)t :
t € N}. Choose a prime c = a’ + (d'/e)tg in it such that it is coprime to g — 1, then
a =a'e =ce—d'tg. Let b be the least nonnegative residue of c~'! modulo g — 1, then
ba = bce — bd'tp = e — bd'ty (mod g — 1), therefore

Cf (xy)? = (x4! (x)?

where u(x) = x?40—t0(y'(x))?. Oo

The following lemma is a well-known result due to Zieve [21]. For consistency, we
still copy it here and give a proof based on our method.

with u(1) = 1. Then f(x) = x©u(x @ ) permutes Fy iffe = 1 and g(x) = xu(x) a

Proof Ifa ¢ F, suchthata® = 1,thena*? = land f(a) = a%u(a‘t ) = 1 = f (1).
Thus if f is bijective then the equation x© = | has only one solution x = | in Fy,
which indicates e = |. The remaining of the theorem follows by applying Corollary
1.1 to the following commutative diagram.

2.2 Under additive structure

Ign is an F,-linear vector space. Any I*,-subspace W of Ign has a complement space
W©, and Fj admits the decomposition Fyn = W @ WS.

Lemma 2.6 Let W be an Fy-subspace of Fgn with W© its complement space, 1 :
Ign — W° be the projection. Then f €¢ W-Hom(F,") iff there exist an Fg -linear map
L and a map u over Fgn with u(O) = 0, such that f = L +uoz and f\w = L|w.
Further, if f |w is bijective, then L could be required to be bijective.

Proof Consider the short exact sequence of F,-modules

0 —> W —<> Fn > we —~0,

where Ign is an injective F,,-module. Then apply Lemma 1.2. Oo

Lemma 2.7 Let @ : Fan — Fan be an F,-linear map, m : Fgn — im(@) be the
projection, then there exists an invertible Fg-linear map $09 : Fan — Fgn such that

p= oon.

Corollary 2.1 Let @ : Fyn — Fgn be an F,-linear map, then f € ker(¢)-Hom(Fg~)
iff there exist an F,-linear map L and a map u over Fgn with u(Q) = 0, such that
f=L+uo0 ®@, and f \ker(¢) = Llker(g). Further, if f \ker(g) 18 bijective, then L could
be required to be invertible.

Theorem 2.4 Let L, ¢ be F,-linear maps and u a map over Fgn with u(0) = 0. Then
f =L+u0o ¢ permutes Fg iff the following three conditions hold

(1) Llker(g) 8 injective;

(2) There exist an invertible Fy-linear map L' and a map u' over Fg with u'(0) = 0
such that L |ker(d) = Lhker(g) and f = L’'+u'od;

(3) g=lim@ +0 L’"| ou’: im(¢) > im(@) is bijective.

Proof We prove the necessity of the conditions only, since the sufficiency of the con-
ditions could be deduced from the proof.

By Lemma 2.7, ¢ have adecompostion @ = $907, where ¢o 1s a bijective F,-linear
map.

Q) Springer
Sao Paulo Journal of Mathematical Sciences (2020) 14:665-674 673

Item (1) is trivial. By extending L|ker(g) to Fgn linearly and bijectively, we get an
invertible linear map L’. Since ker(#) C ker(L — L’), by Lemma 2.7, we have the
decompostion L — L’ = ug o d. Then

f=Lituod¢d

Since L/"!o f = len + L'"! ou’ o gj oT is bijective, by Lemma 1.1, go =

is bijective. O

Corollary 2.2 Let @ : Fgn — Fgn be an F,-linear map, then x + u(b(x)) permutes
Fan iff x + p(u(x)) permutes im(@).

Remark 2.1 Let (x) be a linear map over Fyn and 6 € im(@), say 6 = $(a@) for some
a € Fan. Then u(o(x)+6)+x = u(o(x +a@)) +x. This indicates that u(o(x) +4) +x
permutes Fan iff u(p(x)) + x permutes Ign. Further analyses of the impact of 6 need
the information of the coefficients of u(x). There are many examples in the literature
that consider 6 in this case [13, Theorem 1], [17, Theorem 4], [19, Theorem 5.1], [24,
Theorem 2.1], in fact, it can be eliminated by translations.
