Those who do not move, do not notice their (supply)
chains—inconvenient lessons from disruptions related to COVID-19

An Italian comedian once joked:

“Americans buy thousands of tons of Danish cookies,
and Danes buy thousands of tons of American cookies,
with a coming and going of ships, airplanes, trains.
Is this sensible? Maybe it 1s, because the cookies are
different. But why wouldn’t they just swap recipes?!

The target of this joke is ‘competitive’ imports. These
are commodities that an economy could, and indeed does,
produce to some extent, and which the 2019 coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic has raised concerns about in the con-
text of national security and healthcare.

A double-whammy of supply disruption and unprece-
dented demand hit most healthcare systems. Firstly, the lock-
down exposed the extent to which the supply of medicines
depends on a handful of locations. An example is the global
reliance on China for the manufacture of APIs — active phar-
maceutical ingredients (Anonymous 2020).

Secondly, the rapid escalation of severe and critical
cases is a reminder that the resources available to hospitals
and labs are limited. An example is the intensification of
COVID-19 testing campaigns. Indirectly, this caused abnor-
mal demand for reagents to extract the virus’ nucleic acid
from samples — in short: RNA extraction kits (Mehta 2020).
Most countries could not meet this demand in the absence
of a home-grown manufacturing base (Smyth et al. 2020).

The examples above are not about glamorous, ‘high
value’ items. Yet they caused national security-level distress.

In hindsight, it is easy to draw conclusions. At excep-
tional times, we wonder why everything is not on hand in
our backyard—even the cheapest face mask, lab reagent,

and API. At any other time, we wonder why medicines are
pricey, and why healthcare spending is not in check.

It is tempting to look for definitive answers about the
risk of depending on a foreign manufacturing base. But is
it reasonable to assume that a 100% homegrown healthcare
supply is possible? Is it reasonable to expect ‘always on’
readiness end-to-end — from manufacturing to the patient,
in both normal and exceptional operating conditions? At the
least, no one has figured it out yet.

Instead, I offer a few, inconvenient lessons we might
consider learning. Roughly, these can be grouped into three
topic areas: (1) Choosing sourcing locations. (2) Establish-
ing supply dependencies through outsourcing and offshoring
decisions. (3) Matching supply to a changing, often erratic
demand.

The reminder is loosely based on previous work on
pharmaceutical supply risk carried out within a recently
concluded collaborative research project on Reconfiguring
Medicines End-to-end Supply—ReMediES (Geyman et al.
2020).

1 Choosing sourcing locations

Obviously, there are textbook reasons to manufacture off-
shore. These include foreign market penetration and cost
containment — typically labour (see e.g., Dornier et al. 1998:
p. 258). Outsourcing, foreign direct investment and other
mechanisms support these classic location strategies — at
least until other developments undermine their benefits.
In 2017, a hurricane gave the finishing blow to the already
fragile economy of Puerto Rico. Until then, tax breaks had
secured the presence of major pharmaceutical manufacturers
for decades (Smith 2019). In this case, too, medicines supply
felt the hit, all the way to patient care (Barrera et al. 2018).

So, what other factors determine a good manufacturing
location?

Lesson 1: The pandemic started where it was supposed
to start. As Silver (2013: Ch.7) points out, influenza virus
epidemics are recurrent events. Repeatedly, their diffusion
behaviour eludes predictions and baffles decision-makers.
Yet, they do not come out of the blue. Before becoming
global pandemics, dangerous viral flu strains originate in
conditions that are relatively easy to identify. According to
Silver, these include the following: (1) A diet in which pig
is a Staple. (2) Geographical conditions for pigs and seafar-
ing birds to intermingle. (3) Areas with poor hygiene and
sanitation conditions, that help the transmission of animal
viruses to humans. Countries like China check all the boxes
above. From the viewpoint of facility location or sourcing
decision, this is good to know. Except these countries also
enjoy ‘textbook’ comparative advantages as manufacturing
locations.

Lesson 2: Location-specific issues can be a challenge
for back-of-the-envelope calculations. Reasons for ‘vet-
ting’ specific locations go beyond extreme, albeit recur-
ring, events like pandemics and hurricanes. Even before
COVID-19, the dependability of Chinese and Indian API
manufacturers was low. In 69% of cases, an adverse regu-
latory inspection could result in a medicines shortage up to

D) Springer

four years later (Geyman et al. 2020). In principle, getting
more insights can shift future location decisions.

But this depends on which objectives a supply chain is
designed to achieve. Not long before the pandemic, the
US explored taking on a leading role in medicine manu-
facturing. This was based on achieving a more reliable,
responsive and safe medicines supply (Woodcock 2019).
The range of aspects to consider for candidate locations
is wide. Think of corruption (Xiao et al. 2018) and water
stress (Settanni et al. 2019) to name a few. Probably
enough to start questioning strategies based on back-of-
the-envelope calculations.

Takeaway 1: How to know where specific APIs are made.
Let’s consider a common API: paracetamol. Where is it
made? Over a decade ago, we could find the answer in spe-
cialised industry and trade publications (Kirschner 2003).
Now, market intelligence resources are sold dearly. Thanks
to EU regulations, some information about manufactures
and importers is in the public domain. In Fig. | I tap into
regulatory data to map out where the UK gets its paraceta-
mol API from. There is no European supply since Rhodia
closed its facility in 2009 due to poor profitability (Anony-
mous 2009). Paracetamol is now recommended for treating
milder COVID-19 symptoms. As demand spiked in the UK,
distributors feared that manufacturing issues might follow,
Al & SOCIETY (2020) 35:1065-1071

causing shortages (Andalo 2020). The footprint shown in
Fig. | may help explain why.

2 Establishing a web of supply
dependencies

We all have heard the statistics. China accounts for 14% of
API and 8% of drug production in the US (FDA 2019: p 29).
For the EU, press reports indicate that overseas dependence
is as high as 80% (Laurent 2020) or 90% (Brunsden and
Peel 2020) considering non-proprietary drugs. Loathing
dependence on foreign production, both the EU and US are
reconsidering their domestic API manufacturing capability
(Geyman 2020). Few bother to add that it has been this way
for longer than we think. Is the industry heading forwards
or backwards?

Lesson 3: Over-dependency hides in plain sight. Scratch-
ing the surface, the claim of 90% dependence for the EU
originated 12 years ago (EC 2020). The figure is an impre-
cise reading of an assessment developed for the Falsified
Medicines Directive (CEC 2008). We also forget that until
the 1980s the pharmaceutical industry was vertically inte-
grated; since then, activities outside R&D and marketing
are no longer core (Rees 2011). Evidence suggests that the
manufacture of European APIs and intermediates has moved
east since the end of the Cold War. This includes central and
eastern Europe (Boswell 2007) and China (Boswell 2004).
In the 2000s, overcapacity and low profitability kicked in
due to slow demand and the proliferation of Chinese and
Indian manufacturers (Pollak and Vouillamoz 2013). Single-
country dependency did not happen overnight. It even made
sense at some point.

Lesson 4: Successful reshoring decisions are primarily
market-driven. Should we be wary of the current frenzy
to bring manufacturing back? According to a survey, most
businesses reshore to improve responsiveness, and get closer
to customers (Srai and Ané 2016). Surprisingly, resilience is
not as important a reason as one might expect. At least until
now. Some reshoring ambitions might be easier to fulfil, as
manufacturing technology has moved past large batch cam-
paigns of blockbuster drugs. In particular, innovative con-
tinuous pharmaceutical processing enables shrinking factory
scale, shorter lead times and better chemistry (Badman and
Srai 2018). Manufacturing technology could help achieve
resilience and patient-centric manufacturing. However, mak-
ing a convincing business case for switching to, for exam-
ple, continuous processing remains a challenge (McWilliams
et al. 2018). We have addressed this topic more extensively
in forthcoming work (Srai et al. 2020).

Takeaway 2: How to map current dependencies. There
is lots of sensitivity about who supplies who in real-world
manufacturing networks. Getting specialised information is

1067

onerous, and often requires a bespoke ‘bottom-up’ network
mapping approach (Srai 2017). It may be quicker to proceed
‘top-down’ from freely available sector-level data.

Back to the cookies analogy, it is relatively easy to find
out what goes into a£1 worth of total industry output — say
‘baked products’. Obviously, there is something wrong in
approximating the whole industry with specific products
and businesses. However, national statistics offices world-
wide collect information about the former on a regular basis.
One such dataset is a ‘World Input—Output Table’ —WIOT
(Timmer et al. 2015). In Fig. 2 [use WIOT data to show the
foreign value-added share (FVAS) in the UK manufacturing
and digital economy (for the details, see Settanni and Srai
2018).

According to Fig. 2, the UK foreign value added is con-
tributed mainly by the EU (13.5% in 2013, with a slight
decline in 2014). Indeed, 21% worth of competitive imports
into the UK’s pharmaceutical sector originates in Germany
and only 3.5% in China in 2013. Within the UK manufac-
turing economy, pharmaceutical manufacturing exhibits
the lowest FVAS. This approach may be coarse, but gives a
first approximation of the breadth of value dependencies in
global manufacturing.

3 Matching demand and supply

Besides choosing a supply base wisely, picking up meaning-
ful ‘demand signals’ can be extremely tricky. Unanticipated
signals put manufacturing technologies to the test, challeng-
ing them to adapt and scale up in extreme operating condi-
tions. In the case of APIs, these issues exposed an unreliable
supply base. In the case of testing, they exposed the need to
support production as it struggled to catch up with demand.

Sector experts argue that over-reliance on China and India
for the manufacture of APIs was old news to them. So why
is it so difficult to make a convincing case for alternative
manufacturing network configurations?

Lesson 5: The scale and adaptability demanded by
extreme operational conditions may not be viable. Consider
a nuclear power plant. A safe design will factor in the odds
that an earthquake of a certain magnitude hits the area where
the plant is built. But when things do not pan out as antici-
pated, we regret not having gone the extra mile with safety
requirements (Silver 2013: Ch. 5).

Something similar is happening to manufacturing net-
works. Before COVID-19, sizing a manufacturing plant
according to the highest anticipated level of demand meant
freezing resources on idle capacity. After COVID-19,
peak demand is dictating manufacturing expansion plans.
For example, RNA extraction relies on a general-purpose
bioseparation technology based on magnetic beads (Sinclair
1998). Whilst the technology could easily be repurposed, the

scale of extraction kits required became evident as testing
for COVID-19 progressed (Lim and Ehley 2020). A lead-
ing diagnostic equipment provider is expanding production
of RNA extraction kits sevenfold (QIAGEN 2020). Regula-
tors are also granting emergency use approval for alternative
technologies that bypass RNA extraction. Yet, the diagnostic
precision of these technologies is debated (Winter 2020).
There is little concern about what is going to happen to the
excess capacity when the storm has passed.

Lesson 6: Pre-emptive action might not pay off. Epide-
miologists have warned that infectious diseases should be
treated like national security threats— as with other threats,
securing medical equipment, supplies, APIs and expertise
deserves long-term investment and public will (Osterholm
and Olshaker 2020).

This brings me back to an example in Silver (2013:
pp.206—208). In 1976, the Ford administration in the US
took resolute preventive action to secure $180 m worth

of vaccines ahead of a pandemic that failed to material-
ise. Adding insult to injury, a rushed vaccine develop-
ment program is believed to have caused neurological
complications. Taking action on the basis of initial trend
extrapolations may not pay off, and leaders can expect very
little credit for taking preventive action (Bazerman and
Watkins op. 2008). If successful, preventive action incurs
tangible costs, and makes the costs avoided impossible to
demonstrate.

Similar issues emerged whilst exploring drug repurpos-
ing in the absence of treatment for COVID-19. One of the
candidates, chloroquine, was an assumedly cheap staple
in the prevention of malaria (Principi and Esposito 2020).
Anticipating a surge in demand, the only US manufacturer
doubled its price (Kuchler 2020a). India, who manufactures
most of the API needed for these formulations, decided to
ban exports and prioritise internal use (Kuchler 2020b).
Treatment for pre-existing patients was suddenly put at

Fig. 3 Fictitious supply chain and inputs needed to work out safety stocks in the presence of uncertain demand

risk, without evidence that the drug is effective for its newly
intended use.

Takeaway 3: How demand signals propagate across a sup-
ply network structure. Probably we all have heard of safety
stocks. Put it simply, these are ‘buffers’ against demand vari-
ability during the time between placing an order and receiv-
ing it. One could think of it as the number of toilet paper
rolls on top of a household’s weekly need—yjust to avoid
running out of it between purchases. At the early stages of
COVID-19 outbreak, toilet paper was in shortages in most
stores. Based on the behaviour of some shoppers hoarding
this product, their safety stock estimate must have gone
through the roof.

On a serious note, thinking safety stocks is a really good
way to link an uncertain demand with the intricacies of a
manufacturing network. In Fig. 3 I’ve made up a fictitious
pharmaceutical supply network with some information about
each manufacturing location and the demand signal expe-
rienced closer to the market. Detail about how to answer
the questions highlighted in red in Fig. 3 are beyond scope
but the interested reader is referred to Graves and Willems
(2000).

For now, it may be interesting to note the similarities
between Fig. 3 and what most hospitals had to go through
whilst facing the arrival of COVID-19 patients. Figure 4
shows a simple schematic I prepared to make sense of a
possible strain on hospital resources due to different patient
arrival scenarios.

The bell-shaped curve on the left-hand side of Fig. 4 is
not the output of a fully-fledged epidemiological model. Yet,
it is often used in practice. Many applications of advanced

information technology and modelling aim to get that curve
right (Naudé 2020). Figures 3 and 4 suggest that supply net-
work analysis starts where those applications end.

4 Beyond ‘silver bullets’ and ‘bad apples’:
improving situational awareness

When times are hard, it 1s tempting to look for ‘silver bul-
lets’. Some promptly concluded that companies should rush
through very specific technological transformations (e.g.,
Morgan 2020). It is also a deeply rooted belief that unac-
ceptable outcomes must be due to morally wrong root causes
(Hollnagel 2018). The same goes for disruptions related to
COVID-19; hunts for “bad apples’ are often on (see e.g.
Smith 2020; Mehta 2020).

Especially in times like this, it is worth recalling that we
are not always in a position to claim than doing ‘a’ leads
to ‘b’. In this spirit, I have tried to highlight that decisions
about sourcing and manufacturing inherently expose supply
chains to disruption. Targeted technology adoption, reshor-
ing, and pre-emptive institutional action may have the charm
of silver bullets, but I doubt these initiatives guarantee that
we always get at our doorstep everything we need.

I find more intriguing that, despite the current abundance of
information, reading clues in a complex environment remains
difficult. We could look back at the events discussed above
through the theoretical lens of situational awareness (Endsley
1995). For a pilot in the cockpit of a fighter jet, situational
awareness is about perceiving relevant clues about a changing

and challenging environment. Surely, plenty of clues are con-
veyed by the instrumentation. But which ones to pick? And
what to make of it? Stitching together relevant clues, the pilot
forms an integrated picture of the current situation. This also
helps the pilot to make projections about future states.
Perhaps the dynamic reappraisal of location decisions in
global manufacturing networks is not dissimilar from piloting
a fighter jet. In both cases, the issue is how to convey relevant
clues while avoiding undue cognitive effort. Tackling this issue
can be tricky in the absence of what Cooley (2007) calls a
‘creative interaction between judgement and calculation’.
Back to the cookies joke with which we started, situational
awareness might help us figure out when to start swapping
recipes. But even then, we might have forgotten how to bake.
