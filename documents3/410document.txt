is available at the end of the tasks for autonomous vehicles to avoid vehicle-cyclist collision. In this paper, a robust

Introduction
Autonomous vehicle has attracted great interest in much ongoing research [1, 2], and
environment perception is an essential step toward the trajectory plan for autonomous
vehicle [3-5]. The perception task is usually divided into several sub-tasks, including
object detection and tracking, object localization and behavior prediction. In recent
years, cycling is gaining the popularity, and 43% growth is reported in Ireland between
2011 and 2016 [6]. Since there is no special protection equipment, cyclists are the vul-
nerable road users. Moving cyclist inevitably interacts with other traffic participants in
local environment, and vehicle-cyclist collision amounts to a large proportion of traffic
accidents every year [7]. Therefore, to enhance the cycling safety, much attention must
be paid to cyclist detection and tracking for autonomous vehicle system.

The existing cyclist detection methods using laser scanner are mostly conducted for
counting the number of the cyclists without the interference of non-cyclist road users

[8, 9]. Motivated by the analysis of the object detection studies, a novel method for
cyclist detection and tracking using multi-layer laser scanner is proposed in this paper.
IBEO LUX 4L is adopted as the main sensor and mounted on the front bumper of the
autonomous vehicle, as shown in Fig. 1. First, subarea-based DBSCAN method is devel-
oped to segment the point cloud clusters. Second, three categories of the feature sets
are employed with SVM and DT classifiers respectively, and six classifiers are obtained
totally. Then, MHT algorithm based on Kalman filter is used to track multiple detected
cyclists. It is validated that the proposed cyclist detection and tracking method has good
performance in real road scene. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) It is the
first attempt to separate the raw point cloud into several subareas based on the density
distribution; (2) CS model is selected as the motion model of the cyclist, and MHT algo-
rithm is used to track multiple cyclists.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. “Related works” describes
the point cloud clustering process. Section “Feature extraction” presents the feature
extraction. Section “Classification” introduces the cyclist classifiers. Section “Tracking”
presents the cyclist tracking algorithm. Experimental results are given in Sect “Experi-
ments”. Section “Conclusion” concludes this study.

Related works

In the field of cyclist detection and tracking, most state-of-the-art methods rely upon
machine vision sensors [10-12], due to the advantages of high-resolution image with
the color and texture information. Zangenehpour [10] presented the cyclist detec-
tion method based on histogram of oriented gradient feature for video datasets from
crowded traffic scenes. Li [11] described a unified framework for cyclist detection, which
included a novel detection proposal and a discriminative deep model based on Fast
R-CNN with over 50000 images. Tian [12] explored geometric constraint with various
camera setups and built cascaded detectors with multiple classifiers to detect cyclists
from multiple viewpoints. Bieshaar [13] used 3D convolutional neural network to detect
the motion of cyclists on image sequences with spatio-temporal features. Liu [14] uti-
lized a region proposal method based on aggregated channel feature to solve cyclist
detection problem for high-resolution images. However, cyclist detection and tracking
based on vision sensors still remain challenging, since the camera is susceptible to the
illumination and the large variability of cyclist exists in appearance, pose and occlusion.

Compared with vision sensors, laser scanner can collect the spatial and motion informa-
tion of the detected objects [15, 16]. As for the number of the laser layers, laser scan-
ners are divided into three types, namely, 2D, 2.5D and 3D. 2D laser scanner generates
the sparse single-layer point cloud which is inadequate for object classification in real
driving environment. 3D laser scanners are usually installed on the top of autonomous
vehicles and they can produce 3D dense point cloud to cover full-field of view for global
environment construction. However, the high cost of 3D laser scanners limits the wide
application. Compared with other kinds of laser scanners, 2.5D laser scanner, e.g., IBEO
LUX 4L, is a more practical option for object classification.

Extensive algorithms have been presented for object classification using 2.5D multi-
layer laser scanner [17-24]. Wang et al. [19] built SVM classifiers based on 120-dimen-
sional point cloud feature set for object recognition. Huang et al. [20] captured the
discontinuities of the point cloud with the distance threshold to segment the clusters,
and trained three categories of classifiers to recognize the dynamic obstacles in driv-
ing environment. Magnier et al. [21] employed belief theory to detect and track moving
objects using multi-layer laser scanner. Kim et al. [22] extracted the geometrical fea-
tures from four-layer point cloud data and detected the pedestrians with RBFAK clas-
sifier. Carballo et al. [23] used several intensity-based features for pedestrian detection.
Arras et al. [24] conducted pedestrian classification with 14 static features of human
legs at indoor environment. Compared with much research on the detection of other
road users, e.g., vehicle and pedestrian, the study on cyclist detection using laser scan-
ner is limited. Subirats et al. [8] employed single-layer laser scanner to monitor the road
surface and count the cyclists in real traffic flow, and the length of the detected cyclists
is subject to the speed of the cyclists. Prabhakar et al. [9] presented the last line check
method to detect and count the Powered Two Wheelers (PT Ws) with the laser scanner
at a fixed angle. In general, the existing study on cyclist detection using laser scanner is
mainly conducted for counting the number of the cyclists while ignoring the variation of
the cyclists’ motion state. In this paper, the proposed method for cyclist detection and
tracking using multi-layer laser scanner aims at capturing the moving cyclist with high

accuracy.

Point cloud clustering

The range of the scanned obstacles affects the density of the returned point cloud
directly. In real driving environment, the point cloud varies frame by frame, and the
number of the surrounding clusters is uncertain. DBSCAN clustering method is often
used to deal with the uneven point cloud, since there is no need for DBSCAN to set the
number of the clusters in advance, and the input parameters are the minimum number
of the laser points in the cluster and the neighbor radius [25].

It may happen that traditional DBSCAN method segments multiple obstacles at close
range as one cluster, while the single obstacle at long range is clustered as several clus-
ters. Therefore, subarea-based DBSCAN method is proposed in this paper. First, the
density distribution curve is generated for the uneven point cloud, and the subareas are
divided based on the characteristics of the density distribution. Then, the optimal neigh-
bor radius is calculated for each subarea, and DBSCAN method is applied to the point

cloud in each subarea. The point cloud data at one frame in campus environment is
Zhang et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:20 Page 4 of 18

taken as an example. First, the point cloud in the region of interest is divided into several
subareas along the motion direction of ego-vehicle installed with the laser scanner. Since
the excessive subareas may cause the increase of the computation cost and the fewer
number of the subareas may lead to some empty subareas, the number of the subareas
need to be selected properly. According to the statistical analysis, the relation between
the number of the subareas and the number of the points is given as follows:

m = 0.187 x (n—1)/? (1)

The ratio between the number of the points in each subarea and the number of
total points is defined as the density of each subarea. The density histogram is used to
describe the distribution of the point cloud. For the example frame, there are 424 points
in the interest region, and the number of the subareas equals 10.55 according to formula
(1). Thus, the number of the subareas is set as a round number 10. The density distribu-
tion curve is obtained based on the density histogram, as shown in Fig. 2. We can see
that the wave crest of the density distribution curve means the dense distribution, while
the wave valley corresponds to the sparse distribution. The wave valley of this curve is
the inflection point of the point cloud density variation, and it is also considered as the
partition point for subareas. Note that the valleys between any two wave crests is not
always the appropriate partition point, in case of the redundant operation. If the den-
sity difference between two adjacent subareas is not too large, there is no need to divide
these two subareas, and these subareas can be regarded as one subarea with uniform
density. Therefore, the density difference threshold of the subarea is set as a constant
value 7, and the subareas are divided only when the difference between two adjacent
wave peaks is greater than T. According to the attributes of the point cloud from LUX 4L
laser scanner, the density difference threshold T is set as 50. As shown in Fig. 2, the den-
sity differences among three adjacent peaks Xp,, Xp) and Xp; of the density distribution
curve are greater than the threshold T. Thus, the valleys X, and X, among these three
peaks are regarded as two partition points, and the partition locations are X, = 12 m and
X, = 20 m. Finally, three subareas with various densities are obtained, as shown in Fig. 3.

The original DBSCAN algorithm [25] and the proposed subarea-based DBSCAN algo-
rithm are used to cluster the point cloud at this example frame, respectively. Figure 4

shows the clustering results from these two DBSCAN algorithms, and each color of the
point cloud denotes an individual cluster. We can see that the subarea-based DBSCAN
algorithm separates two neighboring obstacles successfully while the original DBSCAN
algorithm clusters two neighboring obstacles into one obstacle using the global neighbor
radius. Thus, the subarea-based DBSCAN algorithm achieves better clustering perfor-
mance than the original DBSCAN algorithm.

Feature extraction

37-dimensional feature set is proposed for cyclist detection and tracking based on
the point cloud characteristics of the cyclist. This feature set includes 11 number-of-
points-based features, 16 geometric features and 10 statistical features, as listed in
Tables 1, 2 and 3. Feature 23 denotes the length of the polyline which connects the
horizontal projection points in ascending order of horizontal coordinate value. Fea-
tures 28-31 denote the convexity of the scan points at each layer, and the convexity
is equal to the distance between the center of the fitting circle and the origin point
minus the distance between the geometric center of all the scan points and the origin
point. Feature 37 denotes the residual ratio of the bounding areas for two edges of
the laser points vs. the middle points, and this feature indicates that the middle of the
point cloud cluster is denser than the edges.

The effectiveness of the feature set is significant to improve the performance of
classifier. However, the combination of multiple independent features cannot always
make better classification ability than single feature. Therefore, the optimization of
the feature set is necessary to reduce the redundancy among multiple features. Relief
algorithm [26] and PCA method [27] are employed in the optimization process.

Relief algorithm
Relief algorithm is a feature selection method based on the multi-variable filtering,
and it uses the sample learning to determine the weight of the features. Each feature

is evaluated by the classification performance difference between the same category

set F, the classification weight of each feature is calculated, and the weight propor-

PCA algorithm

PCA is a statistical method which can convert the series of features into new alterna-
tive feature components. This method can simplify the original features to ensure the
minimum loss of feature information. PCA is conducted for the normalized features
to generate the eigenvalue, as well as the variance and cumulative variance of each
principal component, as shown in Table 4. The cumulative variance of the first and
second principal components reaches 91.0%, thus the first and second principal com-
ponents are regarded as new feature indexes: Fp =[Fp,, Foy].

Classification

SVM classifier

With the strong generalization capability, SVM is utilized as an independent classifier.
First, the normalization is conducted as follows:

—1l, f < fmin
scale(f) = « —1 +E Lmio)  frnin <f <fmax (2)
1, f > fimax

where f is the normalized eigenvalue, f,,,, and f,.;, are the maximum and minimum
eigenvalues, respectively. Since Radial Basis Function (RBF) can achieve nonlinear map-

ping with a few parameters, RBF is selected as the kernel function:

K (x,y) = exp(—y||x — y|| >) (3)

where the parameter y and penalty factor C are traversed by the grid optimization and
cross validation using LIBSVM toolbox [28]. In our test, the optimal parameters are:
c= 2068, y=0.006821.

DT classifier

Since the features are discrete variables, ID3 algorithm is selected as DT classifier.
The main scheme of DT classifier is as follows. The feature with the largest infor-
mation gain is selected as the classification benchmark. The classification process is
repeated until a decision tree with the complete classification ability is constructed.
The entropy of random variable x is:

n
H(X) =-)S pix log pj (4)
i-1
The entropy of each attribute of the dataset D is:

N
H(Dj) =—)_ pi x logy pi (5)
i-1

where p; represents the ratio of the number of samples for the ith-dimensional feature
and the number of total features, and 1 represents the number of total features. For the

given feature F,, the conditional entropy of the dataset D is:

where |D,| represents the number of features for the ith subset, and |D| represents the
number of all samples in the dataset D. On the basis of the entropy H (Dj) and the con-
ditional entropy H(D|F; ) of the feature F,, the information gain of the feature F, is calcu-
lated by:

g(D, Fi) = H(D) — H(DIF;) (7)

Tracking

Object tracking can predict the future motion state and avoid the missing detection caused
by temporary occlusion. Moving object tracking consists of data association and motion
estimation. The data association procedure associates the same objects in successive
frames, and the motion estimation procedure uses the filter method to estimate the posi-
tion and speed of the associated objects. In this section, MHT algorithm is combined with

Kalman filter algorithm to track the cyclist based on the CS model.

Data association

MHT algorithm selects the optimal association hypothesis for the same object at two con-
secutive frames. And the calculation of hypothesis probability is critical. From the tracking
start time to the kth time step, all the measurements are recorded as Z*={Z(1), Z(2),...,
Z(k)} and all the hypothesis sets obtained by MHT algorithm at kth time step are recorded
as Qk = { Qk ,i=1,2,...,K \ The hypothesis probability pk is calculated at the Ath time

step by the hypothesis Qk as follows:
pk = p((2k1Z"}) (8)

Assumed that Qk is obtained by the correlation hypothesis ¢, between the hypothesis
Qk ~1 at previous frame and the measurements Z(k) at the current frame. Bayes theorem is
utilized to compute the hypothesis probability:

p(2',91Z) = =p(2) 12 ex) « p(vel@k) x p( 2k) (9)

where c is the normalized constant. In terms of the association hypothesis ¢,, the num-
ber of the measurements associated with the new object at the current frame is marked
as Ny, (4), the number of the measurements associated with the false object is set as Ne,
(i), the number of the measurements associated with the previous object is labeled as
Npr (A), and the number of all the object is M,. Assumed that the number of the exist-
ing detected object obeys binomial distribution, the number of new objects is subject to
Poisson distribution, and the number of false objects also obeys Poisson distribution, we

can obtain:

NTGT

P(Nor, Net, Nnr | Qk) = (

where Pp is the detection probability, B;-7 is the probability density of the false alarm, By,
is the probability density of the new objects, F,, (A) is the Poisson distribution with the
rate parameter 1. Then we get:

(12)

After the probability of each possible association hypothesis is obtained, all the
association probabilities are represented by one correlation matrix. The hypothesis H
with the maximum association probability is selected as the optimal hypothesis.

Motion model

The motion state of the object is usually described by several common models, includ-
ing constant velocity model, constant acceleration model and CS model. The motion
state of the cyclist varies frame by frame, and sudden acceleration or deceleration may
happen at any time. To avoid the large cumulative error, CS model is used to estimate
the motion state of the cyclist. CS model is time-correlated, and the mean value is the
estimation of acceleration at the current time step, and the probability distribution of
the acceleration is represented by the revised Rayleigh distribution [29]. In CS model,

the acceleration model of the cyclist is as follows:

x(t) = a(t) + a(t) (13)

a(t) = —aa(t) + w(t) (14)

where a is the mean value of acceleration, a is the reciprocal of the time constant, w(t)
is the white noise with the mean value 0, the variance o2 = 2ac7, a? is the acceleration

variance. Thus, CS model for the cyclist is established by:

x(t) 01 0 x(t) 0 0
x(t); =|00 1 x(t) | + | 0} a(t) + | O} wi) (15)
% (t) 00 —a | | Xz) oH 1

Filtering algorithm
The state variable of the cyclist is:

x(t) = [x(t), «(t), #10, (0), 10), WO]

and the state equation is as follows:

The above formula can also be provided by:

where x(t), x(t), x(t), y(t), y(t), y(t) represent the position, speed and acceleration of
the cyclist along X and Y directions, respectively.a,, dy represent the average accelera-
tion along X and Y directions. w,(t), w,(t) denote the zero-mean white noise in X and Y

The cyclist motion system is modeled based on Kalman filter and CS model as follows:

P(k|k — 1) = b(k|k — 1)P(k — 1k — 1) $7 (k|k — 1) + QK - 1) (20)

Experiments
Datasets

The independent clusters of the point cloud samples are segmented by subarea-based
DBSCAN algorithm at each frame. In the experiments, the camera synchronously col-
lected the scene image to manually mark the positive and negative point cloud samples
of the cyclists. Figure 7 shows the real scene at one frame and the classification result
in the point cloud scene. In this figure, each color of the point cloud denotes each scan
layer of the laser scanner. The red and black rectangles denote the cyclist and non-
cyclist, respectively. The positive samples include the cyclists with various poses, and the

negative samples include pedestrians, vehicles, lamp posts, trees and other non-cyclist

Detection algorithm validation

To demonstrate the performance of multiple classifiers for cyclist detection, six
classifiers are constructed: (1) SVM+F, (2) SVM+Fp, (3) SVM+Fp, (4) DT +F, (5)
DT+F,) and (6) DIT +Fp. ROC curve is used to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, as shown in Fig. 9. AUC (area under the ROC) is the critical parameter to
measure the cyclist detection performance. The classifier with larger AUC is superior
to other classifiers. Table 5 lists the results of each classifier. It indicates that SVM
classifier outperforms DT classifier with the same feature set for cyclist detection.
For SVM classifier, the features extracted by PCA method show the best recognition
result than other feature sets, while the features from Relief algorithm performs the
best for DT classifier. In terms of the same classifier, the classification performance
of the original 37-dimensional feature set is the worst. It means that the redundancy
exists among the original feature set, and the proposed feature selection methods are
essential. In general, AUC values of six classifiers exceed 0.93, and it demonstrates

that each classifier show good performance for cyclist detection.

Tracking algorithm validation

To evaluate the proposed cyclist tracking algorithm, the point cloud of moving cyclist
in campus is collected using LUX 4L on the stationary vehicle. As shown in Fig. 10,
three cyclists moves away frame by frame. We set detection probability P,;=0.9, and
the probability that the correct measurement falls into the tracking gate P,=0.99.

The tracking results for Frame 80, Frame 160, Frame 240 are shown in Fig. 10. The
black rectangle denotes the detected cyclist, and the speed is explicitly labelled in kil-
ometers per hour. The tails dragged by three cyclists are the historical tracks. It indi-
cates that the combination of MHT algorithm with Kalman filter based on CS model
can accurately track multiple cyclists.

To further verify the motion estimation performance of the proposed tracking
method, the estimated motion parameters of Cyclist 2 are compared with on-board
GPS data. The lateral and longitudinal positions in the tracking process are shown in
Fig. 11, and the velocities along the lateral and longitudinal directions are shown in
Fig. 12. The point cloud of the cyclist varies with the range frame by frame, and the
variation causes the instability of the cyclist center. The measured position and speed
of the cyclist even fluctuate obviously, and it does not match the real motion of the
cyclist. The stable position and speed of moving cyclists are obtained from the pro-
posed Kalman filter method based on CS model. Thus, the proposed tracking method
has a good applicability.

Conclusion

In this paper, cyclist detection and tracking method is presented based on multi-layer
laser scanner. Firstly, subarea-based DBSCAN algorithm is developed to segment the
uneven point cloud based on the density distribution. Secondly, considering the point
cloud characteristics of the cyclists, we construct 37-dimensional feature set includ-
ing number-of-points, geometric and statistical features. Relief algorithm and PCA are
further used to optimize the feature set, respectively. Then, three feature sets are com-
bined with SVM and DT classifiers to generate six categories of cyclist classifiers, and
the detected cyclists are tracked using MHT algorithm and Kalman filter based on CS
motion model. Experimental results show that the subarea-based clustering algorithm
can effectively segment the laser points into independent clusters. For SVM classifier,
the feature set extracted by PCA method brings the better classification result than
other feature sets, while the feature set from relief algorithm performs the best for DT
classifier. The proposed cyclist tracking method can obtain the position and speed of
moving cyclists robustly. Because of the sparsity of the laser points, future work will be

the utilization of various sensors to achieve accurate detection and tracking for the long-

range cyclist.
