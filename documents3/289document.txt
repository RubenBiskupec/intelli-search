Multifunctional hydrogel systems

Hydrogels possess exceptional physical and chemical properties that render them appealing components
for soft actuators, wearable technologies, healthcare devices, and human interactive robots. Especially,
the stimuli-responsive hydrogels can sense and perform smart functions in the presence of various
stimuli that collectively contribute to the intelligence of the soft machine systems. Furthermore, facile
modification of hydrogels with other functional groups/additives/nanofillers substantially expands their
functionalities and further broadens the scope of their application. Designing suitable hydrogels with
adequate capabilities and engineering effective configurations are of supreme importance for the
development of advanced hydrogel-based soft machines. Herein, this review summarizes recent ad-
vances of stimuli-responsive hydrogels in multifunctional soft machines, such as robotics, actuators, and
sensors. Functions including multistimuli responsiveness, self-healing, and high biocompatibility can be
endowed to the soft machines through designing advanced hydrogel materials, which would not be
possible with an approach based on conventional elastic materials (e.g. rubbers, elastomers). To close,
future opportunities and challenges this field faces are emphasized and discussed for the development of

exciting new hydrogel-based devices in real-world conditions.

1. Introduction

Hydrogels are water-swollen polymer networks whose struc-
ture and material properties depend sensitively on intermolecular
interactions [1]. These versatile materials are technologically
promising because hydrogels exhibit high mechanical compliance
comparable to biological tissues, have high permeability to various
molecules, high ionic conductivity, and excellent biocompatibility
[2,3]. Biological hydrogels in animals and plants can dynamically
adapt these properties in response to external stimuli, enabling
mechanical actuation, chemical sensing and release, self-healing,
etc [4]. In comparison, artificial hydrogels have historically been
static materials that are mechanically fragile, which has limited
their application as engineering materials [5]. There is emerging
interest in designing artificial hydrogels as ‘soft machines’ that can

transduce external stimuli into a programmable function,
mimicking dynamic biological behaviors [3]. For example, hydro-
gels can undergo volumetric changes such as swelling or shrinking
in response to physicochemical triggers such as pressure [6], elec-
trical/magnetic fields [7,8], temperature [9], and light [10]; chemi-
cal or biochemical stimuli involve salt gradients [11], pH values
[12], redox reactions [13], organic solvents [14], and biomolecules
[15]. These mechanisms are highly relevant for the implementation
of soft actuators [16—18], sensors [19-21], and robots [19,22,23],
which could transform consumer electronics [24—26], wearable
technologies [27—29], healthcare and human assistance devices
[19,30,31].

Most existing soft and hard machines are typically comprised of
different parts that are mechanically coupled or electrically wired
together. Indeed, soft machines are assembled mostly by rigid
supporting backbones and non-stretchable structural components
(e.g. magnets, metal bearings, external circuits) as well as soft,
deformable joints or coating [32,33]. These parts typically permit
complementary functions: rigid components enable fast, strong,
and precise output forces and movement [23], while soft parts
endow machines with elastic capabilities that permit adaptive and

dexterous interactions with objects/users [34—36]. These inte-
grated systems with rigid and soft parts are capable of conducting
various intended functions, such as sensing, processing, and
transducing external physicochemical signals. Thus, the response of
this assembly typically requires complicated feedback loops that
Manage communication between these macroscopic parts. The
feedback loops and functional modules would inevitably increase
the structural complexity and energy consumption, while slowing
response time [33].

In principle, hydrogels can realize stimuli-responsiveness and
integrate multiple functions together at small scales by designing
polymeric building blocks with distinct chemical moieties. Within
an aqueous environment, hydrogels are formed from polymers that
are physically entangled, covalently or ionically cross-linked [1].
Polymers can further interact through electrostatic interactions,
hydrogen bonding, as well as van der Waals forces. In thermody-
namic equilibrium, the hydrogel architecture is thus governed by
some competition of polymer-solvent interactions, polymer elas-
ticity, polyelectrolyte-counterion interactions, etc [37]. External
stimuli can perturb these intermolecular interactions, resulting in
localized conformational changes that drive macroscopic shrinking
or swelling [38]. For example, next-generation hydrogels can be
molecularly engineered by block tailoring [39,40], cross-linker
adjustment [41,42], functional nanofiller/additive integration [43].
In particular, ionic interactions can synergize with covalent cross-
linking for high toughness [44], antifatigue [45], and self-healing
[46]. Such integration of sensing and actuation within a soft ma-
chine could enable fast response time, low energy consumption at
low cost. Beyond molecular-scale engineering, it remains chal-
lenging to pattern and print hydrogels into macroscopic shapes that
are relevant for soft devices, particularly robots that require high
adaptability, multistimuli responsiveness, and high dexterity
especially for complex motions/tasks. Indeed, interfacing hydrogels
with other materials remains a challenging task, including tough
adhesion of hydrogel coatings onto manifold tools/devices [47] and
creating asymmetric/anisotropic hydrogel (nano)composites [48].

Stimuli-responsive soft materials have attracted tremendous
research interests and achieved breakthrough in various fields.
Several previous review articles have reviewed a wide range of soft
materials, such as shape memory polymers, dielectric elastomers,
liquid crystals, and provided in-depth discussions regarding the
design principles of structural configurations that enabled complex
shape transformations [49—55]. Several advanced manufacturing
techniques have been adopted to enable precise shape-morphing
configuration of various soft materials [56—58]. Compared to
several important reviews that included case-to-case discussions
regarding the actuation mechanisms, we summarize various actu-
ating mechanisms in response to specific external stimuli (e.g.
temperature, light) and provide systematic comparisons. The
emerging hydrogel-based soft machines with built-in multi-
functionality have broadened the applications of  stimuli-
responsive hydrogels over the biochemical/biomedical applica-
tions (such as tissue engineering, artificial muscles, and drug de-
livery [49,59—65]) as well as demonstrated great potential to
replace or complement of some rigid materials in conventional
robots/machines [3,34—36]. Hence, there remained an urgent need
for a review article to reflect the most recent advances of hydrogel-
based smart robots and machines and foresee opportunities in the
future development for better-controlled hydrogel architectures
across multiple scales.

In this review, we focus on recent innovations for stimuli-
responsive hydrogel-based machines, including soft robots, actua-
tors, and sensors, which possess great potentials in myriad appli-
cations for remote actuation, underwater locomotion, and
ultrasensitive detection (Fig. 1). This review is aimed to deliver a

well-organized introduction of the cutting-edge development of
soft hydrogel-based machines to encourage and inspire future
innovative research in this field. First, we will summarize the
working mechanisms of designed hydrogels in response to various
physical and chemical stimuli. Then, we will explore the state-of-
the-art paradigms of soft hydrogel-based devices (e.g. robots, ac-
tuators, sensors) and elucidate the unique merits of these specific
hydrogels for the promising performances accordingly. Moreover,
several engineering approaches will be discussed toward the
development of soft hydrogel-based actuators/robots with multi-
functionality. Finally, we will highlight the current challenges for
soft hydrogel-based machines and provide our perspectives to
inspire future directions.

2. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels

Over the last several decades, hydrogels have been developed
that exhibit responsiveness to various stimuli, which result in
macroscale deformations/actuations [69,70], optical readout
[71,72], and electrical outputs [73,74]. The stimuli-responsive
hydrogels can be regarded as smart materials, and their physi-
ochemical properties are managed to be spontaneously adapted to
the varying environments. Such hydrogel-based smart materials
provide new design opportunities for the applications of soft ma-
chine systems (e.g. soft actuators and soft robots), where their
actuating behaviors can be commanded by various external stimuli,
including electrical current/voltage [66,75], heat (temperature)
[76,77], light [78,79], magnetic fields [80,81], pH value [82,83], and
salinity [84,85] (Fig. 2). In this section, we categorize various
hydrogel-based stimuli-responsive materials into six groups, based
on the kind of external stimulus required for on-demand actua-
tions. The corresponding stimuli-responsive mechanisms as well as
the resulting hydrogel actuations are also discussed as follows.
Their actuation rate and structures are compared in Table 1, based
on the hydrogel actuators with cantilever or similar structures.

2.1. Electroresponsive hydrogels

Electroresponsive hydrogels refer to a group of electroactive
polymers (EAP) that swell or de-swell in response to the electrical
signals applied (e.g. voltage, current) [86]. For example, when a
voltage is applied across a layer of electroresponsive hydrogel, the
electrical fields result in non-uniform ion distribution, which cau-
ses the osmotic pressure difference that results in the curvature
changes of the hydrogel layer (Fig. 2a). In general, the electro-
responsiveness of hydrogels can be specifically designed using the
EAPs with different ionizable functional groups. Several reported
EAPs are poly (2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)
(PAMPS) [87,88], poly (acrylic acid) (PAAc) [89,90], poly (4-
hydroxybutyl acrylate) (poly (4-HBA)) [91,92]. The ionizable func-
tional groups on the EAP backbones/side chains provide abundant
fixed charges that enable fast ion localization in response to the
electric fields, normally resulting in a short response time (ca. 0.1 s)
and large mechanical deformations (~40% in strain) of EAP-based
hydrogels [93]. Besides selecting different EAP backbones,
another approach is to add ionic compounds to enhance the elec-
troresponsiveness of hydrogels. By adding the ionic compounds
(such as lithium chloride (LiCl) [43,94] and sodium chloride (NaCl)
[95]) in hydrogel matrix, the concentration of mobile ions in-
creases, which thus induces faster hydrogel actuations in response
to the electrical fields. The fast and large volume change of elec-
troresponsive hydrogel is similar to natural muscles, which can be
utilized as biosensors [96] and artificial muscles [97] when
employing an electrical stimulus.

2.2. Thermoresponsive hydrogels

Thermoresponsive hydrogels are the most studied smart ma-
terials that can undergo dramatic and reversible volume changes as
the surrounding temperature varies. The working temperatures of
thermoresponsive hydrogels are based on the phase transition
behaviors of thermosensitive polymers [62]. For the thermores-
ponsive hydrogels with negative (inverse) thermosensitivity, the
hydrogels exhibit aqueous insolubility at the surrounding temper-
ature above their lower critical solution temperature (LCST), where
aggregation of desolvated polymer chains occurs, defined as LCST
behavior [9]. For example, poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNI-
PAAm) is a representative thermosensitive polymer that forms the
hydrogel with negative responses. When the surrounding tem-
perature is above its LCST (~32 °C), the PNIPAAm polymer chains
shrink due to the decreased water solubility (Fig. 2b) [98]. On the
other hand, polyacrylamide (PAAm) [99,100] and polyacrylic acid
(PAAc) [101,102] are the typical polymer backbones of responsive
hydrogels with positive thermosensitivity. As the surrounding
temperature is above the upper critical solution temperature
(UCST), the strength of water—polymer interactions, in terms of
hydrogen bonds or electrostatic bonds, become stronger than that
of polymer—polymer interactions [103,104]. The corresponding
increase of hydrogel solubility is defined as UCST behavior.

Moreover, by combining two types of thermosensitive poly-
mers, for example the copolymers of sulfobetaine methacrylate
(SBMA) and NIPAAm, the resulting hydrogels are managed to
possess dual responsiveness to the varying temperatures above the
UCST (15 °C) and lower than the LCST (41 °C) [105]. Oflate, there is a
growing interest in finetuning of the thermal responsiveness
through molecular design, which provides new opportunities to
develop various soft machine systems (actuators [106], robots
[107], sensors [108], drug delivery systems [109]) to fulfill different
applications requirements.

2.3. Photoresponsive hydrogels

Light is a particularly useful stimulus to remotely induce
the volume changes of photoresponsive hydrogels upon light
irradiation. Two main actuation mechanisms of photo-
responsive hydrogels include reversible cross-linking reaction
and photothermal excitation. Both of them can be realized by
the incorporation of photoactive moieties within the hydrogel

matrix [10]. For the mechanism of reversible cross-linking,
photoisomerization and photocleavage are two prevalent ap-
proaches. Upon light irradiation, photo-initiative moieties,
such as azobenzene (trans—cis configuration changes) [110]
and spiropyrans (ring opening/closing reactions) [111], can
induce the photoisomerization within hydrogel matrices. On
the other hand, photolabile protective groups (e.g. p-hydrox-
yphenacyl groups, o-nitrobenzyl groups [112], and triphenyl
methane groups [113]) are incorporated to achieve the pho-
tocleavage of hydrogels upon illumination. Sequential steps of
light-induced cross-linking followed by de-crosslinking pro-
cesses resulted in reversible contraction—expansion of polymer
chains [114]. Several applications have benefited from the
development of photoresponsive hydrogels, for example, self-
healing hydrogels, soft actuators or robots with remote con-
trol [46], molecular machines [115] and controlled drug release
[116].

In addition to the photo-induced cross-linking reactions, light-
induced deformation can be achieved by the _ reversible
dehydration—hydration processes. The reversible
dehydration—hydration processes are induced by using selective
illumination for localized heating. By incorporation of photo-
thermal nanomaterials, the dehydration—hydration processes can
be accelerated and intensified. The incorporated photothermal
nanomaterials can rapidly convert light irradiation to heat dissi-
pation, which induce the localized dehydration and thus the
deformation of photoresponsive hydrogels (Fig. 2c). Over the last
two decades, many nanomaterials with efficient photothermal ca-
pabilities, including inorganic nanomaterials (e.g. gold (Au)
[117,118], neodymium oxide (Nd203) [119], carbon-based materials
[120—123], black phosphorus [124]), and organic compounds (e.g.
cyanines [125], porphyrins [126]). have been incorporated into
hydrogels to improve the photoresponsiveness of resulting flexible
composites [127,128]. Compared with the reversible cross-linking
mechanism, the actuation speed based on photothermal excitation
is much faster (~10 times faster in angular speed) [127,129], which
is preferentially used in soft robots [127], and microfluidic devices
[130].

2.4. Magnetically responsive hydrogels

Magnetic field is a favorable stimulus for specific applications,
because it can trigger remote actuation with a fast response time

and still remain biocompatible even at high field strengths. The
magnetic responsiveness of hydrogels is mainly achieved by the
incorporation of external paramagnetic or ferromagnetic additives
into polymeric matrix, which enables rapid and large actuating
behaviors in response to magnetic fields. In such magnetically
responsive hydrogels, the magnetic additives are classified into
three main types: (1) metals and alloys (e.g. iron (Fe) [131], iron-
—platinum nanoparticle (FePt) [132], neodymium alloy (NdFeB)
[133]); (2) metal oxides (e.g. ferric oxide (Fe203) [134], ferrous ferric
oxide (Fe304) [135]); and (3) their functionalized derivatives. The
first two types of magnetic additives can be incorporated in the
hydrogel networks via physical entrapping. Subject to a non-uni-
form magnetic field, the magnetic additives engaged in the
hydrogel matrix serve as the magnetic drivers that can experience a
force proportional to the gradient of the applied field, which results
in the motion of magnetic additives either forward or backward
along the magnetic gradient. The motion of magnetic additives
drives the deformation of the hydrogel structure via the entangled

polymer chains [136,137]. The third type of magnetic additives is
generally prepared by the surface functionalization of magnetic
nanoparticles, which can serve as both magnetic drivers and
interparticle binders [138,139]. Another mechanism of magneti-
cally responsive actuation is through electromagnetic induction
heating. By experiencing a rapidly alternating magnetic field
(>10 kHz), heat can be generated by eddy currents in the ther-
moresponsive hydrogels incorporated with magnetic additives
[140—142]. One of the major features of induction heating is the
rapid response time of ca. 10~? s, rendering the applications of such
magnetically responsive hydrogels in soft robots [143,144], bio-
medicines [136,145], and microfluidic systems.

2.5. pH-responsive hydrogels

pH regulation is particularly convenient for aqueous solution
environments so that many studies of pH-responsive hydrogel
focus on the applications related to the human body, such as drug

delivery [146,147], gene delivery, and biochemical sensing [148].
The actuating behaviors of pH-responsive hydrogels rely on the
difference of osmotic pressure across the hydrogel networks upon
exposure of pH variation. The pH-responsive hydrogels are usually
fabricated by the polyelectrolytes that contain weak acidic or basic
function groups. These ionizable groups can serve as the ionic
barriers that only permit the ions with opposite charges to pass
through [149]. The directional ion localization leads to the osmotic
pressure within the hydrogel matrix and induces the responsive
deformation.

Based on the types of charges in the pendant groups of polymer
networks, the pH-responsive hydrogels are classified into acidic or
basic hydrogels. Common acidic hydrogels involve the polymer
networks with pendant acidic groups such as carboxylic groups
(e.g. PAAc [150] and poly (methacrylic acid) (PMAAc) [151]), sul-
fonic acid groups (e.g. PAMPS) [152], phosphonic acid groups (e.g.
poly (vinylphosphonic acid (PVPA) [153]), or boronic acid groups
(e.g. poly (vinylphenyl boronic acid) (PVPBA) [154]). The basic
hydrogels are usually composed of the polymers with pendant
basic groups such as amine or amide groups (e.g. PAAm [155], poly
(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) [156], poly (dia-
llyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) [157]). The acidic or
basic pendant groups undergo ionization with a dissociation con-
stant (K, for acidic pendant groups or Ky for basic pendant groups)
which either accepts or releases protons in response to changes in
environmental pH. For the acidic hydrogels, when the surrounding
PH value is higher than the pK,, the acidic pendant groups become
more negatively charged by releasing protons. As a result, there is
an increase in the hydrophilic nature of the hydrogels and elec-
trostatic repulsion between the polymer chains, leading to swelling
of the hydrogel networks and vice versa (pH < pK,) (Fig. 2e). In
contrast, basic pendant groups in basic hydrogels become more
positively charged by accepting protons at pH lower than the pKp
value. This process results in the improved hydrophilicity of the
polymer networks and increased electrostatic repulsion between
the polymer chains, inducing the volumetric expansion of the
hydrogel and vice versa (pH > pKy) [12,158—161]. Another classi-
fication is the amphoteric hydrogels that contains both acidic and
basic monomers (e.g. PMAAc-co-PDMAEMA), which swell at pH < 3
and at pH > 5, and shrink at pH 3—5, reversibly [162]. Many pH-

responsive hydrogels have been applied in various healthcare de-
vices, such as soft microrobots [146] and smart capsule switches
[147].

2.6. Salt-responsive hydrogels

Salt-responsive hydrogels swell and shrink when the salinity of
tested solution varies, which is preferable for underwater applica-
tions. Many pH-responsive hydrogels are also salt-responsive,
where the polyelectrolyte networks expand in pure water and
shrink in salt solutions, attributed to the changes of osmotic pres-
sure within hydrogel matrix. As the salt-responsive hydrogels are
placed in low-salinity solutions, the dissociation of ionizable groups
in aqueous solutions results in high charge density on the poly-
meric backbones and thus the intermolecular repulsion within
hydrogel matrix; the volumetric expansion of hydrogel is observed.
When the salt concentration increases, the charges of polymeric
backbones are screened by the added counter ions, so the inter-
molecular repulsion force is attenuated, resulting in the collapsed
polymeric network (Fig. 2f) [163]. Particularly, a group of salt-
responsive hydrogel is composed of the zwitterionic polymers,
for instance poly (carboxybetaine) [164] and poly (SBMA) [165].
Zwitterionic polymers are a class of neutral polymers with both
cationic and anionic groups on the same monomer unit. The
hydrogel with zwitterionic groups exhibits strong ‘anti-poly-
electrolyte’ effect that exhibits lower solubility in pure water than
in salt solutions. The reduced solubility in pure water is due to the
strong electrostatic interactions between the zwitterionic chains
(charge—charge, charge—dipole, dipole—dipole interactions). In salt
solutions, the increment of salt improves the solubility by screening
inter- and intra-chain attraction between the oppositely charged
groups, inducing the volumetric expansion [166]. The salt respon-
siveness of zwitterionic polymers can be tuned by incorporating
different types and concentrations of salts [167]. Additionally,
zwitterionic polymers demonstrate encouraging biocompatibility
and antifouling capability, rendering various on/off switching ap-
plications in soft biomedical and bioengineering devices, such as
biosensors [168,169] and immunoassay systems [170,171]. Some
salt-responsive hydrogel actuators are composed of bilayer struc-
tures with a polyelectrolyte layer and a polyzwitterionic layer. The
6 M. Ding et al. / Materials Today Advances 8 (2020) 100088

opposite responsive behaviors of polyelectrolytes and zwitterionic
polymers in pure water and Salt solutions can be utilized to regulate
the bidirectional bending [85,172].

2.7. Other stimuli-responsive hydrogels

Excepting the stimulation sources as mentioned above, other
types of physical or chemical stimuli, such as humidity [173], redox
states [75], organic solvents [174], chemical reagents [175], and
biomolecules [176] have been utilized to trigger the volumetric
variation of resulting hydrogels. The rational design of polymer
networks enables reversible and controllable shape _trans-
formation. Several examples are given as follows. For instance, a
humidity-responsive hydrogel is prepared by poly (ethylene glycol)
diacrylate (PEG-DA), where both hydrogen bonds and borate ester
bonds can be reversibly formed with water molecules. The PEG-DA
hydrogel is then fabricated into a humidity-driven walking robot
with a walking velocity of 3 mm/min” [177]. A redox-responsive
hydrogel containing 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) peptide
has been investigated for the applications of soft actuators. DOPA
can easily be oxidized to dopaquinone and reduced back by
chemical redox or electrochemical methods. The oxidation gener-
ated extra charges that further resulted in an influx of counter ions
to balance these charges, resulting in hydrogel swelling due to
osmotic pressure. In contrast, the reduction triggered a decrease in
electrostatic repulsion and loss of equivalent counter ions that
caused bulk shrinkage. The DOPA-containing hydrogel actuator can
dramatically change its volume by over 50% [75].

3. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels for soft actuators and robots

Relying on their excellent compliance and fast response to
various stimuli, hydrogels have been widely adopted for the fabri-
cation of diverse soft actuators and robots, which can be pro-
grammably actuated by a wide range of external stimuli (Fig. 3),
including physical stimuli (such as hydraulic/pneumatic pressure,
electrical current, light, heat, and magnetic field), and chemical
stimuli (such as changes in salinity or pH value, and exposure to
organic solvent). Moreover, by engineering the configuration, the
stimuli-responsive hydrogels can obtain not only simple bending
and twisting [69,192—195], but also complex 3D shape trans-
formation in micro-/macro-scale [58,196—200]. In general, the non-
homogeneous deformation of hydrogels can be realized by inho-
mogeneous swelling/shrinking including: (1) inhomogeneous
stimuli (e.g. temperature/concentration gradient) applied to ho-
mogeneous hydrogel structures [79,201], (2) homogeneous stimuli
applied to inhomogeneous hydrogel structures (e.g. bilayer
[69,192,193,195], different gradients of swelling along lateral di-
mensions [196—198] or vertical dimensions [174]). In this section,
the actuating mechanisms of different soft hydrogel-based ma-
chines in response to external stimuli are first introduced, there-
after the approaches to controlling complex robotic motions are
discussed.

Double-network hydrogels are prepared by entangling two
distinct polymeric components with complementary physical
properties, which can serve as robust soft materials for the hy-
draulic/pneumatic _pressure-driven soft —_actuators/robots
[6,79,202]. For example, polyacrylamide (PAAm)-alginate hydro-
gels consist of two interpenetrating polymer networks with cova-
lent and ionic cross-links, resulting in high level of stretchability
(~2,000%) and toughness (fracture energy ~9000 J/m?). The PAAm-
alginate hydrogel with double network are suitable for the fabri-
cation of soft actuators powered by hydraulic and pneumatic forces,
because they exhibit excellent mechanical stability without sacri-
ficing compliance for gently handling soft biological samples. As

shown in Fig. 3a, Yuk et al. [6] demonstrated the fabrication of a soft
gripper based on PAAm-alginate hydrogel, which was actuated bya
hydraulic pump. The hydraulic-powered soft actuator exhibited a
short response time of <1 s and strong movements (>1 N) over
1000 cycles with well-preserved mechanical robustness of PAAm-
alginate hydrogels. Another advantage of using PAAm-alginate
hydrogel to fabricate a soft gripper is its high optical trans-
parency. The transparent hydrogel gripper was demonstrated to
gently catch a goldfish without any harm, providing effective
camouflage from being detected for underwater reconnaissance.
In comparison with silicone-based elastomers, a particularity of
hydrogels is their high tolerance of chemical modifications. For
instance, hydrogels generally possess high content of water that
enable high ionic conductivity by introducing salt ions into the
networks. The acquired ionic conductivity can be thus utilized asa
unique add-on characteristic for the fabrication of electric-driven
soft actuators. Li et al. [94] adopted dielectric elastomer and
PAAm hydrogel to fabricate the fins of a soft fish with onboard
power and control (Fig. 3b). The ionically conductive hydrogel was
obtained by introduced lithium chloride (LiCl) into the PAAm
hydrogel, which was then sandwiched between two dielectric
elastomers. And the encapsulated hydrogel served as an ionically
conductive electrode while the surrounding tap water acted as the
other electrode. When a voltage was applied on the encapsulated
hydrogel, positive and negative charges accumulated on either
side of dielectric elastomer, inducing Maxwell stress that deformed
the soft fin to a lower-curvature structure. The in-plane actuations
of the elastomer/hydrogel fins were then converted to the
complicated propulsion motions of a soft fish robot. As shown in
the live snapshots of the swimming fish (the left image of Fig. 3b),
the fish body and fins flapped between the actuated and the rest
states with a change in bending angles from 16.7° to 26.9°. This
flapping motion resulted in the forward propulsion (28 mm for-
ward after four full flapping cycles) as shown in the right images of
Fig. 3b. Moreover, with the onboard power and control systems, the
fish-like soft robot was untethered and showed exceptional
mobility with a fast swimming speed of 6.4 cm/s (i.e. 0.69 body
length per second). In addition, the hydrogel-based fish robot
exhibited high optical transparency, large temperature tolerance
(~0.4—74.2 °C), as well as long endurance (3 h per charge), prom-
ising its application in various harsh underwater environments.
Hydrogels are important candidates for realizing ‘soft
machines’ mimicking many biological systems, as_ their
expansion—contraction behaviors in response to external stimuli
are similar to the actuations of natural muscle fibrils. Sunlight is a
widely used stimulus to induce the reversible volumetric changes
of hydrogels, which can be utilized to provide the on-demand
control of soft hydrogel-based actuators. Examples of early pho-
tothermal responsive hydrogels were limited by sluggish actuation
rates or requirements for specific environments due to the prop-
erties and conditions of their photoisomerization/ionization pro-
cesses [203,204]. To further improve the light responsiveness of
hydrogels, photothermal active materials (e.g. gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs), graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) were
incorporated into the hydrogel matrix to achieve fast,
programmable, and complex shape transformation
[117,120—122,205,206]. Qian et al. [127] recently reported a
sunflower-inspired soft robot (SunBOT) as a versatile platform that
can be constructed by using a wide range of photoresponsive soft
materials, including hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs),
and azobenzene/spiropyran-based polymers. The stem-like Sun-
BOT pillar was fabricated either by introducing nano-
photoabsorbers (e.g. AuNPs or reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) into
the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [PNIPAAm] hydrogels or by
incorporating organic photoabsorbers (e.g. polyaniline (PANI)) into

the poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) [PDMAEMA] hydro-
gels. With broad-spectrum light harvesting and efficient light-to-
heat capabilities, these hydrogel-based SunBOTs detected the
incident light and were actuated toward the light sources due to
localized heating and asymmetric deformation. The photo-
responsive SunBOTs featured the artificial phototropism with
omnidirectional self-orienting capability. Attributed to their nearly
infinite degrees of freedom, the SunBOTs were able to be applied
in untethered, self-contained and self-sustained soft robots.

Light responsiveness of soft hydrogel-based actuators results
from the localized heating under light illumination, which induced
asymmetric structural deformations (e.g. curvature change). The
heat energy converted from light can serve as a stimulus to control
the actuating behaviors of soft hydrogel-based robots. Recently, Lin
et al. [106] have utilized both thermally responsive PNIPAAm,-PAAy
and thermally non-responsive PAMx-PAAy hydrogels as building
block units to fabricate symmetric/asymmetric thermoresponsive
tube (TRT/as-TRT) actuators. When the temperature was above its
lower critical solution temperature (LCST) (50 °C), the responsive
PNIPAAm,-PAAy hydrogel shrunk accordingly. When the tempera-
ture was below LCST, the responsive hydrogel started to swell. In

response to the temperature change of the water bath or the
injected fluid in its channels, the PNIPAAm,-PAAy TRT or as TRT
actuators exhibited considerable volume changes, leading to
diverse/reversible bending behaviors. Such ‘amphibious’ soft
hydrogel-based tubular actuators were able to work in both air and
underwater environments, which were further utilized to transport
cargo in air or capture/release objects underwater ( d).

The magnetic field is regarded as a programmable stimulus that
can be utilized to remotely control the actuating behaviors of
untethered soft robots on demand. Recently, Tang et al. [81] have
incorporated neodymium alloy (NdFeB) nanoparticles into a ther-
moresponsive PNIPAAm hydrogel to form a magnetically respon-
sive hydrogel, which was morphed into various complex shapes by
an alternating magnetic field (AMF) generated by a coil. When
placed in the AMF, the magnetically responsive hydrogels were
heated due to the Néel relaxation of magnetic moments [207]. The
heated magnetic nanoparticles subsequently stimulated the sur-
rounding thermosensitive PNIPAAm hydrogels, which led to the
shrinkage of the hydrogel matrix when the temperature reached
the LCST. On top of this, by stacking a magnetically responsive
hydrogel layer and an elastomer layer together, various 2D and 3D
8 M. Ding et al. / Materials Today Advances 8 (2020) 100088

shape-morphing structures were managed to be achieved and
driven remotely by AMF. For example, a magnetically responsive
hydrogel-based origami robot was further utilized to conduct
magnetic navigation and shape-morphing behaviors within a
tortuous tube (Fig. 3e), promising a variety of soft robotic applica-
tions in biomedical fields.

Chemical stimuli (e.g. changes in salinity or pH value, and
exposure to organic solvent) can also be utilized to tune the water
content, inducing the reversible expansion—contraction, and
further enabling programmable actuating behaviors when appro-
priate robotic configurations are designed. Recently, He et al. [190]
synthesized a salt-responsive zwitterionic copolymer (poly (3-(1-
(4-vinylbenzyl)-1H-imidazole-3-ium-3-yl)propane-1-sulfonate)
(PVBIPS)), which was further cross-linked with a non-responsive
copolymer (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM)) to fabricate a
bilayer hydrogel-based device. Attributing to the salt-responsive
swelling behaviors of the zwitter ionic-enriched layer, the bilayer
devices demonstrated complex and reversible 3D shape trans-
formations upon the exposure to salt solutions, due to the mis-
matched swelling/shrinkage behaviors between two _ hydrogel
layers. With the optimal configuration design, the soft hydrogel-
based actuator was bent from ca. —360°—266° upon transition
between exposures to 1.0 M NaCl solution and de-ionized (DI)
water. On top of this, delicate small-scale hydrogel patterns were
fabricated, which demonstrated programmable shape _trans-
formations due to the distinct bending behaviors of different
patterned stripes (Fig. 3f).

Ma et al. [82] have utilized a LEGO-inspired strategy to assemble
the pH-responsive host (RH) hydrogel units and the pH-non-
responsive host (NRH) hydrogel units to construct 3D shape-
morphing structures; both hydrogels were composed of the same
polymeric networks (acrylamide (AAm) cross-linked by N,N’-
methylenebisacrylamide (BIS)), while the RH hydrogels contain
rich carboxylic acids. The RH hydrogel exhibited fast pH respon-
siveness as the pH value rose from 3 to 7, where the swelling ratio of
RH hydrogel increased from approximately 7 to 22, while the
swelling ratio of NRH hydrogel stayed unchanged. As the pH value
decreased from 7 to 2 (Fig. 3g), the shrinkage of a RH hydrogel ring
resulted in the out-of-plane bending of NRH hydrogel strips. Such
shape transformation into a 3D tower was reversed as the pH value
changed from 2 back to 7. Moreover, the shape-morphing behaviors
of pH-responsive hydrogel-based structures were able to be well
predicted using the full 3D finite element analysis.

Hydrogels also exhibit large volumetric changes upon the
exposure to organic solvents, based on which soft actuators can be
designed by integrating with different soft materials with different
responsiveness upon various organic solvent stimuli. Hubbard et al.
[191] have reported a bilayer hydrogel/elastomer actuator, where
the glass fiber fabric served as a strong bonding interlayer. The
elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) swelled in organic sol-
vent but did not change much upon contact with salt solution,
while the polyampholyte (PA) hydrogel shrunk in the organic sol-
vent but swelled largely in salt solution. As shown in Fig. 3h, a
triple-state actuator was obtained based on the asymmetric
structure of this actuator. As the PDMS/PA bilayer composite was
exposed to salt solution, the PA hydrogel layer swelled while the
PDMS layer remained unchanged, leading to the bending actuation
to the PDMS side. When exposed to acetone, the PDMS layer
swelled while the PA hydrogel shrunk at the same time, resulting in
the abrupt curving to the PA side. These two bending actuations
were able to be reversed back to original states when the poly-
dimethylsiloxane/polyampholyte bilayer (PDMS/PA) device was
exposed to de-ionized (DI) water, attributing to their reversible
swelling/deswelling characteristics.

4. Hydrogels that convey various physical stimuli to electrical
signals

Sensation is a desired functionality of soft machines to detect
external stimuli. By converting the stimuli into recordable signals
(e.g. current, resistance, optical color), sensing capability allows the
soft robots to monitor the environmental changes and conduct
adaptive actuations [19]. Conventional sensors (such as metal-
oxide-semiconductor sensors) that consist of rigid materials and
non-stretchable circuits are difficult to be conformally integrated
into the soft bodies of hydrogel machines [22]. To address this
challenge, one promising approach is to develop the hydrogels with
built-in sensing capabilities that can be readily integrated as robotic
units into soft machine systems [210]. Herein, we review recently
reported hydrogels with built-in sensing capabilities and categorize
them based on their output signals, including (a) electrical signals
(e.g. Capacitance, resistance) and (b) optical indications (e.g. color
change, reflection peak shift). In this section, we first focus on
sensory hydrogels using electrical signals as the stimuli feedback,
while the optical indications will be discussed in next part.

As soft and compliant machine bodies, hydrogels are easily
deformed by various mechanical forces where electrically
conductive hydrogels are able to transform the mechanical de-
formations into real-time electrical outputs of resistance and
capacitance signals [3]. For resistance-type, the hydrogels experi-
ence large resistance changes (4R/Ro) upon deformations due to the
disturbance of percolative conductive pathways [211]. To finely
distinguish different deformations, high sensitivity and low noise-
to-signal ratio are crucial parameters and many reinforced mate-
rials such as conductive polymers (e.g. polyaniline (PANI) [212],
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS) [213]), liquid metals (e.g. gallium, indium, and tin
eutectic alloy (GalnSn) [214]), carbon nanomaterials (e.g. carbon
black [215], carbon nanotubes(CNTs) [216]), and conductive 2D
materials (e.g. graphene [217], titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx)
[218]) are integrated into hydrogels as sensing-enhanced soft
bodies. For instance, Zhang et al. incorporated 2D MxXene nano-
sheets into poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels to achieve the
strain sensing capabilities [67]. Attributed to the highly percolative
MxXene networks, the MXene-PVA hydrogel possessed high elec-
trical conductivity (~955 S/cm) and exhibited deformation-
dependent resistance profiles. Under compressive strain, the con-
tact between MXene nanosheets transformed from face-to-edge
interconnections into face-to-face interconnections, thus reducing
the gaps between MXene nanosheets in the hydrogel (Fig. 4a, i). The
anisotropic sensitivity enabled independent and precise sensing of
motion speeds and directions. For instance, when a ball ran on the
hydrogel surface, the increased speed would cause larger de-
formations underneath and increase the resistance accordingly. The
motion velocity was also able to be determined from the resistance
change profiles (Fig. 4a, ii). Moreover, the mechanical deformations
from speaking was able to be detected and identified by recog-
nizing the resistance changes (Fig. 4a, iii).

Another approach to detecting mechanical deformations is
through monitoring the capacitance changes of hydrogel sensors.
Different from the resistive-type hydrogel sensors that only exhibit
a single layer of active material, the capacitive-type hydrogel sen-
sors generally require a sandwich structure composed of two
conductive layers (e.g. conductive hydrogels) and a dielectric layer
(e.g. elastomer) in between (Fig. 4b, i). These two hydrogel layers
are connected to a capacitive meter by metallic wires. The capaci-
tive meter provides a testing power to the hydrogel films, leading to
the movement of mobile electrons in the metallic wires and mobile
ions in the hydrogels either towards or away from the metal wire/
hydrogel interfaces. The sandwich structure can be regarded as two

electrical double layer (EDL) capacitors in series with the elastomer
capacitor. Since the capacitance of the elastomer capacitor is much
smaller than that of EDL capacitors, the capacitance of the resulting
sensors is described as C = ¢A/4mkd, where « is the dielectric
constant of the dielectric layer, A is the effective area of the con-
ducting layers, k is the electrostatic constant, and d is the thickness
of the dielectric layer. If the capacitive device is pressed or
stretched, the shape changes of the dielectric layer cause the
capacitance changes (4C/Cg), which can be recorded by a capacitive
meter [24,219] (Fig. 4b, ii).

Compared with the resistive-type sensors, the capacitive
hydrogel sensors show more linear and stable sensing signals.
Taking pressure detection as an example, Lei et al. assembled two
amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC)/ polyacrylic acid (PAAc)/algi-
nate composite layers (as ionic conductive layers) and a poly-
ethylene film (as the dielectric layer) for the fabrication of a
capacitive sensor [208]. ACC nanoparticles were cross-linked with
PAAc and alginate with strong chelation with Ca?* to improve the
elasticity of resulting hydrogels. The hydrogel-based sensors
showed a real-time response towards an external pressure with a
sensitivity of 0.17 kPa”! and linear response up to 1 kPa (Fig. 4b, iii),
enabling stable detection of gentle deformations. Moreover, the
hydrogel-based capacitive sensors can serve as strain sensors as
well. Dai et al. designed a capacitive strain sensor using a hydrogel
composite of pectin, PAAc, and metal ions [220]. Incorporation of
pectin and metal ions was able to form hydrogen bonds and dual
metal-carboxylate coordination bonds within the PAAc polymeric

networks, which thus improve the stretchability and repeatability.
The strain sensors demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.232 kPa’! under
a low working range (0%—242%) and 0.09 kPa~! under a high
working range (242%—343%).

Besides the mechanical deformations, environmental changes,
such as with temperature, can trigger the changes of electrical
outputs as well. For instance, inspired by muscles, Ge et al. reported
a thermoresponsive hydrogel-based sensor composed of PVA,
polyaniline (PANI), and glycerol [209]. The resulting hydrogel
mimicked both the microstructures of human muscles and their
mechanotransduction mechanisms (Fig. 4c, i). In human muscles,
the axon hillock dendrites function as a tight junction to be altered
by external stimulation, and the synapse serves as the junction that
permits a neuron to pass signals to another neuron or the target
effector cell [221]. To mimic the long sheath-like layout of the
neuron for the fast signal-responding, Ge et al. designed the long
fiber-like constructions. In the hydrogel polymer matrix, PANI
nanofibers (Fig. 4c, ii) which possessed high thermal conductivity
served as ‘artificial axon’ to transmit physical stimuli, and the joints
of intertwining conductive nanofibers functioned as ‘artificial
synaptic terminals’ to process signals. As shown in Fig. 4c, iii, with
the increment of surrounding temperatures, the resistance of
conductive PANI nanofibers increased and then transmitted to the
computer terminal via the intertwining conductive networks. The
fabricated hydrogel sensor achieved high thermal sensitivity with a
negative temperature coefficient of resistance of —0.016 °C"! and
discernible temperature resolution of 2.7 °C, which was further

demonstrated as a precise ‘fever indicator’ to monitor the tem-
peratures of human's forehead.

5. Hydrogels that transfer chemical stimuli to optical
information

Other than electrical signals, some hydrogel sensors have
managed to convert the chemical stimuli (e.g. ions, molecules) into
optical information as the output indications for facile readout
purposes [159,225]. Relying on the delicate structures of the
sensing platforms, the volumetric changes of the hydrogel by
swelling/de-swelling processes can result in changing optical pa-
rameters upon contact with an analyte, such as reflected colors
[68], transmitted light beam profiles [223], and reflective spec-
trums [222]. The optical hydrogel sensors are typically easy to
miniaturize and cost less to manufacture [226]. By molecular
design or chemical functionalization, hydrogels are able to possess
high sensitivities to specific chemical stimuli, which further
promise high selectivity and resolution for the chemical detection
and reaction monitoring [227—229]. In this section, four hydrogel-
based chemical sensors for different (bio)chemical analytes will be
introduced including their mechanisms of volumetric changes, the
structures of the sensing platforms, and their sensing performance.

As an important environmental factor, humidity, can be detec-
ted by a hydrogel interferometer based on the color variation
resulted from hydrogel volumetric changes [68]. Inspired by the
structure of cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) that can
rapidly adapt their skin colors to the environment by expanding or
contracting the chromatophores, Qin et al. demonstrated a bio-
inspired colorimetric humidity indicator based on a single hydro-
gel layer of poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid)
[DHEMA] and a reflective silicon wafer as the substrate (Fig. 5a, i).
The silicon substrate was first silanized to achieve covalent bonding
with the hydrogel layer. The bound hydrogel layer served as an
interferometer that was able to interfere the incident light waves at
both air—hydrogel and hydrogel—substrate interfaces (Fig. 5a, ii).
The wavelength of interfered light and thus the visible color were
correlated with the thickness of hydrogels; the hydrogel layer
experienced a thickness increment with a resultant sensitive color
change when exposed to a higher relative humidity level. As rela-
tive humidity changed from 45% to 93%, the thickness of the
hydrogel layer increased from 210 nm to 390 nm, resulting in a red
shift within their reflection spectra as a monocolor or multicolor
image pattern (Fig. 5a, ili, iv).

When the sensory hydrogel experiences some specific chemical
stimuli, the hydrogel matrix can bind with targeted ions or mole-
cules and induce resulting colorimetric changes. For example, Sun
et al. fabricated a hydrogel-based interferometer for ultrasensitive
(bio)chemical detection using poly (acrylamide-co-acrylic-acid-co-
N-allylacrylamide) (PAAm-PAAc-PAAene) with imidazole ligands
[222]. As shown in Fig. 5b, i, when the Cu?*+-containing analytical
solution diffused into the PAAm-PAAc-PAAene structure, Cu2* ions
were able to form Cu?*-imidazole complexes with the imidazole
ligands in such an imidazole-rich hydrogel. In this way, Cut
introduced additional cross-links of the hydrogel by bringing the
multiple surrounding polymer chains together. The increased
cross-links resulted in a denser hydrogel network. Hence, the
deformation behaviors of sensory hydrogel were able to be pro-
grammed by adjusting the ligand-to-analyte ratios, and the thick-
ness changes within a few nanometers were managed to be
detected through an optical interference that amplified the optical
signals. Compared to other 14 interfering metal ions (e.g. Ag*, Ba?*,
Ca**), the peak shift induced by Cu2* was significantly higher,
suggesting a high selectivity of this hydrogel sensor in identifying
Cu2* (Fig. 5b, ii). The hydrogel-based interferometer achieved the

low limits of detections of 10-'* M for Cu?* (Fig. 5b, iii) against
multiple interfering species in the mixture of analyte fluids. Such
ion sensitivities were 2—4 order-of-magnitude higher than the
ones of state-of-the-art methods.

Moreover, Elsherif et al. demonstrated a hydrogel-based optical
diffuser for glucose detection [223]. In this work, a phenyl boronic
acid (PBA)-functionalized hydrogel was designed as a glucose-
responsive system. Usually, PBA exists in an equilibrium between
an uncharged hydrophobic form and a charged hydrophilic form,
wherein both forms can react reversibly with 1,2-cis-diols of
glucose. The complex produced from hydrophobic form/glucose
reactions is highly susceptible to hydrolysis. While the reaction
between hydrophilic form of PBA and glucose can produce stable
and complex (hydrophilic phenyl borates). The reactions can shift
the equilibrium states of these two PBA forms to the direction of
increasing the hydrophilic form yet decreasing the hydrophobic
form [230]. The increased hydrophilic form can improve the
swelling degree of the cross-linked hydrogel and then induce
volumetric swelling (Fig. 5c, i). Such hydrogel deformations resul-
ted in the changes of diffusion spectra and transmitted beam pro-
files, which were detected by different focal lengths of the
microlenses (Fig. 5c, ii). The hydrogel-based optical diffuser pre-
sented an almost linear sensing response to various glucose con-
centrations with a sensibility of 11.6 w.W/mM in the range of
O—50 mM (Fig. 5c, iii).

Recently, Rivera-Tarazona et al. proposed a living synthetic
hydrogel composite with baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae or
S. cerevisiae) embedded in a PAAm hydrogel (Fig. 5d, i) [224].
Instead of ordinary swelling of a hydrogel, S. cerevisiae proliferated
and caused expansion in the hydrogel matrix in response to a
combination of environmental cues. For example, the proliferation
of S. cerevisiae highly depends on the conditions for cell growth. A
remarkable increase in volume change (200.9% + 2.4%) was
observed when the composites were incubated in the yeast extract
peptone dextrose (YPD) over 48 h (Fig. 5d, ii). For such living syn-
thetic hydrogel composites, the programming of the stimulus was
able to be achieved by genetic manipulation of the yeast.
S. cerevisiae used in this study was deficient in ,-histidine meta-
bolism that prevented proliferation in the absence of ,-histidine in
the growth environment. Hence, the volume of S. cerevisiae-con-
taining hydrogels grew up to 400% over 72 h in the medium con-
taining ,-histidine, which was 14 times higher than those in the
environment with ,-histidine or other amino acids (Fig. 5d, iii). By
introducing the above-mentioned colorimetric mechanism, the
shape-morphing living hydrogel is expected to enable biomedical
sensors that respond to specific stimuli in the environment.

6. Multifunctional hydrogel-based machines

Through careful macromolecular and structural engineering,
hydrogels demonstrated stimuli-responsive behaviors, either
transforming stimuli into actuating behaviors or recordable sensing
signals, which have been discussed in the above sessions. Yet, it
remained an ongoing challenge to achieve the multifunctional
hydrogels with stimuli-responsive morphing behaviors together
with other synergistic functions (e.g. sensing, self-healing) to
further expand their soft machine applications [21]. Conventional
approaches to implementing additional functions for soft machine
systems are generally realize by installing external electronics and
modules, which inevitably increase the complexity of ultimate
systems and also struggle with the incompatibility of each part
[234,235]. In contrast to the conventional soft robotic designs,
hydrogels, relying on their high mechanical compliance and read-
iness of modification, can serve as multifunctional soft bodies with
integrated robotic functions, including actuation, sensing, self-

healing, and camouflage. In this section, we will summarize several
recent innovations of soft hydrogel-based actuators/robots with
built-in multifunctionality. Four different approaches will be
introduced, including molecular design of polymeric networks,
ionic additive within composite hydrogels, and multi-unit robotic
configurations. In the end, a versatile method will be highlighted to
coat multifunctional hydrogel skin onto various objects with arbi-
trary shapes, which expand the exploitations of various functional
hydrogels onto existing robotic systems.

The rational molecular design of polymeric networks is a deli-
cate way to achieve soft hydrogel-based robots/actuators with
multifunctionality. As reported by Jiang et al., a double dynamic
network hydrogel with thermal responsiveness and self-healing

capability was produced [231]. The first hydrogel network was
based on well-defined poly (MAA-co-OEGMA) co-polymers, which
were prepared via reversible addition—fragmentation chain trans-
fer (RAFT) polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA) and oligo
(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA). The poly (MAA-co-
OEGMA) network effectively dissipated energy under mechanical
deformation, facilitated the self-healing behaviors via hydrogen
bonding, and provided the innate hydrophilicity. Furthermore, the
carboxylic groups of poly (MAA-co-OEGMA) were managed to get
functionalized with benzaldehyde groups, which further formed
dynamic covalent imine bonds as a second network. After a freeze-
thaw process, the hydrogel with the combination of hydrogen

mechanical properties as well as good self-healing capability. In
Fig. 6a, i, two pieces of hydrogels merged into one unit after close
contact for 2 min at room temperature. Moreover, poly (MAA-co-
OEGMA) possessed a adjustable thermoresponsiveness by chang-
ing the composition. With significantly more PMAA, the copolymer
could not respond to the temperature change. No LCST behaviors
were observed due to the formation of stronger hydrophobic
intramolecular acid—ether hydrogen bonding. In this way, a ther-
moresponsive hydrogel-based actuator was obtained by fabricating
a bilayer composite composed of the freeze-thawed hydrogel and a
non-responsive hydrogel (poly (MAAj36-co-BA34-OEGMA39)). The
soft actuator exhibited ultrafast thermal responsiveness (bending
384° in 8 s) and strong shape-morphing behaviors (Fig. 6a, il).
The physicochemical properties of hydrogels are capable of
being customized by incorporating ionic additives as well. Wen
et al. demonstrated a composite hydrogel with the multi-
functionality of hydroacoustic sensing and sonar antiscouting by
manipulating the adsorption and release of ionic additives within
the composite hydrogel [232]. The composite hydrogel was con-
structed by poly (N, N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAA) and exfoli-
ated Laponite® clay nanosheets via free radical polymerization and

incorporated with LiCl as ionic additives. The Li* ions were initially
stored on and in the clay nanosheets via electrostatic adsorption;
once receiving the signal of hydroacoustic wave oscillation (Fig. 6b,
i), the Lit ions escaped from the clay nanosheets, leading to the
increase of ionic conductivity of hydrogels. The PDMAA-clay
hydrogel with lithium chloride (LiCl) additive was able to serve as
a hydroacoustic sensor. As shown in Fig. 6b, ii, upon switching on
and off the 40 and 100 W ultrasounds, the PDMAA-clay hydrogel
experienced the cyclic changes of ionic conductivities and provided
real-time profiles of relative current changes. Besides the hydro-
acoustic sensitivity, the composite hydrogel also demonstrated
superior optical and sonic transparency (Fig. 6b, iii), high elasticity,
as well as antifreezing ability down to —65 °C. By adjusting the ionic
concentration, the PDMAA-clay hydrogel possessed several
advanced features such as high ionic conductivity and sensing so-
nar scanning, which was able to be incorporated into future designs
of underwater soft hydrogel-based actuators.

Another engineering opportunity to achieve soft hydrogel-
based soft devices with multifunctionality is to design multiple-
unit robotic configurations. For example, Du et al. developed an
untethered asymmetric hydrogel millirobot to implement

multimodal locomotion and environmentally adaptive functions
such as camouflage and color-shifting [233]. This hydrogel-based
millirobot was assembled by two units, a magnetic head (with
NdFeB magnetic nanoparticles) and a non-magnetic tail (made of
thermoresponsive PNIPAAm hydrogel). In response to magnetic
fields (Fig. 6c, i), the soft and asymmetric structure of this millirobot
enabled the controllable and transformable actuations, such as
crawling, swinging, and rolling in water, with the head of the
hydrogel-based robot as the propulsion. The effective propelling
enabled the robot to crawl through a small size tube (height:
~2 mm) in 24 s (Fig. 6c, ii). The transparent hydrogel tail realized
optical camouflage in water. Moreover, through controlling the
inverse opal microstructures within PNIPAAm hydrogel (Fig. 6c, iii,
iv), the structural color of millirobot tail demonstrated superior
thermoresponsiveness to the changing environmental tempera-
ture. As shown in Fig. 6c, v, the millirobot tail was able to quickly
change its color by a blue shift of Bragg diffraction from transparent
to blue due to the shrunk hydrogel networks, as the temperature
increased above LCST (36 °C). The combination of multiunit robotic
design and microstructural engineering demonstrated a great
example of multifunctional hydrogel-based robots with excellent
mobility and environmental sensitivity.

With the fast development of both functional hydrogels as well
as reconfigurable soft machine systems, it is desired to develop a
facile, scalable method to coat multifunctional hydrogels as ‘soft
skin’ onto the surface of existing machines. Yu et al. introduced a
interfacial interpenetration method (Fig. 6d, i) to coat thin and
uniform ‘hydrogel skins’ onto the surface of diverse polymers with
arbitrary shapes [47]. The polymer substrates were first treated
with hydrophobic initiators (e.g. benzophenone, 4-methyl benzo-
phenone, benzoyl peroxide, azobis solu butyronitrile) in organic
solution (e.g. ethanol, isopropanol, acetone) to form a diffusion
layer bound on the surface of the polymer substrate. And then the
treated polymer substrates were soaked in a hydrogel prior stage
gel solution consisting of hydrophilic initiators (e.g. Irgacure-2959,
a-ketoglutaric acid, ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate)
and hydrogel monomers (e.g. AAm, AA, N,N-dimethylacrylamide
(DMAA)) in aqueous solution. The hydrogel skin was formed after
subsequent curing (UV for photoinitiators, heat for thermo-initia-
tors) and rinsing processes. Most polymers are hydrophobic that
can swell in organic solvents for surface absorption of hydrophobic
initiators. The hydrophobic initiators served as grafting agents for
the hydrogel networks to cross-link with the polymer chains in the
substrates. The hydrophilic initiators containing hydrogel mono-
mers enabled polymerization of hydrogel polymers within and on
the surface of the treated polymer substrates.

With the highly conformal hydrogel coating (Fig. 6d, ii), many
polymers that suffer from incompatible mechanical/biochemical
properties with human body were able to expand their applica-
bility for clinical uses. For example, the hydrogel skins provided
superior antifouling properties compared with pure polymer sub-
strates and polymers with hydrogel coating by other methods. The
level of bacterial (Escherichia coli (E. coli)) adhesion of both thin and
thick hydrogel skins was significantly reduced. The high water
content of hydrogel skin was able to endow ionic conductivity to
the polymer devices by dissolving ionic species, which demon-
strated electrical resistance changes after stretching. Moreover, the
hydrogel skins provided highly lubricious interfaces of polymeric
soft robots. In Fig. 6d, ili, an Ecoflex drone with hydrogel skins for
leak detection showed a smoother travel process through the pipe
compared with a pristine Ecoflex drone. The fluctuations in travel
speed were reduced as well. With the tissue-like soft hydrogel
skins, the material selections and functions of soft robots can be
even broader.

7. Perspective

Historically, artificial hydrogels had limited technological ap-
plications since they were mechanically fragile, difficult to shape,
and exhibited minimal stimuli-responsive behavior. However,
recent advances in (nano)materials chemistry and digital fabrica-
tion have enabled next-generation hydrogels with dynamic func-
tions and durable structures [1,236]. These new materials have
immense potential as seamless biotic-abiotic interfaces, as well as
biocompatible devices for sensing, actuation, and communication.
The advantage of using these novel hydrogel materials is to design
multifunctional soft machines with enhanced intelligence and
durability without the potential increase of total weight or struc-
tural complexity.

Nevertheless, significant steps remain before hydrogels can be
widely utilized towards intelligent soft machine applications. First,
the actuation processes of stimuli-responsive hydrogels based on
water uptake and release are limited by their shape/thickness (e.g.
several hours for hydrogel actuators with centimeter size) [62] and
operation environments (e.g. ambient temperature, humidity). The
technical standards of performance testing are often customized by
each lab to eliminate the surrounding noises, while the real-time
responsiveness of hydrogel devices may not be stable in practical
applications with more complex environmental cues. Through
molecular design and structural engineering, the hydrogel can be
developed to be more stable and reliable to meet the real operation
conditions. For example, extra salt ions [237] or organohydrogels
[238] can expand the temperature range to below the freezing
point of water, which helps the hydrogel maintain flexibility at
extreme conditions.

Second, the multifunctional soft machines based on hydrogel
materials are still limited. So far, most relevant studies are managed
to demonstrate only a few functions on one piece of hydrogels. One
of the most promising approaches to develop novel functionalities
of hydrogel composites is introducing advanced low-dimensional
nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, MXene, etc.
to the hydrogel structures via heterogeneous blending, bilayer
integration, or processing subsequent to stabilization [21,239,240].
These fillers and additives can augment polymeric components
with unique physicochemical properties (e.g. fluorescence of
semiconductor quantum dots [241], superparamagnetism [242]).

Third, the rapid fabrication of soft machines has great potential
to develop fully autonomous soft machines, by advanced digital
fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing, although specific
optimization should be conducted for requirements of
manufacturing [243]. For example, the multimaterial 3D printing
techniques still face challenges to fabricate complex hydrogel soft
machines consisting of multiple components with different prop-
erties. Moreover, the printing resolution is crucial for the perfor-
mance of hydrogel devices, since it governs the higher degrees of
freedom with greater adaptability or faster responsiveness [244]. It
is also promising to combine the advanced hydrogel materials and
3D printing techniques to enable an extra dimension — time into
the 3D configurations, defined as 4D printing. In 4D printing, the
shape transformation is designed based on the initial layout and
achieved over time under stimuli [58]. This technique allows dy-
namic modulation of the hydrogel soft machine which holds great
promises in medical technology, soft robotics, and sensor tech-
nology [245]. However, currently available studies related to 4D
printed hydrogel devices are still insufficient that are unlikely to
meet the practical demands of advanced soft machine
manufacturing.

Ultimately, the most successful artificial machines can be
abstracted as a system of modular components that interact with
each other through well-defined protocols, which enables robust
14 M. Ding et al. / Materials Today Advances 8 (2020) 100088

performance [246]. However, hydrogel design and characterization
are too early-stage for end users to simply ‘plug and play’ different
components as they might with hard machines. In order to advance
the field, it is necessary for the materials synthesis and performance
testing to be generalized and optimized at scale. Many of the
hydrogels as mentioned have achieved complex functionalities
through sophisticated materials chemistry, which are used for
‘heroic’ proof-of-concept demonstrations. Although some special-
ized niche applications may permit one-off chemistries without
consideration of cost, most commercial applications will favor
simpler chemistries that are inexpensive and robust. The numerical
modeling related to their properties and performances would aid in
the material selection to optimize the performance-price ratio
[247,248]. This standardization of materials would be particularly
useful for the additive manufacturing of hydrogels on demand by
some end users at a distant location. Finally, the testing criteria and
metric of performance are slightly different in each lab, resulting in
ad-hoc measurements that are difficult to compare across publica-
tions. For example, some of the studies of hydrogel actuators eval-
uate the actuation in terms of bending angle (°) [249] to evaluate the
actuation, while some use curvature (mm!) [250]. The different
evaluation quantities may be confusing for different hydrogel sys-
tems regarding their size and thickness. The maturation of next-
generation hydrogels through the synergy of fundamental science
and technological application is expected to facilitate commercial-
ization and widespread usage to benefit human society.
