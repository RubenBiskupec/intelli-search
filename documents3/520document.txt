for deep learning based plant cell
assessment

Sumona Biswas@® & Shovan Barma®

We present a new large-scale three-fold annotated microscopy image dataset, aiming to advance the
plant cell biology research by exploring different cell microstructures including cell size and shape, cell
wall thickness, intercellular space, etc. in deep learning (DL) framework. This dataset includes 9,811
unstained and 6,127 stained (safranin-o, toluidine blue-o, and lugol’s-iodine) images with three-fold
annotation including physical, morphological, and tissue grading based on weight, different section
area, and tissue zone respectively. In addition, we prepared ground truth segmentation labels for three
different tuber weights. We have validated the pertinence of annotations by performing multi-label
cell classification, employing convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, for unstained and stained
images. The accuracy has been achieved up to 0.94, while, F2-score reaches to 0.92. Furthermore, the
ground truth labels have been verified by semantic segmentation algorithm using UNet architecture
which presents the mean intersection of union up to 0.70. Hence, the overall results show that the data
are very much efficient and could enrich the domain of microscopy plant cell analysis for DL-framework.

Background & Summary

Microscopy image analysis by employing machine learning (ML) techniques advances the critical understanding
of several characteristics of biological cells, ranging from the visualization of biological structures to quantifica-
tion of phenotypes. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the area of ML, especially, in computer

: vision technology by evidencing vast technological breakthroughs in several domains of image recognition tasks

including object detection, medical and bio-image analysis, and so on. In general, the ML implicates complex sta-
tistical techniques on a set of images and its recognition efficiency heavily relies on the handcrafted data features;
whereas, the DL processes the raw image data directly and crams the data representation automatically. Indeed,
its performance highly depends on the large number of diverse images with accurate and applicable labelling.
Following the trend, the DL is emerging as a powerful tool for microscopy image analysis, such as cell segmen-
tation, classification, and detection by exploring the dynamic variety of cells. Moreover, the DL pipeline allows
discovering the hidden cell structures, such as single-cell size, number of cells in a given area, cell wall thickness,
intercellular space distribution, subcellular components, and its density, etc. from microscopy images by extract-
ing the complex data representation in hierarchical way. Meanwhile, it expressively diminishes the burden of
feature engineering in traditional ML.

Certainly, several works have been attempted in cell biology and digital pathology domain to provide quanti-
tative support in automatic diagnosis and prognosis by detecting mitosis, nucleus, cells, and the number of cells
from breast cancer'”, brain tumour’, and retinal pigment epithelial cell* images in DL framework. Consequently,
the DL network successfully applied in plant biology for stomata classification, detection?~’, and counting’, plant
protein subcellular localization’, xylem vessels segmentations’°, and plant cell segmentation for automated cells
tracking'!’”. Therefore, it is necessary to assemble a large number of annotated microscopy images and its ground
truth for the successful application of DL based microscopy image analysis'’. Certainly, there are numerous pub-
licly available microscopy image datasets, mostly medical images for DL based diagnosis and prognosis, such as
Human Protein Atlas’, H&E-stained tissue slides from the Cancer Genome Atlas’, DeepCell Dataset'®!”, Mitosis

detection in breast cancer'®, lung cancer cell'’. In contrast, there are very few number of publicly accessible bio-
logical microscopy image datasets of plant tissue cells, which are suitable for the DL framework. Furthermore, the
existing datasets have limited number of diverse images with proper annotation. In such context, we have gener-
ated an optical microscopy image dataset of potato tuber with a larger number of diverse images, and appropriate
annotation. This publicly available dataset will be beneficial in analysing the plant tissue cells with great details by
employing DL based techniques.

Microscopy image analysis has become more reliable in understanding the structure, texture, geometrical
properties of plant cells and tissues which pay a profound impact on botanical research. Such studies have sig-
nificant aspects in interpreting the variety of different plant cells, tissues, and organs by discriminating cell size,
shape, orientation, cell wall thickness, distribution, and size of intracellular spaces”’, tissue types, and mechani-
cal*!* properties like shear, compressive stiffness etc. For instance, the shape and size of cell guides to determine
the size and texture’ of a plant organ; while, the tissue digestibility and plant productivity”*”’ are controlled by
the cell wall thickness; similarly, the mechanical properties of the cell wall plays a crucial role in plant stability
and resistance against pathogens”®; whereas, the intercellular spaces influence the physical properties of tissues,
like firmness, crispness, and mealiness’’. Certainly, it has been practiced in various domains of plant cell research,
such as fruits and vegetables*’*. In this connection, there are various ways to generate microscopy images, such
as brightfield microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy. All these methods have their own
advantages and disadvantages as well. Besides, sample preparation is one of the crucial steps in microscopy image
generation which includes fixation, paraffin embedding, and different staining techniques for better visualization
of cell segments. The most widely used stains are safranin-o”*”° and toluidine blue-o°! for visualizing cell walls
and lugol’s iodine*’ for starch detection.

In this view, we present a large brightfield optical microscopy image dataset of plant tissues of potato tuber, as
it is one of the principal and high productive tuber crops and a valuable component of our regular diet. Usually,
potato tubers are of oval or round shape with white flesh and pale brown skin with bud and stem end. Three major
parts of the tuber are cortex, perimedullary zone (outer core), and pith (inner core) with medullary rays, which
are made up of parenchyma cells. The cell structures are distinct for different tuber variety’’, even within the same
tuber, especially inner core and outer core**. The same structural differences can also be observed between the
stem and bud ends. In addition, the cell division and enlargement in various regions play an important role*’ on
potato tuber growth. Following such variations in cell structure, we have generated a large dataset consisting of
15,938 fully annotated unstained and stained images with three-fold labelling. The labelling has been prepared
based on the tuber size (large, medium, and small), collections area (bud, middle and stem part), and tissue zones
(inner and outer core) and the images have been graded as physical, morphological and tissue grading respec-
tively. In addition, 60 ground truth segmentation labels of the images from the inner core have been prepared for
the different tuber weight. To check the quality of the images, technical validation has been conducted by the DL
based classification and segmentation tasks, which displayed significant recognition accuracy. Thus, this dataset
is very much suitable for studying plant cell microstructures including cell size and shape, cell wall thickness,
intercellular space, starch, and cell density distribution in potato tubers using DL based pipeline. Indeed, such
properties can be explored explicitly as the dataset includes the images from the entire region of the tuber cov-
ering two tissue zones from stem to bud end for different tuber weights. In addition, large number of images in
this dataset will provide new opportunities for evaluating and developing DL based plant biology classification
and segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, the unstained along with stained images will be suitable to develop
virtual-staining algorithms in the DL framework. Therefore, the dataset could enrich the DL based microscopy
cell assessment in plant biology substantially.

Methods

Potato tuber selection and microscopic specimen preparation. The raw potato tubers (Solanum
tuberosum L.) of an Indian variety, Kufri Pukhraj have been chosen in this work. The Kurfi Pukhraj, an excellent
source of vitamin C, potassium, and fibre is one of the popularly grown commercial cultivars in India. The tubers
have been collected immediately after harvesting in mid of December 2019 from Kamrup, a district of Assam
state, India. All the samples without any outer damages have been collected and stored in the temperature of
19.2 °C-29.2°C with 70% relative air humidity. Based on the weight of the tuber, samples have been graded into
large, medium, and small of weight 80-100 gm, 40-50 gm, and 15-25 gm respectively. From each of these groups,
5 samples (total of 15 samples) have been selected for image generation at the laboratory maintaining stable
room temperature and humidity. The whole experiment including collection of the tuber samples and image
generation has been accomplished in 20 days. Different graded tuber samples are chosen alternate days during
the experiment.

The major parts of potato tuber, periderm (skin) with the bud and stem ends, cortex, perimedullary zone
(outer core), and pith (inner core) with medullary rays have been displayed in Fig. 1b,c. The periderm, the outer-
most layer, protects a tuber from dehydration, infection, and wounding during harvest and storage. The cortex,
outer core, and inner core tissues appear successively after the skin where starch granules are stored in paren-
chyma cells. The thickness of the cortex is about 146-189 um” and the largest cells are found here. The outer
core spreads about 75% of the total tuber volume and contains the maximum amount of starch*’. The innermost
region i.e., inner core expands from stem to bud end*® along longitude direction; whereas, the medullary rays
spread toward the cortex. The samples have been collected from the inner and outer core which covers most of
the areas of a tuber. Besides, the cell structures** and the amount of starch are distinct in these two tissue zones.
Similar samples have been collected from three areas, named Z1, Z2, and Z3 as indicated in Fig. 1b. The samples
have been extracted with a cork borer of a diameter of 4mm and rinsed in distilled water. After that, 5 thin sec-
tions from the inner core as well as the outer core of each of the three areas have been collected. Therefore, from
a tuber sample, 30 thin sections (5 sections x3 section areas x2 tissue zones) have been analysed. Furthermore,

microscope eyepiece by using an adaptor. Two types of microscopy images, unstained and stained images have
been captured independently without drying the sections.

to capture images, fresh thin potato sections (i-e., unstained samples) have been placed under the microscope.
In addition, for the better visualization of cell boundaries and subcellular components, especially starch, the
samples have been stained. Safranin-o (1% solution) and toluidine blue-o (0.05% solution) has been used to vis-
ualize all cell walls; whereas, lugol’s iodine solution helped to distinguish starch granules. An optical microscope
(Labomed Lx300, Labomed America) accompanied by a smartphone camera (Redmi Note 7 Pro) was used to
generate and capture microscopy images as shown in Fig. 1f. The brightfield microscopy images have been gen-
erated using a 10x lens (field number = 18, numerical aperture = 1.25) which provides a field of view (FOV) of
diameter 0.18 mm. The camera of the smartphone has been fixed on the microscope eyepiece by using an adaptor.
Certainly, the exposure and white balance state has been secured by the adequate brightness level of the micro-
scopes built-in light-emitting diode (LED) and a clear FOV. The exposure time of the smartphone camera has
been kept in the range of 1/200 s— 1/100 which provides satisfactory brightness level; whereas, the focus setting
of the camera has been locked that maintains fixed magnification among all the images. The images have been
captured in the highest quality JPG format with maximum of 10% compression only to retain the image quality
reasonably high. The mobile camera has been fixed to 3x zoom which offers a FOV of 890 x 740 um? with an
approximate resolution of 0.26 um/pixel. Following this setting, three images have been taken for each field of
view by changing the focus distance of 3 um. Similarly, around 15 images have been acquired from a section by
continuous precision shifting of the microscope stage along the x-y plane before the samples get dried. Thus, in
total 9,811 unstained and 6,127 stained images have been captured and saved in JPG format in 24-bit RGB color
and of resolution 3650 x 3000.

Image grading. Previous studies identified that the potato tuber weight is directly associated with the num-
ber of cells and cell volume in different tissue zones. Nevertheless, the cell numbers are considered as a significant
factor compared to mean cell volume for a tuber weight variation®’. Hence, potato tuber weight has been recog-
nized as one of the important physical parameters to achieve versatility in the image database. Therefore, in this
work, based on the weight, potato tubers are categorized into three groups as large, medium, and small. Certainly,
the captured microscopic images are composed of discrete cells with thin nonlignified cell walls surrounded by
starch granules”. In a tuber, the cell size differs considerably in the two tissue zones— inner and outer core**. In
general, the outer core occupies the maximum volume of the tuber and stores the largest number of starch gran-
ules as reserve material. On the contrary, the inner core cells are smaller** with lower starch content which makes
this tissue zone wet and translucent as displayed in Fig. 2. Such variation of cell sizes and starch distribution can
be observed in the stem, bud, and middle section of tubers as well. Therefore, the images have been graded into
three categories namely (1) physical grading, (2) morphological grading and, (3) tissue grading based on tuber
weight, section areas, and tissue zones respectively.

Physical grading. ‘Tubers of three different weight ranges have been selected for the image dataset, as it has a
correlation with the cell features. Three different weight groups of tubers, such as large (L), medium (M), and
small (S) with weight 80-100 gm, 40-50 gm and 15-25 gm respectively, have been considered for this microscopy
image dataset. The generated images have been labelled with L, M, and S followed by sample number 1-5 to dis-
tinguish tuber weight along with sample number; for instance, L1 refers to the first sample of a large tuber. The
labels associate with weights and related parameters along with sample numbers for physical grading have been
listed in Table 1.

Morphological grading. The bud and stem ends of potato tubers are connected with the apical and basal end of
the shoot respectively. These areas displayed compositional variations*!” with distinct cell features. The images
of the tuber middle part (separates the bud, and stem end) have been incorporated in this dataset to visualize
structural variations along the longitudinal direction. Therefore, for morphological grading, the tubers have been
divided into three parts namely Z1, Z2, and Z3 which specify the bud, middle, and stem areas respectively as
shown in Fig. 1b. Certainly, the images have been captured from these areas for each physically graded sample
and labelled accordingly.

Tissue grading. A significant variation in cell sizes within the same potato tuber can be observed in inner core
and outer core tissue zones. ‘The cell size of the outer core is larger than that of the inner core and contains most of
the starch material. Therefore, in tissue grading, these two zones have been identified. Certainly, the images have
been captured from these zones for each morphologically graded sample and labelled as IC and OC which indi-
cates the inner and outer core of the potato tuber respectively. Example of unstained and stained images of large,
medium, and small potato tuber from different section areas and tissue zones have been displayed in Figs. 3-5
respectively.

Database Summary

There are total 15,938 (9,811 unstained and 6,127 stained) numbers of images in this dataset. The images are
categorized based on different grading and labelling basis, and listed in Table 2. The first two columns refer to
grading and labelling basis followed by the number of images for unstained and stained cases. Furthermore, the
stained images with three stains (safranin-o, toluidine blue-o, and lugol’s iodine) are also specifically mentioned.

Ground truth label generation for cell boundary segmentation. Segmentation is performed
to split an image into several parts to identify meaningful features or objects. In microscopy image analysis,
a common problem is to identify distinct parts which correspond to a single cell or cell components to quan-
tify the spatial and temporal coordination. Furthermore, as a precursor to geometric analysis, such as cell size
and its distributions, image segmentation is essential. Such a task can be performed manually, which is very
much time-consuming, irreproducible, and tedious for larger image sets. Nonetheless, it can be automated by
the ML techniques which require proper ground truth labels. Therefore, we have generated ground truth labels
of cell boundaries for the automated segmentation task. The images have been captured from different parts of
the tubers as mentioned earlier, and labelled accordingly. Certainly, to generate the ground truth labels for cell
boundary segmentation, the unstained images of inner core from the Z2 area have been selected, as cell bounda-
ries are comparatively prominent in this zone due to presence of fewer amounts of starch granules.
Segmentation of potato cell images can be very much challenging because of its complex cell boundaries and
non-uniformity in image background which leads to poor contrast between cell boundary and background.
Therefore, to generate the ground truth cell boundaries, a few steps have been involved: (1) pre-processing (2)
thresholding, and (3) morphological operations. The pre-processing steps have been mainly implicated in back-
ground correction and image filtering. Generally, the uneven thickness of the tuber section results non-uniform
microscopy image background. Thus, to minimize such non-uniformity a well-known rolling ball algorithm****
has been employed. It eliminates the unnecessary background information by converting a 2D image I(x,y) into
a 3D surface; where, the pixel values are considered as the height. Then, a ball of a certain radius (R) is rolled over
the backside of the surface which creates a new surface S(x,y). Furthermore, a new image with a uniform

background is created by, I,,,,,,(x, y) = (I(x, y) + 1) — (S(x, y) — R)*. To achieve an optimal image with the best
uniform background, the values of R must be selected carefully. In our work, empirically, the values of R have
been kept as 30 < R < 60. Next, for image filtering, bandpass filter has been used to enhance the cell edges by
eliminating shading effects. In this purpose, Gaussian filtering in Fourier space has been considered. A bandpass
filter having two cut-off frequencies, lower (f,;) and higher (f,,) are kept within a range for intensity variation in
the captured image. Empirically, it has been kept as 10 < fy < 30 and 60 < fj, < 120. Furthermore, the adaptive
thresholding method* has been implemented to binarize the images for discriminating the cell boundaries.
Moreover, morphological operators, such as opening, closing, and hole filling has been chosen to refine cell
boundaries. Several values of f;, fj,, and R have been chosen to get the best binary images. Although, very few
starch granules and some disconnected cell boundaries can be observed in the resultant binary images, which
could lead to a weak cell boundary segmentation. Certainly, such discrepancies have been further refined by very
well-known manual process*° which involves removal of the starch granules and contouring cell boundaries. The
whole process of cell boundary segmentation ground truth label generation has been shown in Fig. 6.

image labels information can be extracted from the image filenames itself. The file naming format for unstained
image is as < physical grading with sample no. >_< morphological grading > _ < tissue grading > _ < section

from the inner core of Z1 of medium weight potato tuber (sample no. 1). Similarly, the stained image file naming
format is as < physical grading with sample no. >_< morphological grading > _ < tissue grading >_< section
no. >_< stain type >_< image no.>; for example, S$1_Z2_OC_Sec. 3_lugol_02.jpg refers to an lugol’s iodine
stained image (third section out of five) taken from the outer core of Z2 of small weight potato tuber (sample
no. 1). The whole file naming format can be understood by following Table 3. The segmentation folder con-
tains two subfolders, named as “images” and “groundtruth” The image files naming format is as < physical grad-
ing >_<image no. >; for example, “L_2.jpg” represents the second image of a large potato tuber sample. Besides,
the ground truth label images are kept in binary image format having the same dimensions of the raw images.

Technical Validation

The technical validation has been conducted by employing the DL based classification and segmentation tasks
on the acquired image dataset as illustrated in Fig. 7. Multi-label cell classification has been conducted to verify
the quality of the assigned labels. It has been examined by considering two specific image labels— physical (L,
M, and S) and tissue grading (IC and OC). Besides, to verify the ground truth segmentation labels, semantic

segmentation has been performed using the DL pipeline. The first test can yield information about the possible
separation of labels and the later can access individual cells in different tuber weights.

Multi-label cell classification. The CNN classification network, VGG16** has been employed for
multi-label cell classification using input images of 256 x 256 pixels with two labels, physical (L, M, and S)
and tissue grading (IC and OC). The first 13 layers of the neural network have been pre-trained on ImageNet
[ILSVRC2012] dataset. On top of it, task-specific fully-connected layers have been attached and activated by the
sigmoid function. The complete network has been fine-tuned on our datasets. The network performance has been
evaluated based on the train-test scheme. Therefore, the entire image dataset (unstained and stained) has been
partitioned randomly into two subsets, with 80% for training and 20% for test. The network has been trained
using SGD” optimizer with a learning rate of 10-*, momentum 0.9, and the binary cross-entropy as loss function
for both the image dataset. With the iterative learning technique, performance metrics, such as accuracy and
F2-score (assessing the correctness of the image labels), have been obtained for test images. The results have been
listed for the test set in Table 4. It shows that for the same number of epochs (30), the unstained image dataset
gives a better result than the stained image dataset.

Cellsegmentation. In this task, Unet”’, a very well recognized image segmentation neural network has been
employed. It has shown remarkable performance in biomedical image segmentation. The input images have been
generated by subdividing each ground truth labels and raw images into 20 sub-images, which further resized to
512 x 512 pixels before training. The network has been trained using Adam” optimizer with learning rate of 107".
Two types of inputs, namely raw and normalized images have been given separately into the network. The entire

images have been chosen independently. The image labels have been verified by VGG16** deep neural network
employing transfer learning. The Unet”’ architecture has been used to employ the semantic segmentation using
the generated ground truth segmentation labels and hence verify the same.

formance evaluation has been conducted by employing normal adaptive learning rate-based training. During the
training period, early stopping has been used to choose the model with the highest validation performance. The
mean intersection of union (IOU) has been chosen as a performance metric that measures how much predicted
boundary overlaps with the ground truth (real cell boundary) and the results have been displayed in Table 5. For
the same deep neural network, normalize input images give better result than the raw images. A representative
