Full list of author information is to facilitate idea generation and maintain shared focus during discussion. This study

available at the end of the article employs the Reciprocal Kit-Build (RKB) approach as a designed activity to support
collaborative concept mapping. Though previous studies show the RkB is promising to
promote productive discussion and achieve high-quality group products, they have
not investigated how individual knowledge differences may potentially influence the
effectiveness of collaboration. This study aims to identify the effect of group
composition on learning effectiveness at the level of interaction between individual and
group and at the level of the group as a whole. At the interaction level, we investigate
the amount of knowledge transfer from shared and unshared individual knowledge to
group solutions, while at the group level, the quality of collaborative maps is evaluated.
Moreover, we explore the affective responses of learners during designated activities. A
single group design is applied to illustrate the learning activities in a practical
classroom settings where all students receive the same treatment. Our findings show
that the transfer of individual shared and unshared knowledge is considerably high in
all group conditions. Group composition does not significantly affect knowledge
transfer and final group-outcome products; however, it may induce learners to
experience different affective states. The results are essential for practitioners who
intend to apply the RKB in their classroom to determine the appropriate group settings.

Introduction

A central question of research and practice in computer-supported collaborative learning
is how learners within a group influence each other and manage to converge regarding
their knowledge (Fischer et al. 2002; Weinberger et al. 2007). Convergence of knowledge
is defined as occurring when the activities of two or more learners have an impact on
those of their partners, which impact their own activities in turn (Roschelle 1992). Jeong
and Chi state that a similarity of knowledge may be achieved because group members
experience the same environmental and cultural conditions or collaboratively interpret
a situation or solve a problem together (Jeong and Chi 2007). We therefore believe that
the design of a learning environment, including activities and tasks, is a critical factor in
obtaining knowledge convergence following a collaborative session.

Preconceptions and divergence in knowledge influence the benefits experienced by
group members when learning collaboratively (Weinberger and Fischer 2006). To pro-
mote the negotiation of perspectives towards shared understanding, prior studies on
collaborative learning suggest the use of heterogeneous group composition (Weinberger
et al. 2007; Johnson and Johnson 1987; Webb 2009). In a heterogeneous situation, we
expected group members would constructively build on different ideas, thus promot-
ing similarities of knowledge. While previous research confirms that nurturing group
members to use available knowledge is beneficial in helping learners to attain knowl-
edge convergence, unfortunately, it is also found that groups often neglect unshared
resources—that is, knowledge and information that only a small number of the group
possess or have access to (Fischer and Mandl 2002). This emphasizes the need for a struc-
tured and open collaborative-learning environment where individuals actively exchange,
build, and elaborate the shared and unshared knowledge resources of the group.

In this study, we use a concept map as an external-representation tool of students’
mental models (schemata). The concept map is a graphical structure that illustrates
one’s cognitive knowledge, consisting of concepts and the relationships between concepts
(links) (Novak and Gowin 1984). Since individual knowledge structures (i.e., schemata
or mental models) are not directly observable, an externalized representational tool is
required to explain the complex phenomena of human learning, reasoning, and problem-
solving (Ifenthaler 2010; Hirashima and Hayashi 2016). Manipulation of such external
representation may promote sophistication of internal representation (learning). Hay,
Kinchin, and Baker describe four important uses of concept mapping in higher education:
to identify students’ prior knowledge, to facilitate meaningful learning, to share knowl-
edge and understanding between teachers and learners, and to detect learners’ conceptual
changes (Hay et al. 2008).

The concept map has been widely employed in collaboration to facilitate idea genera-
tion, maintain shared focus, and negotiate meaning (Basque and Lavoie 2006). Utilizing
a concept map during collaboration supports the collaborative-learning process (i.e.,
knowledge elicitation and negotiation), since the cognitive structure of learners is made
visible and ready to manipulate (Fischer and Mandl 2002). The use of a concept map
to represent group-shared understanding has positively impacted learning achievements,
both at individual and group level (Stoyanova and Kommers 2002). At the individual
level, the concept map allows knowledge to become more explicit and provides room
for reflection and elaboration of cognition (Stoyanova and Kommers 2002), while at the
group level, the concept map promotes the establishment of common ground as a basis

for building shared understanding among group members (Jeong and Hmelo-Silver 2016;
Roschelle and Teasley 1995; Stoyanova and Kommers 2002). A concept map is an effec-
tive tool for the elicitation of knowledge and for communicating complex ideas (Fischer
and Mandl 2002; Stoyanova and Kommers 2002; Suthers 2006; van Boxtel et al. 2000).
Moreover, studies have found that collaborative concept mapping activity encourages stu-
dents’ positive attitudes, e.g., by increasing group motivation, reducing members’ anxiety,
and increasing students’ responsibility for learning (Beers et al. 2006; Czerniak and Haney
1998; van Boxtel et al. 2002).

Though studies of collaborative concept maps show promising results, variations in
learning activities have been encouraged to assist more productive interaction, such
as including an individual-preparation phase or a sharing of the group members’ con-
cept maps before the collaborative session (Fischer and Mandl 2002; Engelmann and
Hesse 2010). By adding the individual-preparation phase, each learner can develop their
own understanding, which results in a better explanation of individual knowledge and
more elaboration during discourse (Fischer and Mandl 2002; van Boxtel et al. 2000;
Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017). Sharing partners’ knowledge structures beforehand has suc-
cessfully increased awareness of others’ knowledge, causing learners to focus directly on
different perspectives (Engelmann and Hesse 2010; Engelmann et al. 2014). Active review-
ing of group members’ initial maps positively affects the broadness of group solutions to
problems (Stoyanova and Kommers 2002).

The current study has extended collaborative concept mapping with the kit-build (KB)
method, a re-constructional concept mapping approach to assess common understand-
ing between a teacher and their students (Hirashima et al. 2015; Hirashima 2019). The KB
method allows students to create concept maps based on predefined map components
that come from the teacher’s map. During map construction, the learners need to find the
concept map structure. After all students complete their maps, the KB system visualizes
all map similarities and differences to the teacher. Concept-map evaluation can thereby
be realized instantaneously; in consequence, both teacher and students receive imme-
diate feedback. In classroom practice, the KB analyzer has been used to find learners’
misconceptions and to improve the teacher’s lesson plan for the subsequent class
(Yoshida et al. 2013; Pailai et al. 2017). KB automatic assessment achieved almost
the same level of validity as well-known concept map manual assessment methods
(Wunnasri et al. 2018).

Standard KB practice involves interaction between a teacher and their students, who
have different levels of expertise regarding the subject field. While many studies are con-
cerned with the effect of the KB method on individual learning (Yoshida et al. 2013;
Hirashima et al. 2015; Pailai et al. 2016; Kitamura et al. 2019; Alkhateeb et al. 2016),
only a few studies have evaluated its effectiveness in a collaborative context. An exten-
sion of KB for peer-to-peer learning, the RKB, allows students to generate and exchange
ideas with a partner before co-construction of a concept map. Learning activities dur-
ing the RKB session consists of three main parts, i.e., individual map building, individual
map reconstruction by partners, and difference map discussion (Wunnasri et al. 2018a).
Initial studies conducted by Wunnasri et al. (2018a); Wunnasri et al. (2018b) find that
the KB approach promoted more exploratory talk during group discussion and assisted
group members to develop similar understanding, based on their individual first and post

hoc maps. Those studies do not, however, take into account how individual knowledge
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:13 Page 4 of 19

is elaborated while constructing a collaborative map as an artifact that represents group
consensus and shared understanding.

When RKB was put into practical use for collaborative concept mapping in a Linear
Algebra class, almost all groups produced a high-quality collaborative map and there was
an association between difference map visualization and individual-to-group-score gain
(Sadita et al. 2018). The same study presents how group maps changed according to the
KB visualization of different links; however, it did not investigate how individual differ-
ences in prior knowledge in each group may influence collaborative-learning effectiveness
(e.g., transfer of knowledge, lost knowledge, group product) and the students’ feelings
about the learning process itself. This investigation is needed to draw a comprehensive
understanding of the effectiveness of the KB approach, as well as to provide suggestions
for practitioners who want to apply the KB method in the classroom environment.

The present study aims to identify the effect of differences in group composition
on learning effectiveness in two dimensions—i.e., interaction between group members
and group achievement—based on measurements proposed by some previous stud-
ies (Khamesan and Hammond 2004; Stoyanova and Kommers 2002). To determine the
homogeneity of group composition, we used the knowledge convergence measurement
defined by (Weinberger et al. 2007), which distinguishes group knowledge equivalence
and shared knowledge (Khamesan and Hammond 2004; Stoyanova and Kommers 2002).
Furthermore, learners’ perceptions of the learning activities were evaluated to find
out their affective responses to different group compositions. The following research
questions guide our study:

(a) What are the overall patterns of knowledge transfer from individual-to-group
representation?

(b) Does similarity of knowledge affect students’ learning effectiveness in the two
dimensions (i.e., interaction of individual members and group level), and, if so, to
what extent?

(c) Does similarity of knowledge affect the experiences of participants in the study,
and, if so, to what extent?

Method

Participant characteristics

The study was conducted in a Linear Algebra class for first year Computer Science stu-
dents in a public university in Indonesia. The participants consisted of 42 students, of
whom 71% were men. The subject aimed to provide students with tools for problem solv-
ing and mathematical thinking, especially in pattern finding and abstraction (Junus et
al. 2014). In line with these goals, class activities mainly adopted student-centered and
social-constructivist learning theories. The topics covered during the 16-week semester
included linear equations, matrix algebra, vector space, inner product space, eigenvectors
and eigenspace, and linear transformation and its applications for computation.

For the experiment, the teacher selected the topics of General Vector Spaces and Inner
Product Spaces. The notion of vector as an element of a vector space was a new concept to
most of the students, since they had previously studied vectors only as objects with both
magnitude and direction. The accommodation of prior concepts within a new context

remains a challenge for the teacher. It was therefore necessary to apply active learning
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:13 Page 5 of 19

methods, e.g., the use of concept maps in which students could draw their new conceptual
knowledge and discuss it with their learning partners. The students were familiar with
concept mapping activities, since the teacher had previously drawn schemata to show the
relationships between concepts or asked the students to construct their own maps after
completing a learning topic. The teacher detected students’ misconceptions through their
concept maps (Junus 2018).

Experimental settings

The study implemented a single-group design where all participants received the same
treatment and were observed in their natural settings. Before conducting the experi-
ment, an introductory explanation and some relevant learning resources on the topics
were delivered to the classroom and through a learning management system. The teacher
determined some essential concepts (nodes) (1 = 15) to be included in the map, i.e., Inner
Product (IP) Space, Vector Space (VS), IP function, domain: V x V, co-domain: R, addi-
tivity axiom, homogeneity axiom, positivity axiom, symmetry axiom, vector, orthogonal
projection, distance between two vectors, length of a vector, angle between two vectors,
and directed line segment. By having the nodes provided, the students were able to iden-
tify common references and maintain shared focus during discourse. Hence, they were
asked to draw relationships (links) among the nodes and define the linking words to form
a concept map.

The experiment was administered in a computer laboratory for around 2 h and was
divided into two main phases: individual and collaborative. First, each participant built
their own map using a computer. After submitting the map online, they were requested
to construct another map based on the nodes and links (components) from their part-
ner’s first map. During the second, collaborative phase, the KB system visualized the
similarities and differences between each individual’s first map and the correspond-
ing partner’s map. The students discussed the ideas facilitated by the visualization,
and, finally, they were asked to create an integrative group map together. Figure 1
illustrates the activities of participants during the experiment. They worked in close
proximity during individual map construction, then built the group map using just
one computer.

The participants chose their partners beforehand, according to their preferences. Group
randomization was not applied to encourage active participation and open communica-
tion. For the analysis, we clustered groups based on the similarity of their prior knowledge
and shared knowledge about the task. The teacher attended the experiment and gave
instructions, but did not intervene in students’ discussions. She provided feedback to par-
ticipants, based on their individual and group maps, since it was necessary to clarify their
understanding, but only did this several days after the completion of the experiment. We
also conducted a survey to capture learners’ perceptions of the activities themselves.

Variables and measurements

There are three variables in this study: similarity of knowledge, learning effectiveness,
and learners’ affective responses. Similarity of knowledge was determined based on the
students’ mid-term scores and their individual (first) maps; learning effectiveness was
measured from the collaborative (final) maps and the similarity of contents between the
individual and collaborative maps; the affective responses of the learners were captured

Similarity of knowledge

Weinberger, Stegmann, and Fischer conceptualize knowledge convergence as knowledge
equivalence and shared knowledge, which can be evaluated prior to, during, or after col-
laboration (Weinberger et al. 2007). In order to identify similarity of knowledge within
each group, we used two types of measurements: prior-knowledge equivalence and shared
knowledge. Knowledge equivalence refers to learners in a group possessing a similar
degree of knowledge related to a specified subject, regardless of the specific concepts
constituting knowledge content (Weinberger et al. 2007), while shared knowledge alludes
to the knowledge of specific concepts that learners within a group have in common
(Weinberger et al. 2007).

The prior-knowledge equivalence scores were calculated from the results of a mid-
term test conducted a few days before the experiment. The questions in the test covered
essential introductory materials required to understand the main topic in the concept
map, but did not include the conceptual knowledge that could be drawn in a map form,
such as the relationships between concepts. Measures of dispersion were used to ana-
lyze differences in prior knowledge, as in a prior study (Weinberger et al. 2007). First,
individual mid-term tests were evaluated by the teacher. Second, the standard deviation
between the scores and the average scores in each group was calculated. Last, the stan-
dard deviation was divided by the mean score to measure the coefficient of variation as a
prior-knowledge-equivalence score.

We assessed shared knowledge quantitatively from the individual maps using the
approach proposed by Weinberger et al. (2007). First, the teacher defined the essential
information to be included in the maps. Then, she listed all possible and common sub-
structures from all student-generated maps. A substructure may consist of two or more
connected nodes (concepts) that convey only one essential piece of information (see
Table 1). Variation in substructures was also deemed acceptable, depending on the link-
ing words written by the students. Second, the teacher marked whether a student’s map
exhibited any of the essential information or not. A maximum of seven important sub-
structures was expected to appear in the maps. Third, if a pair of learners shared the
ability to apply a specific concept, we added a shared-prior-knowledge score of 1. Finally,
we normalized the score by dividing it by the group mean value. In addition, we counted
the number of unshared substructures at the individual level to identify information
possessed only by a single member.

Table 2 provides a sample of knowledge distribution in a group. Following the above
procedure, the individual-knowledge scores of students A and B in group 01 were 3 and
2, respectively, based on the number of correct substructures, resulting in a mean of
2.5. Group 01 achieved a shared-knowledge value of 2 because both members were able

to draw the first and the fourth substructures correctly. Consequently, the normalized
shared-knowledge score of this group was 2 / 2.5 (i.e., 0.8).

The normalized prior-knowledge-equivalence score and shared-knowledge score were
applied to categorize the group. Groups with normalized prior-knowledge-equivalence
scores of less than 0.2 were categorized as high-knowledge-equivalence groups, and
groups with normalized shared-knowledge scores of more than 0.7 were categorized as
high-shared-knowledge groups. The prior-knowledge-equivalence scores provided the
different levels of individual performance on prior relevant topics, while the shared-
knowledge scores were more specific to knowledge related to the task itself.

Learning effectiveness measurements

To measure learning effectiveness, this study employed collaborative concept map-
analysis methods proposed by Khamesan and Hammond (Khamesan and Hammond
2004), which extend the initial works of Stoyanova and Kommers (2002). Khamesan and
Hammond divide learning effectiveness into three levels: the level of individual learn-
ing, the level of a group as a whole, and the level of interaction between individual and
group. This scoring system achieved a high inter-rater reliability score, with correlations

between r = .52 and r = .99, for most of the categories. Since our collected data consists
of both students’ individual maps and the group map, we only evaluated effectiveness in
two dimensions: at the group level as a whole and as an interaction between individual
and group achievements. The following measures are used in this study (see Fig. 3):

e Individual-to-group transfer of shared knowledge (TSK 4g): the number of
substructures shared by both individual maps and transferred to the collaborative
map. The score was normalized with the number of shared substructures.

e Individual-to-group transfer of unshared knowledge (TUK 4 (orgy): the number of
unshared substructures in each individual map and transferred to the collaborative
map. The score was normalized with the number of unshared substructures.

e Individual-to-group transfer (TK 4g : TSK 4g U TUK, U TUKg): the total number of
transferred substructures from individual maps to the collaborative map. The score
was normalized with the number of shared and unshared substructures.

e Lost knowledge (LK 4g: UK, U IKpg) \ TK 4g): the number of individual
substructures not transferred from individual maps to the collaborative map.

e Group creativity (NK 4g): the number of new substructures in the collaborative map
that were not included in both individual maps. The score was normalized with the
number of unknown substructures.

e Group achievement (GK 4g): the number of substructures in the collaborative map.

The score was normalized with the maximum number of possible substructures.

After normalization, each score interval is between 0 and 1.

Based on the sample of knowledge distribution depicted in Table 2, substructures
(1) and (4) were the shared knowledge about the task of group 01, while substruc-
ture (3) was the unshared knowledge of student B, and substructure (2) was the
unknown substructures of group 01 (ignorance). During collaboration, the students
wrote substructures (1) to (3) correctly, so we regarded those substructures as group
knowledge. Specifically, substructure (1) was considered as the individual-to-group
transfer of shared knowledge, substructure (2) was categorized as new knowledge,
and substructure (3) was categorized as the individual-to-group transfer of unshared

knowledge.

Learners’ affective responses

We conducted a survey to capture the experiences of learners while participating in the
experiment. The questionnaire consisted of 15 closed-ended items related to attractive-
ness, stimulation, and perspicuity subscales, which were adapted from an Indonesian-
language version of a user-experience questionnaire (Santoso et al. 2016). The students
rated the items on a Likert scale (from 1 to 7). Six open-ended questions were asked to
capture the positive and negative experiences of learners at every step of the collaborative
learning activities. All questionnaire items had been face-validated by the teacher before
distribution to the students. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were 0.74, 0.84, and 0.77 for
attractiveness, stimulation, and perspicuity subscales, respectively, showing good internal

consistency.

Results

Overall patterns of knowledge transfer

During the first phase of the experiment, 82% (m = 120) of the essential substructures
were written in the individual maps. Fifty-five percent of those written substructures
are shared knowledge (Fig. 4). As much as 92% of the shared and unshared knowledge
is also seen in the collaborative maps, the remainder becoming non-transferred (lost)
knowledge. Almost all shared knowledge is transferred to the collaborative map, while
the percentage of neglected unshared knowledge is 15% (m = 8) of total unshared knowl-
edge. Fourteen groups extended their group maps with new information (substructures)
that did not exist in the individual maps (” = 8). The amount of unknown information
(ignorance) in the collaborative maps decreased, from 18 to 13%.

Learning effectiveness at the group and interaction level

Figures 5 and 6 display the distribution of knowledge transfer and group creativity (new
substructures) among different conditions regarding prior-knowledge-equivalence and
shared knowledge on the individual concept maps. Since the data do not follow a nor-
mal distribution, only median and range values are presented in the figures. The amount

at the same level (similar median values), with differences in score distribution. The
high-knowledge-equivalence groups have quite different scores, regarding transfer of
knowledge, in comparison with the low-knowledge-equivalence groups. A similar trend
is seen in the high- and low-shared-knowledge groups, in terms of their transfer of
shared and unshared knowledge. In general, the individual-to-group transfer of knowl-
edge score in high- and low-shared-knowledge conditions exhibits the same median value
and similar distribution.

We also investigated whether individual knowledge about the task affects group ten-
dency to transfer unshared knowledge, by calculating the correlation between individual
map score and normalized score for individual unshared-knowledge transfer. Results of
the Pearson correlation indicate that there is no association between individual map score
and amount of unshared-knowledge transfer (r(22) = —.060, p = .78).

Based on the knowledge-equivalence scores, the group creativity scores in both
conditions show similar median values, though the distribution is different. The
high-knowledge-equivalence groups show more variation of group creativity score
than the low-knowledge-equivalence groups. However, the low-shared-knowledge
groups have higher new knowledge scores than high-shared-knowledge groups. The
14 groups who have new knowledge are similarly distributed in each condition
(1 = 7 each).

All collaborative map scores are in the range of 75-100 for all conditions (M = 90, SD =
7.31) and are higher than individual map scores (M = 72.2,SD = 25.5). On average,
the low-knowledge-equivalence groups received 91.17 collaborative map scores (Fig. 7).
Some samples of the collaborative maps are illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9.

Learners’ affective responses

Figure 10 presents the distribution of the affective response scores among groups with
different shared-knowledge scores. A Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test indicates that there
is a significant difference between the groups with higher similarity scores and lower
similarity scores (H(13) = 56.8,p < .001). However, these differences, though signifi-
cant, are small, which denotes that the learners in heterogeneous groups do experience
positive feelings towards the activities, albeit less positive than those of learners in homo-

geneous groups. The stimulation subscale receives the highest rating, followed by the

found that some participants in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups reported
comparable on-task difficulties concerning dissimilarities of ideas or opinions, i.e., “Diffi-
cult to read when the number of visualized differences is too many (m7 = 6),’ “It was hard
to read or understand the difference map (7 = 2),’ “It was difficult to integrate different
opinions in order to reach a (group) consensus or determine which one is the correct rep-
resentation (1 = 5), and “The use of ambiguous links makes it hard to select the most
suitable relation between two concepts (7 = 1)?

Discussion

Collaborative concept mapping using the RKB approach allows learners to represent and
manipulate individual cognitive structures and lets partners provide feedback after ini-
tial map reconstruction and difference map visualization. This activity provides an active
means to review individual maps and to elicit new information. Access to distributed
cognitive resources gained through reviewing learners’ individual maps positively influ-
enced the broadness of group solutions to problems (Stoyanova and Kommers 2002).
Consistently, our findings show that the amount of essential knowledge, which each group
should have possessed, was increasing while students took part in the activities. The pro-
cess of knowledge acquisition and creation through direct interaction had an impact on
group-learning effectiveness (Stoyanova and Kommers 2002).

RQ (a): What are the overall patterns of knowledge transfer from individual-to-group
representation?

We found that both types of knowledge (shared and unshared) were highly trans-
ferred to group solutions, with a rate of 92%. In contrast, some previous studies report
that groups often abandon unshared knowledge or resources (Fischer and Mandl 2002;
Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017). This indicates that this approach has the potential to create
awareness of others’ understanding regardless of the type of knowledge. The weak corre-
lation between individual map scores and the normalized transfer of unshared-knowledge
score demonstrates that students were able to detect important substructures without
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:13 Page 15 of 19

giving undue consideration to who was the source of information during the collaborative
phase. For instance, a student who had a lower individual map score than their partner
could transfer their unshared knowledge, while the one with the higher individual score
might unable to convey their unshared knowledge. Another implication is that the stu-
dents tended not to merely follow particular group members. They acknowledged their
partners’ perspectives and considered others’ different understandings.

RQ (b): Does similarity of knowledge affect students’ learning effectiveness in the two
dimensions (i.e., interaction of individual members and group level), and, if so, to what extent?
The amount of knowledge transfer from individual to group solutions represents learn-
ing effectiveness as an interaction of individual-to-group knowledge. The results show
that the amount of knowledge transfer was considerably high for all group conditions.
Although there are some differences regarding the scores for knowledge transfer, for both
shared and unshared knowledge, the divergence in prior knowledge or shared knowl-
edge about the task in each group did not significantly influence the median scores for
knowledge transfer (Figs. 5 and 6). The distribution of transfer scores in the homogeneous
groups has more variation than in the more heterogeneous ones. This implies that the
heterogeneous groups had a higher tendency to transfer individual knowledge into group
solutions. It is also interesting to note that some groups, that categorized as homogeneous
groups, did not transfer all of their individual shared knowledge. Further investigation of
their group processes would be needed to reveal the problems for these specific groups.

The homogeneous groups, based on their prior-knowledge equivalence, demonstrated
lower achievements than the heterogeneous groups (Fig. 7). Meanwhile, the groups that
were more homogeneous in terms of their shared knowledge achieved higher scores
than the other groups. Despite this, the map scores for groups of different composi-
tion were not significantly different. Since the knowledge-equivalence score was based
on prior knowledge, the low-equivalence groups might have broader perspectives on
some previous topics that were not directly connected to the mapping task. In con-
trast, the shared-knowledge scores were measured from the maps themselves. Therefore,
the low-shared-knowledge groups might initially attempt to resolve conflicts over cer-
tain concepts, while the high-shared-knowledge groups could focus directly on building
better maps.

RQ (c): Does similarity of knowledge affect the experiences of participants in the study, and, if
so, to what extent?

The affective responses of the groups demonstrate that learners in higher-shared-
knowledge groups are slightly more positive than those working in low-shared-knowledge
conditions. Participants under both conditions display similar patterns: they thought
that our activities were stimulating and attractive rather than perspicuous. Difficulties
appeared when they faced differences in ideas or perspectives and needed to resolve those
conflicts in order to reach a single group solution. Although pursuing conflict resolu-
tion is essential for conceptual change and advancement of knowledge in collaborative
learning (Chan et al. 1997; Roschelle 1992; van Boxtel et al. 2002), the learners responded
negatively. This might affect their motivation for participating in collaborative activities.
Further studies on how computer-based visualization can be utilized to assist learners

during conflict-oriented and integration-oriented consensus building are indispensable.

Limitations and some potential future works

Several limitations to this preliminary study need to be acknowledged. The current
study has evaluated the learning effectiveness of collaborative concept mapping activities
only in two different dimensions (i.e., the level of the group as a whole and the level of
interaction between individual and group). We have not investigated their effectiveness
at the level of individual learning since there is a lack of evidence related to individ-
ual performance after collaboration. A prior study suggests that the level of convergence
achieved during collaborative concept mapping may influence individual performance
after collaboration (Gnesdilow et al. 2010). Since the amount of knowledge transfer dur-
ing collaboration is significant, this approach has the potential to support learners in
attaining learning effectiveness at the individual level. Furthermore, an evaluation of indi-
vidual learning achievements after collaboration is necessary to get more comprehensive
understanding of its effect at the individual level.

The concept mapping activity was conducted once during 2 h class session. It is insuf-
ficient to infer the generalizability of the results, so more experimental sessions during
one term of study are strongly recommended. Further studies with a large number of par-
ticipants from different subject areas are also necessary to identify the breadth of this
approach. It would also be interesting in the future to compare the results of groups with
reciprocal teaching activity and conventional collaborative concept mapping without the
reciprocal cycle since the current study is a single group design without a comparison

group.

Conclusion

In summary, the current study finds that, following the designated activities, learners
are informed about their partner’s understanding, whether such knowledge is shared
or unshared. Furthermore, they have a greater tendency to elaborate it into group
knowledge. Groups with high and low similarity of knowledge achieved similar learn-
ing effectiveness at the level of interaction between individuals and group as whole.
Differences in group composition, based on similarity of prior knowledge or shared
knowledge about the task, does not significantly differentiate the learning effectiveness.
However, since the designated activities enabled tangible expression of individual knowl-
edge structures, the amount of joint knowledge within the group may possibly affect
group outcomes. Moreover, different opinions or perspectives on the task itself influence
learners’ overall experiences within a collaborative environment.

These findings enhance our understanding of the effect of the RKB approach for collab-
orative concept mapping across different group compositions. This investigation is also
useful to provide suggestions regarding group formation for the practitioners who intend
to apply the approach in their classroom. It also provides future direction to advance the
RKB system, for example, by designing a computer-based visualization that would help
students to resolve conflicts and reach a consensus. Though the students may acknowl-
edge dissimilar perspectives from the partner’s representation, integrating different ideas
continues to be a challenge for them.
