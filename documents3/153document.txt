1. INTRODUCTION

The vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) has been rising since the last decade due to mobile
communications of a human behavior. In the modern society, people need to commute from home to working
places in a daily basis. This commuting behavior requires a mobile communication system that facilitates
all types of communication such as sending emails and accessing real-time traffic information while
driving [1-3].

Principally, vehicular-to-vehicular (V2V) Network is a network where vehicles as moving nodes
connect to each other to share and exchange information [4, 5]. To support this, vehicles in the vehicular
network can be equipped with a visible light communication (VLC) [6, 7] device where the process of
sharing information and exchanging messages relies on the connection among vehicles using lights as
illustrated in Figure | [7].

The VLC in vehicular network (VLC-VN) is one type of wireless communications that performs
the flexibility in terms of time and spatial. In terms of time flexibility feature, VLC-VN can build
a connection at any time without concerning about the reliable internet connection. In terms of spatial
flexibility, VLC-VN can be built under any circumstances where there is no fixed internet infrastructure.
However, VLC-VN can be challenging due to several reasons, on one hand the connection can be
disconnected in a very short period as a disadvantage in terms of time, and on the other hand the effect of
obstacles such as buildings and overpass constructions can distract the wireless signal from one vehicle as
a transmitter to other vehicles as receivers [8].

The process to ensure the message transmission contains of several stages. The first stage is
a position coordinate knowledge of each vehicle as the initiation process. These position coordinates are
important to the next process: forwarding messages. In the forwarding process, a vehicle as a source mobile
node locates nearest vehicles’ position. By collecting several closest coordinates, the forwarding scheme
decides which vehicle will be the forwarder vehicle [9, 10]. There are several position-based forwarding
schemes in VLC-VN which will be discussed in the following subsections.

Vehicle-to-vehicular (V2V) forwarding schemes. A packet contains information is transmitted from
a mobile node to another mobile node. The process of transmitting is challenging since the nodes involved
are changing their position in seconds. A frequent changing position of nodes yields massive position
coordinates as a function of time. The algorithm determines a current node’s position by taking into account
a current node’s coordinates. When the current node’s coordinates which can be both sender’s and receiver’s
coordinates have tracked, the next step of the packet forwarding algorithm is to forward the packet from
the sender to the receiver. This forwarding algorithm is known as a position-based forwarding scheme [11].

The advantages of the position-based forwarding scheme as follow: (1) It has a proper destination
since it does not need to broadcast Hello messages in order to learn position of the other nodes. (2) It is
convenient for dynamic nodes, since the forwarding algorithm updates the current node’s coordinates.
(3) It reduces the memory, since it does not need a full path from a sender to a destination node.
(4) It improves the precision level in terms of three-dimensional environment i.e., longitude, latitude,
and altitude coordinates [12, 13].

The Inevitable Obstacle. There are not many works done to study the impact of obstacles that
interfere while transmitting the data in V2V researches [14, 15]. In most of V2V communication researches,
the existence of obstacles is often excluded in its simulation scenario. Our previous research concerns about
a realistic environment in a city road [16]. The city road has several types, 1.e., straight road, forked road and
road with junctions. The data transmission between two vehicles has a possibility to be distracted by
the obstacle in the road with junction or a crossroad. This distraction can be caused by high rise buildings and
road construction as illustrated in Figure 2. In addition, the obstacle indicates a non-vehicle object such as
a portal gate and a tree. The impact of the obstacle to a VLC transceiver leads to forwarding issues in
transferring data [17]. Thus, this proper forwarding scheme is required. In case of a freeway environment,
an unexpected heavy-duty vehicle such as a container truck also impacts the data transmission between
two vehicles.

This paper is structured as follows: Section | introduces the challenge of VLC-VN as the alternative
to wireless communication in VANET. Section 2 covers the proposed forwarding scheme in V2V which
applies inevitable obstacles. Section 3 describes the proposed forwarding scheme in VLC-VN with obstacle
awareness measured by an object identifier [18]. Section 4 evaluates the forwarding scheme based on real
measurement that is fed into a simulation. Finally, conclusion and future work are described in section 5.

2. VISIBLE LIGHT COMMUNICATION VEHICULAR NETWORK (VLC-VN) FORWARDING
METHOD

Visible light communication (VLC) has been applied in wide fields such as undersea [19],
and V2V communication [20, 21]. In VLC system, LED is commonly used as a light source [22] where its
basic geometry is shown in Figure 3. The reflection shows field of view denoted as (FOV) on a line-of-sight
(LOS) environment. That basic geometry of VLC leads to a transmission limitation in terms of reflection and
Non-LOS cases due to building constructions as illustrated in Figure 2. In addition, VLC transmission has
a similarity to an angle- based forwarding since it does not transmit as the other wireless transmission system
such as in WiFi. Therefore, an approach to obtain the data transmission in V2V network is derived in three
key points as discussed in the following subsections:

 

Figure 3. Basic geometry of visible light communication source, reflector and receiver [21]

2.1. Initiation

The first step of the VLC-VN algorithm is to initiate the connection to other closest vehicles by
indicating the strongest VLC signal reception. This step is done by multicasting hello-messages to potential
vehicles. The hello-message contains of coordinate position of a current vehicle, and time stamps.
This initiation system obtains replies from any contacted vehicles. Vehicles located closed to the vehicle that
multicasts the hello-message, replies with an acknowledgement-ACK, its coordinate location and time
stamps. The reply message calculation occurs in this step by generating a hello-reply list.

2.2. Obstacle awareness

The second step is where the object is identified using the camera to obtain the full dimension of
whether it is a vehicle or a non-vehicle. On one hand, when an object is identified as a vehicle, the obstacle
awareness algorithm records the coordinate position of current vehicle. These coordinate positions are stored
in a temporary table of each communicating vehicle. On the other hand, when an object is identified as
a non-vehicle, the algorithm discards any information regarding to this object. Thus, the algorithm continues

to detect other objects. This scheme is also useful for the recovery step when the data interchanging fails.
This recovery step recollects the current position coordinates of communicating vehicles and recounts
the possible obstacle.

2.3. Forwarding process

The third step is the forwarding process that consists of the forwarding decision and the forwarding
step. The forwarding decision is the process where a vehicle replies with a fastest hello-reply message is
selected as the next forwarder. The hello-reply message consists of location coordinates and time stamps
indicating transmitted and received time. The next step is called the forwarding step where the data packet is
ready to transmit based on time and distance calculations. The VLC-VN forwarding algorithm applying those
three key points is represented in Figure 4.

Figure 4. The VLC-VN forwarding algorithm

Since the VLC performs better in a line-of-sight (LOS) environment, one parameter regarding to
the signal-loss which is affected by distance or obstacles, is considered. The negative value of this parameter
indicates the non-line-of-sight (NON-LOS) situation where the obstacle is identified. In this research,
that parameter is integrated in a maximum distance of VLC transmission.

3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

Vehicles are equipped with an object detector in order to identify other vehicles. Thus, other objects
that are not identified as vehicles are discarded. In addition, the VLC transceiver is installed on each vehicle in
order to initiate the communication. The mobility of all connecting vehicles is assumed to move on the road in
high traffic density and following the freeway mobility, thus, the maximum velocity is 10-20 km/hr. The data
transmission model performs the vehicle communication. Consequently, the transmission period is short and
fast. VLC transceiver has been assembled as shown in Figure 5 to obtain the real measurement.

This VLC transceiver measurement defines the actual distance between two points, i.e., transmission
and receiver point. This transceiver is installed on each communicating vehicle. In addition, an object
identifier is installed to detect other vehicles precisely as the initial prototype of simulating V2V network.
Therefore, it performs the identification process as shown in Figure 6.

Due to the simplification of VLC transceiver prototype, the simulation is conducted based on several
parameters as shown in Table 1, using network simulator 3 (NS3) and SUMO for mobility [23-25].
The VLC transmission ranges up to 8 meters using 5 mm LED based on our experiment. The number of
vehicles range from 10 to 50 vehicles where pairs of vehicles are randomly selected as the original
transmitter and the destination. For example, in the 10-simulated vehicles, there are 5 pairs of vehicles that
communicate each other. The transfer rate is 1OOMbps indicates the maximum rate with the constant bit rate
(CBR) data rate type. The simulation takes 300 s in a 500x500 meter square in a freeway environment, thus,
the speed range up to maximum 50 km/h in a high dense traffic. Finally, we apply the Greedy [26-28] based
with VLC-VN forwarding scheme and run the simulation for 10 times.

3.2. Evaluation of VLC-VN packet forwarding

The first evaluation based on the parameter setting is the receiving hello-message packet, i.e.,
20 byte. This hello-message is multicates to every mobile node that located in VLC’s transmission range for
300 seconds. The number of received hello packets on respected mobile nodes shows the achievable of other
mobile nodes that can connect to the source mobile node. As shown in Figure 7, it is practically reasonable to
evaluate with the bigger packet size since 98% packets are received out of total 40 packets transmitted.

The second results of simulation show the size of data packet evaluation. The constant data rate of
100 Mbps is transferred from one mobile node to another mobile node. The number of mobile nodes range
from 10 to 50 nodes. This data throughput ranges from 2 to 3.8% on average as shown in Figure 8.
These data throughputs in all data packet transmissions 1.e., 500B, IKB and 2KB are below 5% due to
the frequent connection changing between mobile nodes. This frequent connection changing leads to short
duration of connection. The size of data packet does not have a significant impact to data throughput in
overall simulation. In addition, the data throughputs in each simulation increase from 2.28 to 3.65% when
the number of mobile node increases. This increment occurs due to the increased number of connections
between mobile nodes. However, the highest amount of data throughput is achieved by transmitting
500 bytes of data and involving 40 mobile nodes. This can be concluded that the 500x500 simulation area is
compatible for communicating the 40 mobile nodes which are running in maximum speed of 20 km/hr.

The third results of simulation show the transmission delay in all data packet transmissions
i.e. 500B, 1KB, and 2KB is shown in Figure 9. Although the low data throughput is considered as
a drawback, however, the transmission delay shows the expected end-to-end delay 1.e., lower than 4 seconds,
when the numbers of mobile nodes reach 40 vehicles. When there are 30 mobile nodes transmitting,
the end-to-end delay reaches below 1 second. The transmission delay increases up to 15 seconds when
transmitting 2KB of data.

4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This research performed the feasibility of VLC in V2V communication by applying the VLC-VN
algorithm. The VLC-VN algorithm was designed to overcome the inevitable obstacle, fast and short
communication between vehicles, and the VLC compatibility in a vehicular network. The results showed
the low transmission delay, 1.e., less than 1 second. Thus, the VLC-VN forwarding scheme can be considered
as a real time data transmission in the freeway environment. As a drawback, only 3% of possible transmitting
data packet in the freeway environment which is mostly caused by non-vehicle detected objects and the short
transmission duration. To conclude, VLC-VN is suitable on the data transmission when the scenario is in
a platooning one and in a point-to-point communication. Based on the result, the future work of VLC-VN
communication will be developed by simulating a Road-side Units (RSU) as a static transceiver in order to
extend the transmission duration and to avoid the impact of unexpected obstacles. In addition, the RSU is
usually available on the side of every main road in a city environment, thus it can be useful not only as
the traffic light, but also as the data transmitter.
