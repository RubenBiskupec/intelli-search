Abstract

An extension of the baseline non-intrusive load monitoring approach for energy disaggregation using temporal
contextual information is presented in this paper. In detail, the proposed approach uses a two-stage disaggregation
methodology with appliance-specific temporal contextual information in order to capture time-varying power
consumption patterns in low-frequency datasets. The proposed methodology was evaluated using datasets of
different sampling frequency, number and type of appliances. When employing appliance-specific temporal

contextual information, an improvement of 1.5% up to 7.3% was observed. With the two-stage disaggregation
architecture and using appliance-specific temporal contextual information, the overall energy disaggregation
accuracy was further improved across all evaluated datasets with the maximum observed improvement, in terms of
absolute increase of accuracy, being equal to 6.8%, thus resulting in a maximum total energy disaggregation
accuracy improvement equal to 10.0%.

1 Introduction

In the last decades, rising energy consumption needs within
residential and industrial environments have become a cru-
cial issue with nowadays consumer households accounting
for approximately 40% of the total worldwide consumed
energy [1, 2]. With the development of information and
communication technologies (ICT) and the increasing
usage of electrical appliances and automation of tasks, the
electric power needs will grow further and the number of
electrical appliances per household will significantly in-
crease within the next 20 years [1, 2]. Despite the expected
increase in total energy consumption, studies estimate that
20% of households’ consumed energy could be saved by
changing consumers’ behaviour and improving the existing
poor operational strategies [3, 4]. Furthermore, the estab-
lishment of smart grids and demand management as well
as the fluctuation of power generation due to an increasing
percentage of renewable energies are enhancing the issue of

increasing energy needs [5, 6]. These changes in energy de-
mand and generation are challenging for network operators
and power generation facilities, since power needs are be-
coming less stable and unpredictable while rising at the
same time [7, 8]. To address those challenges, accurate and
fine-grained monitoring of electrical energy consumption
within residential environments is needed [2, 9] as well as
proper demand management [10]. However, nowadays, en-
ergy monitoring is mostly done via an aggregated measure
of energy consumption in the form of monthly bills and
therefore does not address the above-mentioned issues.

To measure energy consumption, smart meters are
used. A smart meter, also referred to as a smart plug, is a
device used to measure electrical power/energy consump-
tion with resolution in the order of seconds to minutes.
Smart meters measure the voltage drop over the device/
circuit and the current flowing through the device/circuit
with an arbitrary sampling frequency f,, which usually var-
ies from 1/60 Hz to 30 kHz [11]. Higher sampling fre-
quencies are usually preferred, since they contain more
detailed information about the energy consumption; how-
ever, they increase linearly the amount of acquired data

and exponentially the cost of hardware [12]. With the
sampling rate in the order of seconds, data handling for
several months/years becomes feasible and hardware costs
are relatively low. However, with the ability to provide real-
time information through smart metering and determining
detailed household energy consumption, consumer privacy
concerns are arising and energy data protection becomes
prominent [7, 13]. To address these issues, energy monitor-
ing must be carried out cost-effectively and under the con-
sideration of privacy concerns.

According to [14], the largest improvements in terms of
energy savings can be made when monitoring energy con-
sumption on a device level to detect faulty device oper-
ation and inefficient or suboptimal operational strategies.
To measure energy consumption on a device level, energy
has to be measured either for each device separately using
one sensor per device or the aggregated energy (combined
energy of several devices measured at one central point,
e.g. the power inlet of a household) has to be disaggre-
gated into a device level using computational algorithms.
When only using one sensor to disaggregate the total con-
sumed energy and extract energy consumption on the ap-
pliance level, the task is referred to as non-intrusive load
monitoring (NILM) as introduced in [15]. NILM formu-
lates the energy disaggregation problem as a single-
channel source separation problem, where the smart
meter is the only input channel measuring the total power
consumption, and the goal is to find the inverse of the ag-
gregation function to calculate consumption per device.
Comparing with intrusive load monitoring (ILM), NILM
has the advantage of requiring less hardware (ILM uses
one smart meter per device) as well as meets consumers’
acceptability with respect to privacy conserving [7, 13].

In general, NILM assumes that there is a single observa-
tion (smart meter measurements) and multiple unknowns
(electrical devices) making the disaggregation problem
highly under-determined and difficult to solve without
any further constraints. Therefore, several approaches for
disaggregation have been proposed, which can be briefly
split into methods with and without source separation
(SS). Approaches without SS are based on the decompos-
ition of the aggregated signal to a sequence of feature vec-
tors, which will be classified to device labels by a machine
learning (ML) algorithm (e.g. artificial neural networks
(ANN) [16], decision trees (DT) [17], hidden Markov
models (HMM) [18], K-nearest neighbours (KNN) [19],
support vector machines (SVM) [20]), or by a pre-defined
set of rules and thresholds [21, 22]. Furthermore, recent
research in deep learning and big data has led to a signifi-
cant increase of use of data-driven approaches using
large-scale datasets (e.g. AMPd [23]). Approaches based
on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [24—26], recur-
rent neural networks (RNNs) [27, 28] and long short-time
memories (LSTMs) [27, 29] have been proposed in the

literature, while denoising autoencoders (dAEs) [30] and
gate recurrent units (GRUs) [26] have also been used. Ap-
proaches with SS are based on single-channel source separ-
ation algorithms (e.g. non-negative matrix factorization [31],
sparse component analysis [32]) to extract the consumption
of each device from the aggregated signal by using additional
constraints (e.g. sparseness or sum-to-one [33]) during the
optimization procedure. The features extracted from the ag-
gregated signal in approaches with and without SS strongly
depend on the sampling frequency, with either macroscopic
(for low sampling frequency) or microscopic (for high sam-
pling frequency) features being extracted. Macroscopic fea-
tures are mainly active and reactive power, while statistical
values from the active or reactive power (e.g. mean, median,
variance or energy) can be estimated as well [34]. Micro-
scopic features can be current harmonics or transient en-
ergy [21, 35] and require high-sampling frequency to be
calculated (1 kHz and above).

Several NILM approaches with and without SS have been
proposed in the literature. In these approaches, one- or multi-
state electrical devices have been modelled by finite-state ma-
chines, i.e. with steady energy consumption behaviour per
operational state [15]. In contrast to one/multi-state devices,
there is no established approach in detecting appliances with
continuous power consumption or with non-linear behaviour
and highly varying power signature [36, 37]. Researchers have
addressed this issue by using high-frequency features or wave-
lets to detect transient device behaviour, which however have
the drawback of higher cost in hardware and increased com-
putational power needed [12, 37, 38]. Therefore, most ap-
proaches use disaggregation algorithms with sampling rates
in the order of seconds to minutes, in addition to temporal
information (e.g. factorial hidden Markov models (FHMM)
[18, 39]) to identify appliances with varying power consump-
tion [12, 40]. Furthermore, special filtering techniques (eg.
Kalman filters [41]) with time-varying coefficients and prob-
abilistic approaches using appliance grouping [42] have been
proposed to address the issue of modelling devices with con-
tinuous or non-linear characteristics.

In this paper, we propose the integration of temporal con-
textual information for each electrical appliance in the form
of concatenation of adjacent feature vectors within a device-
dependent time window to improve device detection per-
formance in NILM. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows: in Section 2, the proposed NILM approach using
temporal contextual information per device is presented. In
Section 3, the experimental set-up is described, and in Sec-
tion 4, the evaluation results are presented. Finally, the paper
is concluded in Section 5.

2.1 Baseline NILM architecture

As a baseline NILM approach, we consider a data-driven
energy disaggregation methodology without the use of SS
techniques, adopted in several publications found in the
literature [39, 43-46]. The baseline NILM consists of pre-
processing of the aggregated signal P.g., then decompos-
ition of the sequence of frames to a sequence of feature
vectors followed by processing from a classification/re-
gression algorithm using pre-trained appliances’ models to
determine device operation as shown in Fig. 1.

During the pre-processing step, filtering and/or down-
sampling is performed, and then the signal is frame
blocked. Framing can be done either with constant or
with variable frame length [35, 47]. In the state-based
baseline NILM approach, in order to estimate the device
consumption on a state level, a regression algorithm in-
stead of a classification algorithm is used [48, 49], while

classification is used in event-based approaches to detect
devices’ on/off states [39, 45, 46].

2.2 Proposed NILM architecture

The proposed methodology uses a two-stage disaggrega-
tion scheme, with the first stage performing power con-
sumption estimation for each device by extending the
baseline NILM architecture to using temporal contextual
information (TCI) and the second stage fusing the esti-
mation results of each device using a regression model.
The block diagram of the proposed two-stage NILM
architecture using TCI is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Similarly to the baseline NILM, the aggregated power con-
sumption signal P,., is initially pre-processed, and a feature
vector v, v,€ R” is extracted for every frame h, with 1<t<
T, where T is the total number of frames. During stage 1, the
feature vectors are expanded to C,,, using their N adjacent
ones, thus creating a temporal contextual window w of
length equal to w= 2N + 1 concatenated frames, ie.:

Cm, = TCI n (vi, wr.)

— ve am ee Mp, vein, (3)

where TCI,, is the temporal contextual information
expansion function for the m-th device and C,,, is the
expansion for the m-th device and the ¢t-th frame. The
TCI expansion is performed separately for each device
m using its optimal temporal contextual information
Wopt = {Woot} » With Wop being calculated offline on a
bootstrap training dataset. The expanded feature vector
Cy, of each device m is then processed by a regression

model f{), and the output of stage 1, Poy is an initial esti-
mation of the power consumption of each device:

Pm = f (Cm) (4)

The power consumption estimations, P ¢R™ of the M de-
vices from stage 1, are used together with the feature vector,

consumptions of the M devices. In detail, in the second stage
M regression, models are receiving as input the power con-

sumption estimates P from stage 1 and the initial feature

vector v, The use of the device estimates P allows the
second-stage regression model estimators to model power
consumption correlations between different devices. In both
stages 1 and 2, the regression models of the M devices oper-
ate in parallel and separately for each device. The proposed
methodology combines the integration of temporal context-
ual information with the device-specific operation of each of
the M appliances, thus capturing temporal information indi-
vidually for each appliance and learning it by the regression
model.

3 Experimental set-up

The proposed two-stage NILM architecture with the
device-dependent temporal contextual information pre-
sented in Section 2 was evaluated using a number of
publicly available datasets and a deep learning algorithm
for regression. The datasets and parameters set for deep
learning regression are presented below.

3.1 Databases

Three different publicly available databases were used,
namely the ECO [50], the REDD [51], and the iAWE
[52] database. The ECO and REDD databases consist of
different datasets with each of them containing power
consumption recordings from different houses, while
iAWE database consists of recordings from one house.
The evaluated datasets are tabulated in Table 1 with the
number of appliances denoted in column ‘#App’. In the
same column, the number of appliances in brackets is
the number of appliances after excluding devices with

power consumption below 25 W (italic entries), which
were added to the power of the ‘ghost device’, similarly
to the experimental set-up followed in [53, 54]. The next
three columns in Table 1 are tabulating the sampling
period T;, the duration T and the appliance types of each
evaluated dataset.

The appliances’ type categorization is based on their
operation as described in [55, 56], ie. one-state devices
have only on/off status (e.g. resistive lamps, kettles, or
fridges without significant power spikes), multi-state de-
vices have several discrete power consumption states
(e.g. washing machines including different washing cy-
cles), non-linear loads (e.g. electronics) and devices with
continuous power consumption signature, which are
controlled by power electronics (e.g. air condition) and
usually have an exponential decay pattern. In all appli-
ance types, a peak might appear at the beginning of their
signature, e.g. in refrigerators. Characteristic examples of
the power consumption signatures of each of the four
appliance types are illustrated in Fig. 3. The ECO-3 and
REDD-5 datasets were excluded as ECO-3 contains only
the aggregated signal and not the power consumptions
per device; thus, there is no ground truth to evaluate
NILM approaches [50], and REDD-5 has significantly
short-monitoring duration [57]. Regarding the size of
the evaluated data, the whole REDD database was used
(ignoring the gaps in the measurements as in [58]), while
1 week of data was chosen for the ECO and iAWE data-
bases to have similar amounts of training samples as in
the REDD dataset. In detail, the week from 5 July until
11 July 2012 was selected from the ECO database while
the week from 8 June until 14 June was selected for the
iAWE database, respectively. These particular weeks
were selected in order as many as possible devices to ap-
pear in the aggregated signal, and since in previous

papers using the ECO and iAWE databases [44, 50], the
time interval used has not been reported.

In Table 2, the appliances from each dataset are cate-
gorized according to the four different appliance types
mentioned above. The categorization is done with re-
spect to the electrical properties of the appliances and
their corresponding power consumption signatures. In
addition, the percentage of the total energy per appliance
type in each dataset is given. The ID number of appli-
ances (columns ‘App’) corresponds to the appliances of
each dataset as denoted in Table 2.

As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, the number of appli-
ances as well as the appliance type in the evaluated data-
sets is varying. In particular, the number of appliances
varies from 6 (ECO-1) to 18 (REDD-3) while the number
of appliance types varies from 2 (REDD-2) to 4 (REDD-
4/6); thus, the 11 evaluated datasets include different
device combinations and characteristics, which are rep-
resentative of modern households. Common in all data-
sets is their relatively low sampling period (1-3 s) and
the consideration of active power samplings only, result-
ing to computational simplicity and runtime advantages

[59]. Furthermore, all three databases were recorded
within the last decade meaning that the households used
were equipped with recent device technology [50, 51].

In our experimental set-up, the real aggregated signal
(which includes ghost power from unknown devices) was
used to evaluate the performance of the proposed NILM
methodology, thus making the experimental set-up identi-
cal to real-life conditions. Specifically, the input aggregated
power consumption signal we used was the originally mea-
sured by the smart meter (one sensor only) during data ac-
quisition (similarly to [60]) and not an artificially generated
aggregated signal created by adding the power consump-
tion signals from a manually selected closed set of devices
(synthesized data), as in [29, 61-63], which was criticized in
[64] for not corresponding to real-world conditions.

3.2 Pre-processing and feature extraction

During pre-processing, the aggregated signal was frame
blocked in frames of ten samples with overlap between
successive frames equal to 50% (i.e. five samples). For
every frame, a feature vector consisting of the mean,
root mean square, standard deviation and peak to root
mean square value was calculated, similarly to [65],
resulting to feature vectors of dimensionality equal to
four. In detail, the mean value is used as the most gen-
eral information about the energy consumption in each
frame, while the root mean square value is used as a fil-
tered version of the mean value smoothing outliers and
small changes (noise) in the power consumption signal
[65]. Moreover, the standard deviation is used in order
to capture sudden changes of the power signal within a
frame, i.e. changes of device states, while the peak to
root mean square value is selected to capture the max-
imum change in power normalized to the root mean
square value of the frame in order to have a quantitative
measure of change in power within each frame [65]. In
order to consider temporal contextual information, ex-
panded feature vectors were extracted by concatenating
to each feature vector, the N preceding and the WN suc-
ceeding vectors as described in Section 2.

For the regression models of stage 1, feed-forward deep
neural networks (DNNs) were used. In detail, the DNN
consisted of 3 hidden layers with 32 sigmoid nodes per
layer. The number of layers and nodes was empirically se-
lected after evaluation on a bootstrap training subset with
artificially generated aggregated data (removed ghost
power) as shown in Table 3. A ‘one vs. all’ regression ap-
proach was followed; thus, the output layer consisted of
one regression node only predicting the power of the m-th
appliance. In order to avoid overlap between training and
test data, each of the evaluated datasets was equally split
into two subsets, one for training the DNN models and
one for evaluating the proposed architecture.

The architecture presented in Section 2 was evaluated
according to the experimental set-up described in Sec-
tion 3. The performance was evaluated in terms of esti-
mation accuracy (Eacc), aS proposed in [51], taking into
account the estimated power p,, where T is the number
of disaggregated frames and M is the number of disag-
gregated devices including the ghost power, i.e.:

For evaluating the estimation accuracy on the device
level, Eq. 5 was modified and the summation over M ap-
pliances was eliminated resulting in Eq. 6

The NILM architecture with temporal contextual in-
formation (TCI) was tested for a set of temporal con-
textual windows of different length. The experimental
results of the TCI architecture (i.e. the output of stage 1
in Fig. 2) for different temporal contextual window
lengths w, with the same w for all devices and 1< N<6,
are shown in Table 4. The best performing length of the
temporal contextual window w for each of the evaluated
datasets is indicated in italics. In the first column (w=
1), the performance without TCI is given. In the last col-
umMN (Wopt), the estimation accuracy Eacc when using
the optimal temporal contextual window separately for
each device is shown.

As can be seen in Table 4, the use of TCI improves
energy disaggregation performance when compared with
the baseline NILM system (w=1) across all evaluated
datasets. In the case of using a temporal contextual win-
dow of the same length for all devices, i.e. w=3 up to
w = 13, the best performing set-up varies from w=5 to
w=11. In general, the datasets with optimal w in low
lengths (w<5) mostly have one/multi-state types of de-
vices, while datasets with higher optimal TCI lengths
(w>9) are dominated by devices of non-linear/continu-
ous type. The NILM performance using TCI is further
improved when the optimal temporal contextual window

length per device is used (Wop). Specifically, the use of
an optimized w value for each device instead of a flat
value for all devices improves the performance from 0.5
(REDD-4) up to 2.2% (ECO-2/REDD-1), in terms of ab-
solute improvement. The use of device-dependent TCI
was found to improve the performance across all evalu-
ated datasets and especially in the datasets with approxi-
mately equal energy consumption distribution of the
appliances types, like datasets ECO-2 and REDD-1.

Next, we evaluated the performance of the two-stage
methodology presented in Section 2. The evaluation re-
sults of the proposed NILM architecture are shown in
Table 5. For the purpose of direct comparison of the
two-stage architecture with the TCI approach (stage 1),
the same training and test subset division was used in all
evaluated datasets. The best achieved performance of

the TCI approach for each of the evaluated datasets
shown in Table 4 is repeated in Table 5 as well.

As can be seen in Table 5, the proposed two-stage
methodology outperforms the TCI NILM architecture
(stage 1) in all evaluated datasets. In detail, the highest
performance improvement (when considering temporal
contextual window of the same length for all devices) in
terms of Excc values was observed in the REDD-3 dataset
(+ 5.2% for w= 5) followed by the REDD-2/ECO-5 dataset
(+ 3.0%, for w=5), while the lowest improvement was
found in the REDD-6 dataset (+ 0.1%, for w=3), when
compared with the TCI NILM. Moreover, the best energy
disaggregation performance for 10 out of 11 datasets was
observed for temporal contextual window lengths between
3<w<11 with the majority of the datasets having an opti-
mal temporal contextual window length between 5<w<
9. In the case of the ECO database (with only 6—9 appli-
ances per dataset), the two-stage NILM methodology
offered an improvement of 0.5—3.0% in terms of Eacc,
while the REDD database (with 10-18 appliances per
dataset) offered an improvement of 0.1—5.2%. When con-
sidering the optimal temporal contextual window length per
device (column ‘wo,’ in Table 5), the energy disaggregation
improvement offered by the two-stage NILM architecture is
even higher. In particular, the highest performance
improvement was observed in ECO-2 and ECO-4 datasets
(+ 5.2% and + 3.0%, respectively), while the lowest improve-
ment was observed in ECO-5 dataset (+ 0.1%), when com-
pared with the TCI NILM. When compared with the
baseline NILM, the highest performance improvement is +
10.0% (iAWE) and the lowest one is + 2.0% (ECO-6).

To further compare the results with the NILM
methods proposed in the literature, the very recent work
of [66] was used, which includes a summary of NILM
performances for the REDD database for different set-
ups. Approaches using the most popular experimental

set-up using houses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 with all devices and
measuring performance using the Excc metric were con-
sidered. Moreover, the results from [66] were extended
by including recently published results [67, 68] on the
same experimental set-up. It is worth mentioning that al-
though the same data and the same accuracy metric was
used, direct comparison is not assured as data splits or pre-
processing might vary between the compared approaches
(such information is not provided in most papers found in
the bibliography). The results are tabulated in Table 6.

As can be seen in Table 6, the proposed fusion method-
ology outperforms all other reported approaches on the
REDD-1/2/3/4/6 dataset set-up. In detail, the proposed ap-
proach outperforms the Powerlets approach [67] by 4.3%,
while it performs 1.7% better than supervised GSP pro-
posed in [68]. However, it must be noted that the approach
in [68] uses a reduced number of appliances and thus can-
not be directly compared with the other NILM approaches.

Analysis of the proposed two-stage NILM methodology
on a device level was performed. In Table 7, the energy dis-
ageregation improvement in terms of absolute increase of
device estimation accuracy (Ek¢¢) and the corresponding
optimal temporal contextual window length per device, re-
spectively are presented. The first column in Table 7 denotes
the type of each appliance as defined in Tables 1 and 2.

As can be seen in Table 7, appliances belonging to type A
(ie. single- or multi-state appliances with their power con-
sumption signature not varying in time, like air exhaust, dis-
posal, electric heat, iron, lamp) are not significantly benefiting
by the two-stage NILM methodology with temporal context-
ual information since the energy disaggregation improvement
for type A devices ranges between 0.0 and 3.4% with an aver-
age improvement of 1.6%. Type B appliances (ie. devices
without strong temporal behaviour but with significant peak
power at the beginning of their power signature, like

dishwasher, freezer, fridge, washer-dryer) were found to
benefit from the proposed methodology with the energy dis-
ageregation improvement for type B appliances ranging be-
tween 0.4 and 17.8% with an average improvement of 8.6%.
In the case of non-linear appliances (appliances type C, e.g.
electronic devices, entertainment, laptops), the power signa-
ture is usually strongly varying with time and the temporal
contextual information can capture well their dynamic char-
acteristics, with the energy disaggregation improvement for
type C appliances ranging between 0.2 and 12.7% with an
average improvement of 3.8%. As regards continuous devices
(appliances type D, like air-conditioner and water motor),
their power signature appears in the form of an exponential
rise or decay including significant power peaks at the onset
of their signature. Due to their slowly but strongly time-
varying behaviour, their amplitude variation can be captured
by temporal contextual information and misclassification
with multi-state appliances of the similar consumption ampli-
tude levels can be reduced, with the energy disaggregation
improvement for type D devices ranging between 1.4 and
44.7% with an average improvement of 28.6%. The effect of
the two-stage temporal contextual information NILM meth-
odology proposed in Section 2 on each of the four appliance
types is summarized in Table 8.

As can be seen in Table 8, the energy disaggregation per-
formance in type D devices improves by almost 30%,
followed by type B benefiting by almost 10%. Also, the aver-
age optimal temporal contextual window length for appli-
ance types D and B is w=9.00 and w=7.38, respectively.
For the case of non-linear appliances (type C), the perform-
ance improvement is almost 4%; however, the average opti-
mal window length is greater than the one of type B, which
is most probably owed to the longer duration of patterns as
well as the non-repetitive micropatterns within non-linear
appliances. Furthermore, the two-stage architecture im-
proves the detection of continuous or non-linear appliances
as they can be highly related to the daily routine of the
users/consumers or even be related/dependent to each
other as for example, in the case of TV and entertainment
appliances which are usually interconnected. For such de-
vices, with inter-device dependencies or daily routine pat-
terns, the a priori knowledge of the power consumption of
other devices they operate together with or devices with
similar daily routine (i.e. usually operating or not operating
simultaneously) can be beneficial for the estimation of their
power consumption. Such devices can benefit from the fu-
sion stage of the proposed architecture in which estimates
of the power consumption of the other appliances (calcu-
lated from the first stage) are used as input. Except this, de-
tection of devices with power spikes, ie. peaks that appear
during the switching on of electrical motors, e.g. in fridges
or freezers, was found to benefit from the fusion stage of
the proposed methodology, since the presence of a power
spike within a frame affects the distribution of energy

5 Conclusion

A two-stage methodology for energy disaggregation using
temporal contextual information was presented. The meth-
odology extends the baseline non-intrusive load monitoring
(NILM) approach by employing a two-stage disaggregation
and using a temporal expansion of the feature vectors
within a time window of variable length. The proposed
methodology was evaluated using the real-aggregated signal
as measured by the smart meter across various datasets of
different sampling frequency, number, and types of appli-
ances, demonstrating improvement of performance across
all datasets. The maximum improvement in terms of abso-
lute increase of accuracy was equal to 10.0% when using
appliance-driven temporal contextual information lengths
and two-stage disaggregation. In detail, the most significant
improvements were observed for devices with power peaks
and exponential decay power consumption signatures such
as refrigerators and air conditions. Moreover, improve-
ments in energy disaggregation performance were observed
for appliances with strong time-varying power signatures
like electronic devices, e.g. stereos, laptops or entertainment
electronics. With the use of the fusion stage inter-device
dependencies or daily routine patterns can be modelled
and power spikes can be found, thus resulting in further
improvement of the disaggregation accuracy.
