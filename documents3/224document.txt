Abstract

Cardiac growth is an important mechanism for the human body to respond to changes in blood flow demand. Being able
to predict the development of chronic growth is clinically relevant, but so far models to predict growth have not reached
consensus on the stimulus—effect relation. In a previously published study, we modeled cardiac and hemodynamic function
through a lumped parameter approach. We evaluated cardiac growth in response to valve disease using various stimulus—effect
relations and observed an unphysiological decline pump function. Here we extend that model with a model of hemodynamic
feedback that maintains mean arterial pressure and cardiac output through adaptation of peripheral resistance and circulatory
unstressed volume. With the combined model, we obtain stable growth and restoration of pump function for most growth
laws. We conclude that a mixed combination of stress and strain stimuli to drive cardiac growth is most promising since it
(1) reproduces clinical observations on cardiac growth well, (2) requires only a small, clinically realistic adaptation of the
properties of the circulatory system and (3) is robust in the sense that results were fairly insensitive to the exact choice of
the chosen mechanics loading measure. This finding may be used to guide the choice of growth laws in more complex finite
element models of cardiac growth, suitable for predicting the response to spatially varying changes in tissue load. Eventu-
ally, the current model may form a basis for a tool to predict patient-specific growth in response to spatially homogeneous
changes in tissue load, since it is computationally inexpensive.

The capability of the human body to maintain an adequate
level of oxygen delivery to the organs is fundamental for sur-
vival. The body can rely on several complex mechanisms to
achieve this goal. Cardiac growth is the main mechanism of
response to chronic changes in blood flow demand, induced
for example in the growing body. An in depth review of the
cardiovascular adaptations from fetus to adolescence can
be found in Dallaire and Sarkola (2018). Cardiac growth,
although essential, can evolve into a maladaptive process if

ease capable of altering either the preload or afterload of the
cardiovascular system, like for instance any valve disease,
can promote an abnormal type of growth. Left ventricular
hypertrophy has been related to an adverse prognosis dur-
ing long-term follow-ups, increasing the chance of mortal-
ity (Gosse 2005; Muiesan et al. 2004; Pierdomenico et al.
2011; Selmeryd et al. 2014; Spirito et al. 2000; Tuseth et al.
2010). Moreover, although cardiac growth phenotypes are
well characterized (Dweck et al. 2012; Ganau et al. 1992;
Rodrigues et al. 2016), the relation between the growth stim-
ulus and the long-term effects on the cardiovascular system
is still not completely clear. Being able to predict changes
in left ventricular size and shape not only will increase the
knowledge on cardiac growth, but it might also help patient
prognosis and guide the treatment of choice.

So far several models of cardiac growth (Arts et al.
2005; Goktepe et al. 2010; Humphrey and Rajagopal 2002;

Kerckhoffs et al. 2012b; Kroon et al. 2009; Lin and Taber
1995; Taber 1998) have been proposed, along with reviews
on the state of the art (Bovendeerd 2012; Witzenburg and
Holmes 2017); however, the nature of the growth stimulus
is still under debate. In a recent paper (Rondanina and Bov-
endeerd 2020), we studied growth of the left ventricle (LV)
using a simple multiscale model. We designed a growth law
capable of coupling changes in tissue mechanical load, iden-
tified as growth stimuli, into a volumetric change, expressed
by LV wall and cavity volume. We explored several choices
and combinations of growth stimuli, both stress based and
strain based, with the aim to investigate the stimulus—effect
relation. We investigated growth in response to three cases
of valve disease, aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation
(AR) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Although we were
able to achieve stable end growth states, in most cases we
obtained a drastic decrease in cardiac output (CO) and mean
arterial pressure (MAP) between 20 and 40%. Even though
valve pathologies might decrease cardiac function (Good-
man et al. 1974; Kamperidis et al. 2015), there is evidence
that mean arterial pressure and cardiac output can be main-
tained at a normal level (Cowley Jr 1992; Guyton 1967; Kai-
numa et al. 2011; Lorsomradee et al. 2007). If we accept as
healthy a cardiac index of about 2.9 1/min/m? (Ganau et al.
1992; Huang et al. 2011; Wisenbaugh et al. 1984) anda
MAP of 100 mmHg (Remmen et al. 2005; Rongen et al.
1995), these values are often within the reported ranges for
patients having AS (Lloyd et al. 2017; Rajani et al. 2010),
AR (Greenberg et al. 1981; R6thlisberger et al. 1993) or
MR (Kainuma et al. 2011). However, some studies report a
clear decrease in the hemodynamic function (Goodman et al.
1974; Kamperidis et al. 2015; Martinez et al. 2012; Wisen-
baugh et al. 1984). This might be caused by an incomplete
hemodynamic feedback or by the incapability of the body
to cope the disease severity.

In this study, we aim to extend our previous model of car-
diac growth with a hemodynamic feedback mechanism which
acts upon the circulatory system in order to restore homeo-
static levels of pressure and flow. Such mechanisms are known
to act on the short term and the long term (Dampney et al.
2002; Hall 2015). Short-term regulation includes feedback
processes which can be triggered rapidly, with baroreceptors
(Kirchheim 1976), chemoreceptors (Guyenet and Koshiya
1995) and humoral responses (Goodwin et al. 1972; Hilton
1975). The baroreflex feedback is an important short-term
mechanism, through which cardiac properties (contractil-
ity, heart rate) and vascular properties (peripheral resistance,
venous tone) are adapted to maintain mean arterial pressure
(Folkow 1978; Guyton 1981; Secomb and Pries 2011). Fluid
exchange between the vascular and interstitial space, driven
by hemodynamic and osmotic pressure, in combination with
neurohumoral control of renal function is known to control
vascular volume on the time scale of hours to days. On an even

longer timescale, cardiac adaptation in terms of contractility is
taken over by growth, while heart rate remains normal (Akin-
boboye et al. 2004; Ganau et al. 1992; Seldrum et al. 2018).
Vascular adaptation is realized through persistent changes in
stressed blood volume and systemic vascular resistance (Cow-
ley Jr 1992; Guyton 1981; Jacobsohn et al. 1997; Secomb and
Pries 2011).

In line with the approach in our previous work (Rondanina
and Bovendeerd 2020), we aim for a phenomenological
description of the cardiovascular system adaptations on the
long term. We follow previous studies which suggest how
vasculature resistance and blood volume can be adapted to
regulate the mean arterial pressure (MAP) (Cowley Jr 1992;
Guyton 1981; Osborn 2005) and cardiac output (CO) (Guyton
et al. 1955; Jacobsohn et al. 1997). CO is an important deter-
minant of the amount of oxygen supplied to the vital organs,
while the MAP is the driving force behind CO. Our model
aims to recover the CO by updating the afterload of the system,
represented by the systemic resistance, while MAP is restored
with a change in the preload, described by the stressed blood
volume.

The scope of this study is to reevaluate the relation between
a growth stimulus and its effects at organ and tissue levels in
the presence of the hemodynamic feedback. As in our previous
study, we test the model in case of three valve diseases: AS,
AR and MR. We evaluate the obtained growth in terms of the
left ventricular end diastolic volume index (EDVI), left ven-
tricular mass index (MI) and relative wall thickness (RWT).

2 Methods

In this work, we extend the approach proposed in Rondanina
and Bovendeerd (2020). More specifically, we extend the
three submodels for left ventricular (LV) mechanics, sys-
temic circulation and cardiac growth with a fourth submodel
for hemodynamic feedback.

2.1 Left ventricular mechanics model

To describe left ventricular mechanics, we use the one-fiber
model (Arts et al. 1991; Bovendeerd et al. 2006) which cou-
ples the mechanics at the organ level, identified by left ven-
tricular cavity pressure p,,,,and cavity volume V,,,,, with the

mechanics at tissue level, described with myofiber stress o,
and sarcomere length /..

sents the unstressed cavity volume, V,,,, represents the wall
volume and A; is the fiber stretch ratio. Myofiber stress o;
consists of an active component, which depends on /, and
the time elapsed after activation, and a passive component,
which depends on A,. A full description of the model can
be found in Bovendeerd et al. (2006) and Rondanina and

Bovendeerd (2020).
2.2 Systemic circulation model

The systemic circulation is described by a lumped parameter
model (Fig. 1) which interacts with the LV mechanics model.
The arteries (A) and the veins (V) are modeled by a resistance
R, a capacitor C and an inertance L in series while the periph-
eral vessels are approximated by only one resistance. The pres-
sure drop Ap over each resistance, capacitor and inertance is
defined as follows:

Apr = Rap (2a)
Vo-Veo

A = —— 2b

Po C (2b)
dq;

A = |_— 2

PL di (2c)

where g is the flow through each segment (R, and L) while

V- and V( are the stressed and unstressed volumes that a
vessel can accommodate. According to Eqs. 2a and 2c, we
can write the arterial flow q, as:

dn
dt

Pry — Pa = Kay Rada + La (3)

and the venous flow qy as:

Py — Pw = kv Rv dy + Ly
where py, is the LV cavity pressure, p, and py, are the arte-
rial and venous pressure, R, and Ry are the arterial and
venous resistance, and L, and Ly are the arterial and venous
inertance, respectively. The aortic valve (AV) and mitral
valve (MV) are approximated as a diode which function is
regulated by the parameters kyy and ky. For an healthy AV,
Kay is equal to 1 when p;y 1s higher than p,; otherwise, it
has a value of 10°. Similarly for an healthy MV, kyjy is equal
to | when py is higher than p,y; otherwise, it has a value
of 10°. The peripheral flow gp is described with Eq. 2a as
follows:

_ Pa~Pv
P= (5)
where Rp represents the resistance generated by all the
peripheral vessels. Moreover, we compute the cardiac out-
put (CO) as the average of gp over a complete cardiac cycle.

Pressure levels in the model are dependent on the total
stressed blood volume V,,, that identifies the amount of
blood volume exceeding the sum of all unstressed blood
volumes:

Veo = Vitor — 2 Vin0 (6)

where the summation of n includes the zero pressure vol-
umes of arteries (V4 9), veins (Vy) and ventricle (V,., 9).
Moreover, V,, is also related to the mean circulatory filling
pressure p,,,:

where we neglected the compliance of the LV. In turn, p,,,, is
an important determinant of LV filling pressure, and hence,

mechanics from which we obtain myofiber stress (o,;) and sarcomere
length (/,)

the LV filling volume. An increase in the filling volume will
cause an increase in the sarcomere stretch which in turn will
increase the sarcomere active stress. With a higher active
stress, the ventricle will develop a higher systolic pressure
which will eventually increase the MAP and CO.

2.3 Growth model

Based on our previous work (Rondanina and Bovendeerd
2020), we define the growth stimulus to measure a difference
in the sarcomere mechanics between the current state and the
homeostatic state (hom). A generic growth stimulus S/,.,) 1s
designed to be a function of a stress loading measure L,,) or a
strain loading measure L,,..

L — L
(o;€) (o;€),hom
s (ose) = L (8)

We investigate two types of stress stimuli based on the mean
(Eq. 9a) and maximum stress (Eq. 9b):

where 7... 1S the cardiac cycle length. As strain stimuli, we

maximum strain (Eq. 10b):

LP = max [In (Ay) | — min|In(A,)| (10a)

L™* = max|In(A,)| (10b)
The growth stimulus is then converted into growth of the

wall volume V,,,,, and the unstressed cavity volume V,

according to the following law for stress-based stimuli:

where 7,,,, 1s the growth time constant. The sign in
Eqs. 11 and 12 is related to the chosen L,,.,) and it is defined
such that any divergence from the homeostatic state of Eq. 8
is correctly balanced by a change in V,,,), and V..,9. The
reader might refer to our previous manuscript (Rondanina
and Bovendeerd 2020) for an in depth discussion on this
model.

The combination of four growth stimuli (Eqs. 9 — 10) and
two growth laws (Eqs. 11a and 12a for V,,,, Eqs. 11b and 12b
for V.ay.9) results in sixteen possible combinations that can be
evaluated, see Table |. The four cases in which a strain stimu-
lus drives both cavity and wall growth are labeled as ‘strain-
only’ cases. Similarly, we identify four ‘stress-only’ cases. The
remaining eight cases involve both stress and strain stimuli
and are labeled as ‘mixed’ cases. As in our previous study
(Rondanina and Bovendeerd 2020), we found that switching
the stimuli for cavity and wall growth did not affect the final
grown state. Hence, we evaluate only four cases.

2.4 Hemodynamic feedback model

The hemodynamic feedback is designed in order to maintain
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO) at the
homeostatic level. To achieve this goal, the peripheral resist-
ance (Rp) and the stressed blood volume (V,,) are updated
according to the following differential equations:

may be compensated for by a drop in Rp (Eq. 5). The second
equation is based on the Frank-Starling law: an increase in
V,, will increase p,,. (Eq. 7) and eventually it will increase
the MAP and CO.

2.5 Parameter settings and simulations performed

Homeostatic state Settings of the model parameters are
based on our previous work (Rondanina and Bovendeerd
2020) and are listed in Table 2. As first step, we simulate a
normal cardiac cycle, from which we extract homeostatic
settings of the growth stimuli L, ,o,, and L, nom (Eq. 8) and
the hemodynamic feedback control CO,,,,, and MAP,,,,,,
(Eq. 13). For all simulations, we consider the cardiac cycle
(T.y,) to last 800 ms. Acute state. Second, we introduce
three types of valve disease as model perturbation. We
simulate AS with a threefold increase of ky, during for-
ward flow (pry > Pa) (Eq. 3) (Roger et al. 1997). AR and
MR are simulated by a decrease of ky from 10° to 6, when
Pry < Pa (Eq. 3) and a decrease of ky, from 10° to 30, when
Pry < Py (Eq. 4), to obtain a regurgitant fraction close to 0.6
(Kleaveland et al. 1988; Nakano et al. 1991; Wisenbaugh
et al. 1984).

Growth and hemodynamic feedback The valve diseases
lead the model in a new mechanical loading state in which
the growth stimuli of Eq. 8 and hemodynamic stimuli of
Eq. 13 are no longer equal to zero. As a result, the cardiac
volumes will change according to Eqs. 11 and 12 to restore
the myocardial tissue load L, and/or L, according to the
considered growth stimulus (Table 1). In the presence of
hemodynamic feedback, the circulatory parameters Rp and
V,, will also change to recover the hemodynamic function,
represented by CO,,,,, and MAP,,,,,, according to Eq. 13. We
analyze our results for the case of growth only, indicated by
G, and the combination of growth and hemodynamic feed-
back, indicated by GH.

We assume that cardiac growth, since it requires a volu-
metric structural change, is a slower process compared with
the hemodynamic feedback. For this reason, the constant
Tory 1S Set to 32 ms and 7,,, 16 ms, making the hemody-
namic feedback twice as fast as the cardiac growth.

2.6 Model evaluation

We quantify cardiac growth with the LV end diastolic vol-
ume index (EDVI), the LV mass index (MI) and the relative
wall thickness (RWT). The EDVI and MI are defined as the
end diastolic volume (Vi“*) and LV mass divided by the
body surface area, which is set to 2 m? (Lang et al. 2015),
while RWT is computed as ratio between wall thickness and
cavity radius both at end diastole. Following the classifica-
tion proposed by Gaasch and Zile 2011, we identify dilated
configurations, having EDVI higher than 79 ml/m7, and

hypertrophic cases, with MI higher than 105 g/m”. Moreo-
ver, we identify the geometry as eccentric if RWT is lower
than 0.32, normal if RWT is between 0.32 and 0.42, and
concentric if RWT is higher than 0.42.

To evaluate the models, we compare simulations results
with clinical data. Data obtained from Guzzetti et al. (2019),
Seldrum et al. (2018), Wisenbaugh et al. (1984) are pre-
sented by the mean and standard deviation of the cardiac
indexes EDVI, MI and RWT, as shown in the left panels of
Figs. 3, 5 and 7. Data from (Barbieri et al. 2019a, b) are pre-
sented in terms of clinical occurrence, see the right panels
of the same figures.

3 Results

As we adopted model parameter settings for the healthy state
from (Rondanina and Bovendeerd 2020), we find the same
homeostatic state identified by a cardiac output (CO,,,,,) of
5.2 1/min and a mean arterial pressure (MAP,,,,,) of 12.2
kPa. Maximum and minimum cavity volume (V™* and V™")
are 154 ml and 87 ml, respectively, and a maximum LV pres-
sure (p_.) 1s 18.2 kPa. These values lead to a homeostatic
state characterized by local tissue loads of L"> | of 19.2

o,h
kPa, L™* _ of 59.3 kPa, ve? of 0.12 and L™*_ of 0.17.

3.1 Aortic stenosis

Acute state In the acute state AS leads to a decrease in
MAP and CO around -20% as shown in Fig. (2). Despite
the decrease in MAP, Pow is increased to 21.3 kPa, due
to the increased pressure drop over the stenotic valve. At
tissue level, this increase is reflected in a positive value of
both stress stimuli. Vow remains about the same at 163 ml,
but Vow increases to 108 ml, causing oe to remain close
to zero, but L."? to decrease.

Growth only cases With growth only and no hemody-
namic feedback, indicated by G in Fig. (2), the strain-only
case 1-2, with L-"? driving wall growth and L™* driving
cavity growth (see Table 1), displays a decrease of V,,,1
towards zero and an unbounded increase of V,,, 9. For these
volumes, the model of hemodynamics could not be solved.
The other cases show stable growth, where the controlled
strain measure is fully restored and the remaining stress and
strain stimuli are decreased with respect to their values in
the acute case. In the stress-only cases, model 4-3, with Le
driving wall growth and L;* driving cavity growth, did not
yield stable growth, mostly due to an unbounded increase of
V avo: Phe other cases show stable growth, where the con-
trolled stress measure is fully restored and the remaining
stress and strain stimuli are small. In the mixed cases, the

Q) Springer

controlled L, and L, are restored to their homeostatic levels,
while the other stimuli tend to be reduced as well. LV wall
volume decreases in most of the 10 stable cases, while the
cavity volume decreases, except for the strain-only case with
case 2-2.

Growth and hemodynamic feedback While local tissue
load is restored in the other growth only cases, according
to the controlled stimulus, LV hemodynamic function is
not. Adding hemodynamic feedback, as indicated by GH
in Fig. 2, leads to restoration of hemodynamic function in
all 10 stable cases, identified by Scg = Syap = O (Fig. 2,
right panel). The hemodynamic feedback does not solve
the instabilities in the growth only models 1-2 and 4-3. For
case 1-2, the influence of the hemodynamic feedback is
not significant. For case 4-3, the change in hemodynamic

parameters (peripheral resistance Rp and stressed blood vol-
ume V,,,) allows to simulate more growth steps, but both cav-
ity and wall volume display unbounded growth eventually.
In the strain-only case 1-1, this is achieved by large changes
(more than 50%) in hemodynamic parameters. For all the
remaining cases, the changes are within 20%. Regarding the
cardiac volumetric change (V,,,, and V....9), the strain-only
case with case 2-2 converges at an increase of 300% for
both volumes. For all the remaining cases, cavity volume
decreases while wall volume increases, with changes being
below 50%. Eventually adding hemodynamic feedback tends
to increase the non-controlled stress and strain stimuli in
strain-driven growth. For the stress-driven and mixed cases,
non-controlled stimuli remain fairly constant.

Comparison with clinical data In Fig. 3, we compare
model output with clinical data. The left panels show how
clinical data are characterized by a decrease in end dias-
tolic volume index EDVI and an increase in relative wall
thickness RWT, while left ventricular mass index MI shows
no significant change (Guzzetti et al. 2019). EDVI and MI
are predicted fairly well in all simulations, except for the
strain-based model 2-2. RWT is generally underestimated
without hemodynamic feedback, but improves when add-
ing it. Strain-based models 1-1 and 2-2 do not yield realistic
results for RWT. The right side of Fig. 3 show clinical data
on EDVI, MI and RWT in terms of prevalence in the patient
population (Barbieri et al. 2019a). It shows that growth
upon AS is most clearly apparent in MI and RWT, while
not reflected at all in EDVI. Again observations on RWT
are captured best by the stress-only and mixed models along
with the strain only model for case 2-1, especially with the
addition of hemodynamic feedback.

3.2 Aortic regurgitation

Acute State In the acute case, AR leads toward a decrease
in MAP and CO around 20% (Fig. 4, right). The regurgi-
tant valve causes an increase of Vow tO 180 ml, while ymin
decreases to 83 ml causing both strain stimuli to increase.
The minor drop in pv" to 17 kPa causes both stress stimuli
to remain close to zero (Fig. 4, left panel).

Growth only cases With strain-only feedback, the case 1-2
does not converge due to a decrease of V,,,,, toward zero and
an unbounded increase of V.,,.9. In the cases driven by one
stimulus only (1-1 and 2-2), the non-controlled stimuli tend
to increase. Case 2-1 causes all stimuli to approach zero. In
the stress-only feedback, the case 4-3 does not converge due
to a decrease of LV volumes toward zero. The remaining
cases show stable growth, with the controlled stress meas-
ure fully recovered while the strain stimuli remain almost
unchanged compared with the acute state. In the mixed
cases, the controlled stimuli return to zero, while the oth-
ers are close to zero. Strain-only and mixed cases have an
increase in V,,,,, and V..,9 while with the stress-only cases
we do not obtain significant changes, except with case 3-4
which is also characterized by an increased V,,.), and V....9. In
Fig. (4,right panel), we see how the strain-only case 2-1 and
the mixed cases have a recovered hemodynamic function. In
the other models, hemodynamic function is still decreased.

Growth and hemodynamic feedback Hemodynamic func-
tion is restored in all stable growth cases upon adding hemo-
dynamic feedback. The hemodynamic feedback however
does not solve the instabilities in the growth only models
1-2 and 4-3, which are characterized by a similar divergence
as observed for the growth only cases. In the cases where
hemodynamic function was restored already in the growth-
only cases, changes in circulatory parameters Rp and V,, are

geometry, with RWT > 0.42 (Gaasch and Zile 2011). The dashed
lines identify the homeostatic level

about zero. Cases 2-2 and 3-4, that already showed improve-

require small changes in Rp and V,,. The remaining cases
1-1, 3-3 and 4-4 require changes inR»p and V,, of 15-30%.

back improves the results for MI but worsens those for RWT,
while the EDVI remains almost unchanged. The mixed mod-
els show good agreement for EDVI, but overestimate MI
and fail to predict the decrease in RWT. The right side of

prevalence in the patient population (Barbieri et al. 2019b).
It shows that result of all growth models agree with the clini-
cal observations that EDVI and MI are increased, indicating
dilated hypertrophic hearts. As RWT shows no significant
clinical pattern, it cannot be used to judge the quality of the
growth models.

3.3 Mitral regurgitation

Acute state In the acute state, MR leads to a decrease in
MAP and CO of about 20%, as shown in Fig. 6. The back-
flow through the mitral valve causes a decrease in p?** at 15
kPa and Vi at 56 ml, causing negative stress stimuli and a
positive L-"?. Since V™* remains approximately the same,

converge because of a steep increase of V,,,,,. The other
strain-only cases show stable growth, with the controlled
strain measure fully recovered. The remaining strain and

stress-only cases, model 4-3 did not yield stable growth due
to a decrease of both volumes towards zero. The remaining
cases show stable growth, with the controlled stress meas-
ure fully recovered and the remaining stress stimulus close
to homeostatic level, while all remaining strain stimuli are
positive. Regarding the mixed cases, the controlled stimuli
are fully recovered with the remaining stimuli close to the
homeostatic state. With the stress-only models, we observe
a general decrease of V,,,,, and an increase of V..9, while
for the strain-only and mixed cases we find an increase of
both volumes.

Growth and hemodynamic feedback The hemodynamic
feedback however does not solve the instabilities in the
growth only models 1-2 and 4-3. These are characterized by
a similar change in volume as in the growth only cases. Res-
toration of MAP and CO through hemodynamic feedback
(GH) requires changes in Rp and V,, below 3% for the strain-
only and mixed cases, and more pronounced changes in the
stress-only case, reaching up to almost 50% for case 3-3
and 4-4. Adding hemodynamic feedback causes an increase

of V,,.1 19 most converged cases, except for case 1-1. V.a,.9

increases with case 2-2 and 3-4, decreases with 3-3 and 4-4,
while it remains almost unchanged for the remaining cases.

Comparison with clinical data Clinical data in the left
panels of Fig. 7 show an increase in end diastolic volume
index EDVI and mass index MI, while the relative wall
thickness RWT tends to decrease (Seldrum et al. 2018). The
observations on EDVI are captured by all the 10 converged
simulations. For MI, the addition of hemodynamic feedback
helps only the stress models 3-3 and 3-4, while it causes an
over-estimation for the strain-only and mixed models. The
right side of Fig. 7 shows clinical data on EDVI, MI and
RWT in terms of prevalence in the patient population (Bar-
bieri et al. 2019a, b). It shows that growth upon MR is most
clearly apparent in MI and EDVI. For these cases, adding
the hemodynamic feedback improves the results.

4 Discussion

Cardiac growth is one of the adaptation for the heart to
respond mechanisms to changes in preload and afterload. In
a previous study, (Rondanina and Bovendeerd 2020) we sim-
ulated growth in response to valve disease for several combi-
nations of stress and strain based stimuli. In most cases, we
observed a decrease in hemodynamic function, expressed in
terms of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output
(CO), between 20 and 40%. In the current study, we evalu-
ate the hypothesis that such a decrease is counteracted by an
adaptive response of the circulatory system.

4.1 Considerations on the methods

Hemodynamic regulation is a complex process which
involves short- and long-term mechanisms to maintain blood
supply and consequently oxygen delivery at an adequate
level. It involves hormone synthesis along with the activ-
ity of the sympathetic nervous system (Cowley Jr 1992;
Dampney et al. 2002; Guyenet 2006; Hall 2015). There is
evidence in literature that both MAP and CO are regulated
by an adaptation of vasculature resistance Rp and blood vol-
ume V,,, (Cowley Jr 1992; Guyton 1967, 1981; Jacobsohn
et al. 1997).

In our hemodynamic regulation model, we indeed control
MAP and CO, through changes in Rp and V,,, but do not
aim for a detailed description of the influence of the nerv-
ous system.

Regarding the speed of growth and hemodynamic feed-
back (Eqs. 11 and 13), we reasoned that the body shall react
first to a change in hemodynamic load with the hormonal
and neural response causing vasodilation or vasoconstric-
tion of the peripheral arteries, and hence Rp, or changes in
renal function, affecting Vy. Cardiac growth would occur
at a longer timescale in case of a persisting change in load.

For this reason, our hemodynamic feedback constant 7,,,,
is smaller than the growth constant 7,,,,. The actual values
are chosen in order to limit simulation times. Obviously, the
real timescale would be much longer, presumably on the
order of months. As shown in our previous work (Rondanina
and Bovendeerd 2020), these constants might affect the time
course of changes in circulatory and cardiac parameters, but
they do not interfere with the final ending state of the model.
We verified this by varying the ratio 7,,,,/Tjem Over a range
1/16 < Ty/Them S 16.

We employ a phenomenological growth law, which is
common in many growth models (Witzenburg and Hol-
mes 2017). Such models assume that fiber stress or strain
(or both) can be sensed by cardiomyocytes, and that these
cells respond by growth along or perpendicular to the fiber

direction. They do not address the actual processes at (sub-)
cellular level. The simplification at this level makes it com-
putationally feasible to evaluate the effect of growth at organ
level and to even include adaptation of the circulatory sys-
tem. In comparison with finite element (FE) models, our
model lacks the ability to describe spatially varying growth
in response to spatially varying changes in myocardial load,
as induced for example by myocardial infarction or con-
duction disorders. As an advantage, we avoid the numeri-
cal problems that may arise in FE models, typically related
to distortion of elements during growth or uncertainty on
boundary conditions (van Osta et al. 2019). Thus we are
better able to test the intrinsic stability of a potential growth
law. In addition, the computational load of our model is
orders of magnitude less than that of FE models, allowing a

quick evaluation of different types of growth laws, and offer-
ing more potential for eventual use in the clinic. It has not
been established yet what is the most representative stimulus
for cardiac growth. In the literature, several models have
been proposed with a growth law based on a single stimulus
(Kroon et al. 2009) or on multiple stimuli (Arts et al. 1994,
2005; Kerckhoffs et al. 2012b; Taber 1998). In general, these
stimuli are either stress-based or strain-based (Bovendeerd
2012; Witzenburg and Holmes 2017), although a mixed
stress—strain stimulus has been used as well (Taber and
Chabert 2002). Often growth is driven by a stress stimulus
upon pressure overload and a strain stimulus during volume
overload (Goktepe et al. 2010). Also in our model, we inves-
tigate a mixed stress-strain stimulus. We note that stress and
strain are linked through constitutive equations, but that the
equation for active stress is time dependent. Hence, a full
recovery of stress or strain to the homeostatic state does
not necessarily imply a recovery of the counterpart strain or
stress. AS a consequence, a complete recovery of the strain
level does not necessarily mean a recovery of the stress level.

4.2 Considerations on the results

The growth only cases in general cause a decrease in hemo-
dynamic function identical to the one found in our previous
study (Rondanina and Bovendeerd 2020). The addition of
the hemodynamic feedback caused hemodynamic func-
tion to be restored to its homeostatic level in all 10 stable
stimuli combinations out of the 12 combinations tested.
To assess whether the changes in Rp and V,, are realistic,
we first address clinical observations. The reported range
of Rp for control cases is between 134.6 + 29.9 kPa ms/
ml and 169.5 + 34.5 kPa ms/ml (Ganau et al. 1992; Huang
et al. 2011; Remmen et al. 2005). For AS, it is between
118.2 + 14.3 kPa ms/ml and 194.2 + 60.3 (Friedrich et al.
1994; Lloyd et al. 2017; Rajani et al. 2010). For AR, it is
between 126.4 + 11.2 kPa ms/ml and 169.5 + 29.8 kPa ms/
ml. Finally, for MR it is between 147.0 + 31.0 kPa ms/ml
and 159.0 + 34.0 kPa ms/ml. These data suggest that Rp stays
within the normal range for the various valve pathologies.
As indicator of Vz, we can use the mean circulatory pres-
sure Dn. (Eq. 7), that has a normal value of 2.93 + 1.07 kPa
(Lorsomradee et al. 2007). In this case, we observe a general
increase of p,,. for AS (Carroll et al. 1992; Lloyd et al. 2017;
Martinez et al. 2012) and MR (Kainuma et al. 2011), with
values from 2.93 + 0.93 kPa to 5.33 + 1.33 kPa, but not for
AR (Greenberg et al. 1981; Lorsomradee et al. 2007), which
values span from 2.53 + 0.53 kPa to 2.93 + 0.67 kPa.

With respect to the change in cardiac indexes EDVI,
MI and RWT, we note that the clinical data considered for
Figs. 3, 5 and 7 are in general agreement. Differences occur
with respect to EDVI and MI for AS, as well as the RWT
for the MR and AR. These differences might be caused by

the presence of simultaneous moderate diseases in (Barbieri
et al. 2019a, b) which led to secondary effects. Due to a lack
of clinical occurrence data for a severe MR, in Fig. 7 both
(Barbieri et al. 2019a) and (Barbieri et al. 2019b) are con-
sidered. The resulting clinical occurrence refers to moderate
MR cases in presence of a severe AS or AR.

With the strain-based growth laws, case 2-1 performed
best. In line with experimental observations, changes in Rp
and V.,, are small. Cardiac indexes EDVI, MI and RWT are
predicted well, except for an overestimation of MI in MR.
Case 2-2 yields small changes in Rp and V,, as well, but
EDVI and MI are overestimated in both AS and AR. Case
1-1 requires unrealistically large changes in Rp and Vg, in
AS and AR, whereas MI is severely overestimated in MR.
Finally, case 1-2 did not converge at all.

For the stress-based growth laws, case 3-4 performed
best. Changes in Rp and V,, are small and cardiac indexes
are predicted well, except for a large RWT in AR. Cases 3-3
and 4-4 show unrealistic changes in Rp and V,, during AR
and MR. Finally, case 4-3 did not converge at all.

For the mixed stress-strain cases, we first note that the
final state for the LV and the circulation is independent of
the way the growth stimuli are applied, as was also observed
in our previous study. The results of all mixed simulations
are similar. Changes in Rp and V,, are small, in line with
experimental observations. Also changes in cardiac indexes
match experimental observations, except for an overesti-
mation of RWT and MI in AR, and an overestimation of
MI in MR. In this respect, adding hemodynamic feedback
improved prediction of RWT in AS, but worsened prediction
of MI in MR. Still, the overall affect of adding hemody-
namic feedback in the mixed models is positive, as it restores
hemodynamic function to normal, physiologically realistic
levels, in particular in the AS and MR scenarios.

Since the mixed models are less dependent on the pre-
cise nature of the stimulus and because the true nature of
the growth stimulus is not known yet, we think that these
models are most promising for future research. We note that
the comparison of model results with clinical data is not
trivial. The amount of change in cardiac indexes and hemo-
dynamic parameters obviously depends on the severity of the
disease. We model the AS through a threefold increase of
aortic resistance, while AR and MR are characterized by a
regurgitant fraction close to 0.6. We verified that a different
level of severity did not affect the type of hypertrophy, even
though it leads toward a different ending state. While the
isolated perturbation in the model facilitates our analysis, at
the same time it might not be representative for real clinical
cases, where the valve disease might progress and secondary
pathologies might play a role.

4.3 Comparison with other models

In the literature, the majority of the studies on modeling
growth focus on LV geometry but pay less attention to
the circulation. Arts et al. (2005) proposed a model of
hemodynamic control in which the blood volume and the
peripheral pulmonary resistance were adapted to simulate
pressure control. Moreover, the geometry of the vessels
was also changed to sustain changes in blood flow. Later,
Kerckhoffs et al. (2012a) adopted this model to simulate a
left bundle branch block, in which also the cardiac output
was regulated by peripheral resistance. Along with these
parameters, other candidates for the hemodynamic feed-
back are the arterial and venous compliance (C, and Cy),
the LV elastance and the heart rate (Beard et al. 2013;
Witzenburg and Holmes 2019). Regarding the heart rate,
we maintain this parameter constant. We hypothesize that
a change of heart rate might be interpreted as an incom-
plete hemodynamic adaptation rather than a direct conse-
quence of the studied disease. Moreover, in literature we
did not find any significant correlation between heart rate
and valve disease (Akinboboye et al. 2004; Seldrum et al.
2018). Eventually updates in C, and Cy affect cardiac func-
tion in a similar manner as an update in V,: They change
the mean circulatory filling pressure (Eq. 7) and affect
cardiac function through the Frank-Starling effect.

Our analysis is similar to the one proposed by Witzen-
burg and Holmes (2018) for AS and MR. These authors
also combined lumped parameters models of left ventric-
ular and circulatory mechanics with a phenomenologic
growth law. They fitted circulatory and growth law param-
eters to match results from hemodynamic overload stud-
ies in dogs and tested to what extent the resulting model
predicted growth in independent studies of hemodynamic
overload. They describe LV mechanics with a time-varying
elastance model, that does not allow for an easy relation
between constitutive properties at organ level (describing
pressure-volume relations through compartmental param-
eters ‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘E’ and ‘V,’) and tissue level (describing
stress-strain relations through material parameters ‘a,’ ‘b’
and ‘e’). This relation occurs more naturally in the one-
fiber model that we use in our study, as shown in Eq. la.
Consequently, growth-induced changes in cavity and wall
volume are also reflected in the LV pressure—volume
behavior more naturally. This model also enables com-
putation of local tissue load, with the limitation that fiber
stress and strain should be considered as representative
spatially averaged values. Hence, it is possible to estab-
lish a natural stimulus—effect relation, from tissue load to
change in cardiac size.

Considering the circulatory system, Witzenburg and Hol-
mes (2018) match acute hemodynamic data from the experi-
ments and prescribe the evolution of resistance Rp and the
Stimulus—effect relations for left ventricular growth obtained with a simple multi-scale model:... 2123

degree of mitral valve regurgitation. In our approach, we
prescribe a constant valve pathology and adapt Rp and Vy,
according to our hemodynamic feedback model. Interest-
ingly, Witzenburg and Holmes (2018) find that matching
acute changes in hemodynamics is more important than
matching the subsequent evolution, suggesting that this
evolution involves minor changes as compared to the acute
changes. This observation matches with clinical data and
supports our selection of the most promising models on the
basis of minor changes in Rp and V4.

Considering the growth law, Witzenburg and Holmes
(2018) investigate one option, considered most promis-
ing in an earlier study (Witzenburg and Holmes 2017). In
this model, an increase in maximum circumferential strain
results in an increase in cavity volume and an increase in
maximum radial strain results in an increase in wall volume.
In our model, we do not consider maximum radial strain, or
its surrogate, minimum fiber strain. The option resembling
the one in Witzenburg and Holmes (2018) best would be
the strain-based model 2-1 with maximum fiber strain driv-
ing wall growth and strain amplitude driving cavity growth.
Indeed, we find that this model performs well in the case of
AS and MR, investigated by Witzenburg and Holmes (2018).
However, our models with a mixed stimulus perform equally
well. This confirms the more general conclusion of Witzen-
burg and Holmes (2017), that the most promising growth
laws employ multiple inputs.

4.4 Limitations and outlook

An important limitation of our study is that we considered
two strain stimuli and two stress stimuli only. It would
be interesting to extend the analysis to more stimuli. For
example, minimum sarcomere length could be used as an
alternative strain stimulus, to enable better comparison with
the study of Witzenburg and Holmes (2018). Our analy-
sis could also be extended to other cardiac conditions, for
example the growth of the athlete’s heart where presum-
ably cardiac growth occurs homogeneously throughout the
wall. As addressed above, to assess growth in conditions
that involve spatially varying changes in tissue load, the step
towards a finite element model should be made. The find-
ings of our current study might be used to guide the choice
of the growth model in the finite element model. Finally, the
current model may already form a basis for a tool to predict
patient-specific growth in response to spatially homogeneous
changes in tissue load, since it is computationally inexpen-
sive. As a first step towards this goal, the model should be
tested on its ability to predict growth in individual rather
than generic cases, similar to the approach followed by Wit-
zenburg and Holmes (2019).

Finally, we focused on growth models that resulted in a
stable ending state. While a stable state may be expected
to exist clinically for minor valve pathologies, it is unclear
whether it would exist for the degree of valve dysfunction
used in our simulations. Such data are unavailable since, in
the clinical case, potential unbound growth would probably
be prevented by valve replacement.

Despite these considerations we think the proposed analy-
sis still offers valuable points of reflection.

4.5 Conclusion

We investigated cardiac growth and circulatory adaptation in
response to three valve diseases (aortic stenosis, aortic regur-
gitation and mitral regurgitation). We integrated a lumped
multiscale model of LV mechanics and a lumped model of
circulatory hemodynamics with a model for tissue growth
and hemodynamic feedback. Our study shows the impor-
tance of coupling growth with hemodynamic feedback. With
our model, we succeeded in restoring the homeostatic state
at circulatory level, characterized by pressure and flow, and
at tissue level, expressed in various combinations of stress
and strain. The results obtained by using a combination of
stress and strain stimuli to drive cardiac growth (1) matched
clinical observations on cardiac growth well, (2) required
only a small, clinically realistic adaptation of the properties
of the circulatory system and (3) were fairly insensitive to
the exact choice of the chosen mechanics loading measure.
Thus, this study suggests to model cardiac growth using a
mixed stress-strain stimulus as input, to maintain homoeo-
static tissue load, in combination with a model of hemody-
namic feedback to maintain cardiac pump function.
