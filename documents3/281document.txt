ABSTRACT

Current researchers have focused on DNA-based cryptography, in fact, DNA
or deoxyribonucleic acid, has been applied in cryptography for performing
computation as well as storing and transmitting information. In the present
work, we made use of DNA in cryptographic, i.e. its storing capabilities
(superior information density) and parallelism, in order to improve other

classical cryptographic algorithms. Data encryption is made possible via
DNA sequences. In this paper, two cases utilizing different DNA properties
Keywords: were studied by combining the DNA codes with those conventional
cryptography algorithms. The first case concerned on symmetric cryptography

Asymmetric cryptography that involved DNA coding with OTP (one time pad) algorithms. Asymmetric

DNA-based cryptography was considered in the second case by incorporating the DNA
GZIP codes in RSA algorithm. The efficiencies of DNA coding in OTP, RSA,
OTP and other algorithms were given. As observed, the computational time of
RSA RSA algorithm combined with DNA coding was longer. In order to alleviate

this problem, data redundancy was reduced by activating the GZIP compressed
algorithm. The present experimental results showed that DNA symmetric
cryptography worked quite well in both time and size analyses. Nevertheless,
it was less efficient than the compressed DNA asymmetric cryptography.

1. INTRODUCTION

Cryptography involves encoding a message (encrypted format) prior to transmission so that the data
is unreadable for security reasons. Numerous security algorithms have been proposed as security in data
storage is a major concern nowadays. There are two types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric.
Traditional cryptography can be traced back to Caesar cipher proposed ~2000 years ago. One of the recent
cryptography methods is DNA cryptography which was reported twenty years ago [1].

DNA cryptography is a relatively new cryptographic method that is inspired from DNA computing
by using DNA as information carrier [2]. In fact, DNA can be used for performing computation
and storing/transmitting information [3] thanks to its vast parallelism and extraordinary information density.
Due to these reasons, it has been used in encryption [4], authentication [5], and signature [6]. In general,
the main security depends on the limitation of biotechnology, and not on the computing power [7]. The main
limitation of DNA cryptography is the lack of effective protected theory and simple achievable method.
Therefore, the current research trend in DNA cryptography is to explore the peculiarity of DNA molecule
and reaction so that more useful theories can be established. Typically, a gram of DNA consists of 1021

DNA bases, which is equivalent to 108 TB of data [8]. Gehani et al. [9] introduced the first algorithm of
DNA-based cryptography.

Raj and Sharmila [10] reviewed some DNA cryptographic approaches and highlighted their merits
and demerits. Thilagavathy and Murugan [11] highlighted the security concern in cloud computing, and
proposed a DNA and JPEG Zigzag coding with an encryption scheme. They have reported some
technological implications and contemporary research issues as well. Furthermore, they have proposed an
improved identity-based cryptographic approach. Kannadasan et al. [8] conducted a survey on
the performances of some recent molecular DNA big data technologies. Chauhan and Jain [12] highlighted
the pros and cons of some DNA cryptography methods. Bhateja and Mittal [13] provided a holistic view on
the current trend of DNA steganography by studying their minute aspects related to information security.
Kaur and Malhotra [14] argued that DNA cryptography could ensure data security. The application of DNA
cryptography in RLE data compression has been reported as well. Cherian et al. [15] provided an overview
of several approaches in DNA cryptography. According to them, all digital data can be encrypted by using
extended ASCII. Abood and Guirguis [16] provides a survey of DNA computing by focusing on its application.

The purpose of this paper is to study the efficiency of DNA cryptography using the DNA coding
with the conventional cryptography algorithms. A compressed DNA-RSA was studies to speed up
the conventional RSA algorithm and remove the redundancy. Replace the conventional cryptography by
using (DNA cryptography) to give more strength, by combining the Power of bio-cryptography with
computational cryptography to increase the data security. In section 2 include DNA Structure. Section 3
overview on DNA symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. The performance analysis was given in section 4.
Section 5 explained a theoretical analysis of some types of attacks on DNA Cryptography. Section 6
concludes the current work.

2. DNA STRUCTURE

Nowadays, biological cryptography algorithms become more and more popular, and they are applied
to many kinds of applications. One of the most of these techniques is DNA. DNA is the basic tools of storage
in every living cell. The DNA main function is to absorb and transfer the data for millions of years.
The information in DNA is passed from one generation to the next. The DNA guides the cell to making new
proteins that determine the biological traits for every human being and copy this information and keep it
for billions of years. Thus, it could be around 10 trillion DNA molecules in small size [17]. The structure
of DNA is composed of two twisted strands of four bases that represent the genetic code, adenine (A),
cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G). (A) bonds with the complementary (T), (G) bonds with
the complementary (C), and vice versa. Thus, one strand and the corresponding complementary strand
constitute DNA. For example, one strand is ACTGAA, so the other is should be TGACTT as shown in
Figure 1 [18, 19]. In Tablel we can see that for each DNA bases there is an equivalent DNA coding, for
Example the DNA bases A can be logically represented it by “00”, the same things about the other three
DNA bases T “01”, C “10”, and G by” 11”.

in the DNA cryptography fields, Table 2 includes a brief Description for some researches in DNA
cryptography, and also discuss some of the techniques that been used in these researches, we can see from

Description

They use RSA and Diffie-Hellman with DNA computing. They also used DCT
(discrete cosine transform) coefficients to transfer messages in steganography.
They claim that this proposed provide an extra security for a specific application
where more security is required.

In this proposal authenticate was identify, they used a combine between a DNA
and fuzzy logic. Those results were compared with previous work, show some
achievements. This proposed show a better results in accessing time by
comparison between the protein template and a database template.

This approach is a combine between DNA and elliptic curve discrete logarithm
problem (ECDLP) used for authentication. This paper discussed the previous
DNA and ECDLP. They also show the problems that could face the researchers
when using DNA in information security.

In this paper the authors choose technique near to the human DNA sequence. By
using the same gene from different genes. ProbCons tool and a pair-hidden
Markov model have been used to provide the users with the private/public keys.
This research includes an index-based symmetric DNA encryption algorithm. By
using the block-cipher and index of string, the algorithm has a specific step for
encoding the plaintext. Each character will be encrypted into its ASCII codes.
After that it should be converted into the DNA coding (according to DNA
index). To generate the keys the authors used the chaos key generator based on
the logistic mapping.

This research includes a study of DNA cryptography. They also propose an
algorithm that’s a combine between DNA and OTP. This paper took the benefits
from the randomness and non-repeating that DNA medium provide.

By using DNA computing the researchers propose a technique that provides key
length for encrypt images. The large key 72-bit addition with DNA
complementary provides the encryption text with extra security level.

The researchers proposed a way for providing security by using DNA computing
in producing a key. They claimed that this technique can be used in any
application or any type of data. The strength of security in this technique depends
on the complexity of keys.

The researchers present DNA symmetric algorithm by using the central dogma of
molecular biology and pseudo DNA cryptography. In this algorithm they use
splicing and padding rules to add extra security level.

The researchers proposed an algorithm by combine the DNA sequence instead of
the bits and the advanced encryption standard (AES). They took the benefits
from the biological environment and the DNA computing.

They proposed a symmetric algorithm by using DNA cryptography. They present
a secured symmetric key generation process which generates initial cipher and
this initial cipher is then converted into final cipher using random key generated
DNA sequences.

The authors proposed a new s-box by using the properties of DNA sequence,
XOR and some mathematical operations. They claimed that by changing only
one bit could provide secure S-box, with 255 differences of key. Also, the S-box
inverse could be generated by using same strings that are used in generating the
S-box.

They present method that use round key selection. They provide three levels of
security in first level they use the round key selection and message encryption, in
the second level they use asymmetric key encryption with 16x16 matrix
manipulation, while in the last level they use the shift operation.

In this research a combination of DNA encoding and asymmetric cryptosystem
was used. To produce the key the plaintext was split into chunks with fixed
sized, then encrypts by using asymmetric cryptosystem after that by using DNA
encoding concatenated these chunks to produce the ciphertext.

This research proposed an algorithm that combine between chaotic and DNA
sequences, its symmetric cryptography. The parameters of the algorithms could
be customized by the user according to the requirements.

Zhang, Zhou, 2018 They proposed an image encryption by using DNA cryptography and the Feistel © Symmetric
and Niu [32] network. Initially to produce the hash digest they use the SHA-3 algorithm,

while to produce the Hill cipher matrix they use the chaos-generated sequence.
Then in the Feistel network the DNA sequence has been used.
Patnala [33] 2019 The researchers present a DNA-based cryptography algorithm using DNA Symmetric
Codons. They use a random lookup table contains the DNA codons and their
corresponding equivalent alphabet values as substitution method.

Siddaramappa 2019 They propose an algorithm that uses DNA sequences for encryption and Symmetric
and Ramesh [17] decryption. The key of 64, 128, 192, 256 bits length can be produce by using

genes.
Basu et al. [34] 2019 The researchers design a new system by using the central dogma of molecular Asymmetric

biology (CDMB) by simulating the Genetic Coding and the other operation of
DNA sequence. The plaintext is chunks into 16-bits blocks. Then to produce the
ciphertext the blocks merge in the form of protein bases.

4. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

This paper combined between the use of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, the purpose from
this combination is to see the effect of DNA coding on the cryptography algorithm. One of the most
important points that must be taken into account is the size of files and the time required to accomplish
the encryption and decryption process. Actually, it’s hard to say that this comparison is faire because each
algorithm has its own criteria. The principle goal in the design of any algorithm must be security,
performance, and implementation cost. The performance test method determines the amount of time and size
required to perform cryptographic operations. There is no a standard tool or specific technique for evaluating
or testing algorithm design, because each algorithm is different from the other in designing structure
and internal operations in addition to mathematical bases. The comparison carries out among _ three
algorithms combined between DNA coding and the traditional algorithms: DNA-OTP, DNA-RSA,
and compressed DNA-RSA. This test also includes executing all the necessary algorithms, symmetric
algorithm (OTP), and asymmetric algorithm (RSA). Table 3 shows the difference in size between the plaintext
and ciphertext for each algorithm.

Based on the results and the files obtained in Table 3, Figure 2 indicates that the size of the cipher
text is increased in every test case. It also shows that a large file can also be encrypted using this procedure.
From Figure 2, it can be seen that the DNA-RSA encrypts the text into a huge size while the other algorithms
take a normal size in spite of that the texts are converted into DNA coding before interring into the encrypt
algorithm. The size of decryption cipher text in DNA-OTP are four time more than the plaintext because

the plain text is converted into DNA coding which is depends on four bases (A, T, C, G), while the compressed
DNA-RSA take a normal size near to the conventional RSA algorithm. Table 4 shows the difference
in time (in milli-second) between the encryption and decryption for each algorithm to make a good analysis
between them.

In Figure 3 it could be seen that the compressed DNA-RSA achieved the goal that has been
illustrated, when uses the compression made the result better. The value of encryption and decryption are
near to the symmetric cryptography (DNA-OTP). In spite of using public key in this algorithm which make it
require more computational time. From Table 4 and by using online T.TEST calculator, the P-value of
(DNA-OTP & DNA-RSA) encryption is (0.057) and decryption is (0.042) so it could be said that these
values are Alternative hypothesis. The P-value of (DNA-OTP & compressed DNA-RSA) encryption is
(0.027) and decryption is (0.022) so it’s also considered as alternative hypothesis. The same expatiated result
can be seen for (DNA-RSA & compressed DNA-RSA) the P-value encryption is (0.068) and decryption is
(0.055). To compare the time required and to complete the encryption/decryption operations compared the
execution time of the DNA algorithms with the time required by the traditional algorithms using a random
text of 360 characters, in string format which was applied to all tests. As shown in Table 5, a fair comparison
could not be reached because the download algorithms were executed on different computer with
different properties.

Table 5 shows the DNA algorithms along with the traditional algorithms, DNA with RSA takes
the processing time of 11.78 milli-seconds whereas DNA with compress RSA takes only 4.3 milli-seconds.
In spite of that the compressed DNA-RSA algorithm is a public key cryptography and other algorithm is
symmetric algorithm. As shown in Table 5, the DNA cipher requires a longer execution time for encryption and
decryption, comparatively to the other ciphers. It’s expectable because of the nature of conversion in DNA
coding. The traditional cryptography process array of bytes while in the DNA cryptography is about strings. The
extra conversions efforts make this encryption\decryption require more time.

5. ATTACK ON DNA BASED-CRYPTOGRAPHY

A good security algorithm should be venerable against most kinds of attacks. The purpose from
these algorithms is to reduce the probability of a successful attack and to protect the valuable data. So below
there is an analysis for some types of attack on DNA -based cryptography from theoretical view [35]. A brute
force attack systematically attempts every possible key used in a known plaintext/ciphertext attack. In DNA
the four base genes lack linguistic properties or redundancy as in human language. If the attacker tries to
attacks the communication by using this attack, it would be a very expensive computational problem.
For more security a big key size is very important, to make the primitives more venerable to it [36].

Side channel attacks depends on the additional information taken from the physical implementation
of a security algorithm, like the hardware used to encrypt/decrypt data, the CPU cycles used, performance
calculation, and voltage. DNA cryptography take the benefits from the combinatorial properties of DNA
computation to be more venerable to this type of attacks [37]. Another kind of attacks is meet-in-the-middle
attacks, this kind of attacks used with multiple keys algorithms. It is a known plaintext attack; the attacker
should have access to both the plaintext and ciphertext. This attack attempts to find a middle value that be
used by both plaintext and ciphertext. So, we can say that in DNA cryptography it’s hard to find these values
because there is no relation between the plaintext (regular text) and the ciphertext (DNA coding).

Linear cryptanalysis and Differential cryptanalysis also same as the meet-in-the-middle attacks is
a known plaintext attack. These attacks require a statistical analysis on large amounts of ciphertext. It can
take the benefits from DNA computing, with a very high parallelism and a big amount of storage [3].
The DNA cryptography could be used to pre-process the plaintext. So by combine between the biological
and traditional cryptography could be provide an extra security levels [37].

6. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have reviewed some of the existing DNA based-cryptography with two cases
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. First, a combination of DNA coding with OTP (one time pad)
algorithms, second, the DNA codes in RSA algorithm was studied. The efficiencies of DNA coding in OTP,
RSA and other algorithms were given. From result it could be Saied that the computational time of RSA
algorithm combined with DNA coding was longer. In order to solve this issue, data redundancy was reduced
by activating the GZIP compressed algorithm. The present experimental results showed that DNA symmetric
cryptography worked quite well in both time and size analyses. Nevertheless, it was less efficient than
the compressed DNA asymmetric cryptography.
