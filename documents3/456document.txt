Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao In recent years there has been an increase in research focusing on the effectiveness of
Sl neechaan information is using video games as educational digital resources that can contribute to the learning
available at the end of the article process at different levels, which has also subsidised the development of educational

games. However, these games are mostly visual and not accessible to people with
visual impairments. As an educational resource, it is essential that the design of
educational games be conducted not only with a focus on the balance between

playful and educational aspects, but also with a focus on including the largest number
of people. This article, therefore, aims to describe the design, implementation and
evaluation processes of an accessible version of the educational game Em Busca do
Santo Grau, based on EduGameAccess — a set of recommendations that integrates
educational, playability and accessibility aspects for people with visual impairments.

Introduction
Over the last decades, digital games have become popular due to the advance and the
increasing access of technology to all people. Nowadays, technological devices — and
games — are becoming more present in people’s lives, since most of them are already born
immersed in the digital world (Prensky 2012). Along with this fact, it is noted that recent
generations of learners assimilate knowledge and information in different and new ways
due to the rapid informational dissemination propelled by various technological formats
and media, which have been influencing directly students’ behavior and learning patterns.
Teachers now find themselves facing the daunting task of reviewing their teaching prac-
tices to better meet these educational trends. There is a considerable increase in research
about the effective use of games in the classroom, as a means of engaging the students in
the learning process by speaking a language most of them dominate — the digital one.
We can also perceive a growing interest in research related to the design of good edu-
cational games and that, in fact, integrate and balance the ludic and educational elements
in the game (Klopfer et al. 2009). That is, educational and fun aspects should be consid-
ered together, neither of which should be prioritized, aiming at a game that keeps both
sides in balance and promotes playful experiences of learning. However, as an educa-
tional resource, it is also important that games be designed adopting an inclusive design

approach, that is, taking into consideration the diversity and aiming to guarantee it can
be used by as many people as possible.

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1 billion people world-
wide have some type of disability (Hartley 2011). Data from 2010 Brazilian census (IBGE
CENSO DEMOGRAFICO 2010 2010) reveal that 23.9% of the Brazilian population has
some kind of disability and 18.6% of the population has some kind of visual impair-
ment. Unfortunately, today’s educational games are, in their vast majority, totally visual
and inaccessible to people with some types of visual impairment. In order to foster the
use of modern educational resources in the classroom, such as digital games, it is rather
important to ensure access to these resources for all.

The scarcity of accessible software, which encompasses the growing use of educational
games in schools, is due to the difficulties faced by designers and educators in adapt-
ing and/or developing technologies that allow integrated and complete access to students
with visual impairment. The lack of funding and the insufficient knowledge about effec-
tive design methods have been the major obstacles faced in the development of these
technologies (Archambault et al. 2007).

This work describes the design, implementation and evaluation processes of an acces-
sible version for the game Em Busca do Santo Grau (in English: The Holy Grade
Quest), following the EduGameAccess, a set of recommendations that integrates educa-
tional, playability and accessibility aspects for people with visual impairments (Fontoura
Junior 2018). The obstacles, lessons learnt and the results are also discussed. The
next sections present the adopted research methodology; a theoretical basis on the
current scenario of accessible games creation; related works and, finally, the design,
implementation and evaluation processes of the Em Busca do Santo Grau accessible

version.

Methodology

This work aims to investigate educational game development effectiveness using
EduGameAccess recommendation set to provide good experience for people with and
without visual impairment. This is an applied, exploratory and qualitative research and
the main procedures and methods conducted were: (i) a literature review on game acces-
sibility research to identify the main solutions, challenges and recommendations, as
well as the related works; (ii) game design following EduGameAccess recommendations
and the project requirements; (iii) incremental design and implementation interleaved
with evaluations (inspections using EduGameAccess and user testing) and successive
refinements.

The project development has been carried out in the Laboratério de Objetos de Apren-
dizagem (LOA)!, an interdisciplinary space for studies and research on new technologies
and methodologies for the development of open interactive learning objects. The team
responsible for designing and implementing the accessible levels was composed of four
undergraduate students (Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Linguistics), a
Master’s degree student in Computer Science and a PhD student in Visual Arts, who acted
as game designers, developers, evaluators, illustrators and musicians, having constant

support and guidance from professors in the Computing area.

Literature review

Accessibility in games can be defined as the ease of using a game, even with limiting
conditions, functional, permanent or temporary disabilities — such as blindness, deafness
or reduced mobility. For Archambault et al. (2007), accessibility in games deals with a
more complex problem than accessibility in other types of software. Since the games allow
players to take meaningful actions and see the results of their decisions and choices — also
known as agency (Murray 1997; Gee 2007) — it is important that the accessible ones keep
their playful aspects, without losing the essence of being objects of fun and entertainment.

According to Yuan et al. (2011), game accessibility is intended to make interaction-rich
applications, which have different types of genres. The survey conducted by the authors
on accessibility in games presents correlations between disabilities and games, which
deals with the main genres, deficits and the guidelines that have already been defined to
solve these problems. It is also perceived that although most games seek to consider a
range of different interaction needs, their focus is often in a single type of disability.

Electronic games have emerged as predominantly visual systems capable of promot-
ing entertainment from interactive and artificial conflict, defined by rules that generate a
quantifiable result (Salen and Zimmerman 2012). Currently, games have played an impor-
tant role in shaping the people’s visual culture, especially for bringing signs and symbols
that are increasingly consumed as entertainment and fashion. However, since games are
still essentially graphic systems, visually impaired people tend to search for alternatives
that bring sound as the main element of experience, such as audio games.

According to Archambault et al. (2007), audio games predominantly use auditory ele-
ments to build their gameplay, that is, all the narrative, aesthetic and mechanical elements
that allow the player to interact with computers, consoles and mobile devices. Similarly,
there is a category known as visual audio games which are hybrid games that bring both
auditory and visual elements as equivalent outcomes, allowing both sighted and visually
impaired players to access them.

Some accessibility and playability recommendations are available in the literature to
guide the accessible game development. Most of these guidelines are the result of research
into the methods of designing, implementing and evaluating accessible games. A group
composed of studios, specialists and academics proposed the Game Accessibility Guide-
lines (GAG) (GAG Game Accessibility Guidelines 2019), a complete list of guidelines,
divided by disabilities and subdivided into basic, intermediate and advanced guidelines,
according to the complexity of its compliance and feasibility within the project.The Inter-
national Game Developers Association (IGDA) - Game Accessibility Special Interest
Group (GAG-SIG) has developed a set of accessibility recommendations for games con-
sidering different types of disabilities. Among these, 16 recommendations are specific to
people with visual impairment (IGDA Game Access S.I.G. 2019).

Audio Game Hub, a game for mobile devices and computers, features a collection of
accessible traditional mini games (e.g. Memory, Slot Machines, Labyrinth, etc.) that
bring interactions through audio instructions and stereo-panning effects which allow
sound localisation in a two-dimensional plane (left, right and center) through the use
of stereophonic headphones. Although the game displays a minimalistic graphic inter-
face to sighted players, all the interactions in the menus and buttons have characteristic
Neto et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:4 Page 4 of 16

sound effects and speech feedback that lead blind players to navigate through the available
options and access the mini games (Fizek et al. 2015).

BlindSide, a horror audio-only adventure game set in a 3D world, uses 3D sounds (e.g.
binaural effects) to enhance the sense of navigation and immersion in virtual environ-
ments for blind people through the simultaneous use of sounds produced by the actions
of the avatar, objects, non-playable characters, ambient audio and instructional or speech
cues that give information regarding the current position of the user, the state of the game
and the tasks that need to be accomplished (Friberg and Gardenfors 2004). An experi-
ment taken at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute has demonstrated that blind
people usually finish the game earlier than non-blind players (Balan et al. 2015). The same
first-person technique of the Blindside’s protagonist was used in the Em Busca do Santo
Grau — Accessible Version whose ambient sounds would be heard according to the related
position of the character on the screen, putting the player in the skin of Ariel, the game

protagonist, as a way to improve her immersion state.

EduGameAccess

EduGameAccess’ set of recommendations (Fontoura Junior 2018) covers playability,
accessibility and educational aspects. The set is intended to help developers to produce
good accessible educational games by integrating and refining three important recom-
mendations set: (i) Game Accessibility Guidelines (GAG Game Accessibility Guidelines
2019); (ii) Play — the Desurvire’s Heuristics for good usability in games (Desurvire and
Wiberg 2009) and (iii) Gee’s learning principles from good games (Gee 2007).

Since some of these recommendations do not apply to 2D educational games,
EduGameAccess selects a relevant subset of guidelines, considering this scope, adapts and
integrates this subset, aiming to provide a practical guide to educational game developers.
Furthermore, since a typical development team seldom has the resources to develop fully
accessible games, this set is divided into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels, accord-
ing to their relevance and expense to implement. For this study, the Basic set (Table 1)
was used to guide the design, implementation and evaluation of the game Em Busca do
Santo Grau — Accessible Version.

Em Busca do Santo Grau - accessible version

The educational game Em Busca do Santo Grau is a 2D adventure PC game developed in
2016 by LOA team with the aim of being a multidisciplinary and customisable educational
game with a focus on teachers and students of all levels of education (Bordini et al. 2016).
The game brings the adventure of a young college student called Ariel, who needs to
undergo a series of puzzles at an imaginary university in order to achieve her desired
undergraduate diploma.

The game’s mechanics are mainly based on the player moving the protagonist through
Top-Down scenarios (Fig. 1). Through the interaction with objects and characters, in each
stage the player needs to solve puzzles that is related to the content previously customized
by the teacher. To do so, Ariel can be moved both by pressing W, A, S, D or the arrow keys,
and E to perform actions (such as accessing computers, interacting with objects, opening
doors, chatting with other characters, etc).

The player’s score is represented by an academic index (numerical parameter com-
monly used to measure the students’ performance in undergraduate courses). The player

starts the game with an initial number of 1000 points, which is changed according to
the actions performed throughout the levels (ie. completed tasks add 50 points whereas
errors subtract 50 or 100 points). If all the points are lost, the player will need to restart the
game. The scoring feature in this case can work as a motivation for players/apprentices
to improve engagement, such as promoting replay and consequently improving their
knowledge and skills.

Customisation

Educators tend to face obstacles when it comes to bringing digital technologies into their
classes due to the difficulty of finding or developing resources to meet their needs, and
even when they find such artifacts available, not all of them are adaptable to their teaching
plans. As a possible solution, open educational resources (UNESCO Building Knowledge
2012), which are learning objects with open license that can be reused, adapted, remixed
and redistributed by any person, can be considered feasible solutions capable of ensuring
flexibility in the inclusion of educational content to be shared by technological means.

However, when we consider the development of complex educational resources such as
games, which requires the involvement of a specialized team with different skills, it is not
enough to provide teachers an open license to access and edit various source code files
and images. It is necessary to provide adequate support to grant teachers and students
sufficient autonomy in the creation of their customized instances of these resources, with
little or no programming knowledge or game design skills.

It is within this scope that the REMAR? platform was created by the LOA team with the
aim of facilitating and expanding the construction and reuse of open educational games,
through a free online service that offers tools that facilitate customisation of educational
games without the need of programming skills (Beder and Otsuka 2019). Customised
game instances can be generated and shared for different platforms (e.g. Web, Desktop
and Mobile), and it is possible to add different didactic content into the challenges of

Resources).

each game level, as well as choosing which stages will compose the customised version,
adapting it to the intended pedagogical goals.

In this way, the customisation of Em Busca do Santo Grau game can be made through
REMAR platform directly by teachers. Modular stages can be inserted in the game, such
as those that provide the most suitable mechanics and customisation features according
to the teacher’s educational demands and needs.

Due to the game’s modular and non-linear structure, which allows new scenarios to be
designed and included later between its first and last stages, it was conceived the creation
of three new accessible modules (described and detailed in the next sections), which were
developed with the objective of including people with different types of visual impair-
ment, more specifically colour blindness, low vision and blindness, so they could also have
a playful learning experience, equivalent to sighted players.

Instructional design

The accessible version was developed and evaluated following the EduGameAccess rec-
ommendations, which integrates some important learning principles: clear goals; imme-
diate feedback; gradual difficulty problems; challenges and abilities balance; just-in-time
information/help (see Table 1).

Furthermore, the customization makes it possible to adjust the game to different con-
texts and different educational goals. It is noteworthy that for the inclusion of visually
impaired people, especially blind people, it is essential that all available information can
be perceived through audio and all actions can be performed using the keyboard. The

design, implementation and evaluation process are described next.

Game design

As the original version of Em Busca do Santo Grau is essentially visual, the cre-
ation of accessible modules required rethinking how the game would be fully trans-
ported to the sound universe to be perfectly played only by audio. The visual
stimuli were maintained to guarantee the experience for both sighted and people
with different types of visual impairment. The accessible game development involved
iterative cycles of activities: requirements elicitation; brainstorming; researching; draft-
ing/documentation; development of audio-visual components; prototyping/coding and
testing.

In order to ensure the accessibility aspects for visually impaired people to access the
game, some sound design techniques were followed: (i) the placement of the player’s posi-
tion (their ears) in the same location as the protagonist to simulate a first person sense;
(ii) the equalisation between soundscapes (general scenario sounds), speeches and char-
acters actions, which should always sound clear in the foreground to ensure the player’s
understanding (e.g. audio layers); (iii) the use of the stereo-panning effect to lateralise the
audio and facilitate game events identification (e.g. if a character speaks on the left side
of the screen, the player will hear his voice louder on the left speaker); (iv) the audio rep-
resentation of all protagonist’s actions (e.g. walking, collecting items, suffering damages,
etc.), and the characters and the objects around her.

These technical elements meet the techniques of implementing accessible audio games,
such as Serialisation (priority levels of sound information) and Audio Icons (adding clues
or sound effects to enhance the indication of found objects or actions taken in the game)
Neto etal. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:4 Page 8 of 16

(Archambault et al. 2007; Salen and Zimmerman 2012). The next subsections present the

design of three accessible modules.

Tutorial

Em Busca do Santo Grau begins with a Tutorial stage in which the basic commands and
actions are taught to the player (Fig. 1). In this level, Ariel meets the school principal
(dubbed by one of the LOA members) who contests her low grades. As the principal
speaks, she asks the player to perform some actions in order to learn the controllers, such
as walking towards her table and pressing specific buttons to proceed with the conver-
sation (E), repeat the last sentence (Q) or access the current score (ESC) through audio
cues played from a screen reader. The figure below demonstrates where the main listener
is located (that is, at the Ariel’s position) and the other scenario sound sources.

This stage was specifically designed for the game’s accessible version in order to support
visually impaired players to learn its principles and mechanics. As this is an introductory
scenario, customisation is not available in this case. The scenario ends when the principal
decides to grant Ariel a second chance to find her lost diploma by overcoming a variety
of university challenges, such as the challenges at the Football Pitch and at the Library,

which will be presented in the next subsections.

The football pitch

This is the level where Ariel finds herself in a football pitch, with a crowd in the back-
ground, a capybara mascot on the left side, a goalpost and a goalkeeper in the centre.
At the beginning of the phase, the mascot asks Ariel to go towards him to report what
problems she is facing in the scenario. To reach the Non-Playable Character (NPC),
the player must follow the direction of the mascot’s voice emitted when the Q key
is pressed.

The next challenge at this stage is based on the crowd throwing objects at the pitch
during a sudden blackout. Ariel needs to dodge the objects in order to avoid being hit
and taking damage. These objects emit a decreasing stereo whistle that becomes more
intense as they approach the character’s position. The player’s duty is to try to walk out to
the opposite side from which the sound is coming, which then causes the sound of it to
decrease as the player moves away from the projectiles (Fig. 2).

The final task is kicking the ball to the goal by solving two challenges that require
numerical answers — such as Math or Physics exercises — to find the perfect coordinate.
The phase ends as the player resolves both calculations, kicks the ball to the goal and
passes through a newly revealed gate between the stands so that the heroine can continue
with her quest to get the Diploma.

It is worth to say the required challenges can be customised through REMAR platform
(Beder and Otsuka 2019) according to the learning goals (Fig. 3). Thus, customised game
instances can be generated and shared for different platforms (e.g. Web and Desktop), and
it is possible to add different didactic content into the challenges of each game stage.

Library

In this stage, the player needs to help the ancient Librarian Klapaucius, who has lost his
magical books. Many years ago he put a spell on these books to make them invisible for
safety purposes. The only way to find them in the library is through a proximity auditory
spell contained in each of them, which sonorously indicates how close the book is to the

protagonist. However, due to the librarian’s deafness, he asks the young student to locate
them on the scene (Fig. 4).

When a book is found, the player must discover the magic word through three tips
or clues. The stage ends as soon as the three books are found, and the magic words are
discovered. At this point, a secret passage between the shelves is revealed for Ariel to
continue her adventure.

Similarly to Football Pitch stage, the required challenges in this stage can be customised
through REMAR platform (Fig. 5), where it is possible to define a secret word and three
tips for each book.

Implementation

The game was implemented using the engine Construct 2, which consists of event blocks
to program all the mechanics and graphic behaviours in the game. For audio creation and
editing, the digital audio workstation (DAW) Propellerhead Reason was used, containing
an extensive library of plugins, instruments and effects that allow audio manipulation to
achieve a good sound quality. Some Creative Commons (CC) sound effects were collected
from free web audio libraries (such as Freesound) and mixed through the open-source
digital audio editor Audacity. The characters’ voices were recorded by the LOA members
at the university’s studio.

The game’s programming software also supports the placement of different receivers
and stereo sound sources in the game environment (screen). This feature can help the
player to identify the objects and characters on stage through the sound they emit — using
the right and left channels of the speakers and/or stereoscopic headphones. In addition
to the positioned sounds, screen reading was possible using a Construct 2 plugin called
User Media, which adds a multimedia component to the game capable of synthesizing
any textual object into voice, using any voice API[1]. Therefore, it was used the Google
voice API, supported by all modern browsers.

This feature was essential for this project, considering that the didactic contents are
customisable. In cases of games in which the textual structure of the levels is fixed, the best
alternative is recording the dialogues and other texts, for the narration produces greater
immersion within the game world. The version with the three accessible modules of Em
Busca do Santo Grau has been exported to HTML5 and can be executed by any browser.

Evaluation

The game evaluation was conducted using three methods: specialists inspection, user
testing and EGameFlow questionnaire (Fu et al. 2009). The results are presented in the
following subsections.

Evaluation by specialists

In order to analyse the game compliance with EduGameAccess set of recommendations,
evaluations were carried out by 7 experts in Games and Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) at Federal University of Sao Carlos (from many areas and levels of studies such as
Undergraduate and Graduation in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Master in
Computer Science and Doctor in HCI), between September and October, 2018.

The evaluators were invited to analyse the game according to the EduGameAccess’ basic
recommendations, assigning grades from 0 to 5 to each recommendation or indicating it
as not applicable to the game. All of them received a link to test the accessible modules of
the game, and the list of basic recommendations of EduGameAccess.

Figure 6 presents a stacked bar chart representing each specialist grade assigned to each
EduGamedAccess recommendation.

The boxplot chart in Fig. 7 represents the maximum grade and the minimum grade

of the grades, while the top of the unpainted rectangle represents the median. For painted
rectangles, the opposite: the base indicates the median, and the top, the average.

It is possible to observe a predominance of 5 (maximal) grades in most recommen-
dations, all of which present at least 3 specialists with a maximum score, except for
recommendation 4 - about providing separate volume controls for sound effects, voice
(dialogues, reading screen, narration, etc.) and background music. The game provides
separate controls for sound effects and background music but does not provide voice
volume control. In future versions of the game, it is therefore intended to include voice
volume controls for previous recorded narrations and dialogues. However, a solution
for volume control at run time for the speech synthesiser (for reading the customisable
content) has not yet been found, as it is a native browser tool.

User testing

The user testing was performed at the end of the implementation, in order to validate
the new modules in playability and accessibility. The tests were conducted with 17 users
divided into 4 groups: 5 people with no visual impairment, 4 colour-blind, 5 with low
vision and 3 blinds. During the test sessions, physical and emotional reactions, facial
expressions, easiness and difficulties during the gameplay were observed. The volun-
teers were asked to think-aloud while playing (think-aloud protocol), making possible to
observe their intentions, doubts and difficulties (Lewis and Rieman 1994).

The volunteer groups’ profiles were very diverse, therefore the development team could
bring together players with high potential of identifying themselves in the game world,
respecting the initially intended target public. The testers with no visual impairments
were aged from 16 to 27, students ranging from High School to Master’s Degree, and all of
them were familiarised with the daily use of technologies, being 3 of them casual players
and 2 daily players.

The colour-blind testers were aged from 19 to 30, all undergraduate students, and
have indicated daily use of technologies, being 2 daily players, 1 casual player and 1 a
rare player. The volunteers with low vision were aged from 20 to 46 years, ranging from
Undergraduate to PhD Degree, in different levels of low vision, all of them daily users of
technologies, but 2 daily players (the youngest), 1 that never plays and 2 casual players
(the oldest). The 3 blind testers were aged from 19 to 49, all undergraduate students, daily
users of technologies, being 2 rare players and 1 casual player (the youngest).

During the tests, the users with low vision easily understood the game mechanics, and
were able to play and finish all the tasks with no need of external help. Two of the testers
made suggestions regarding the need of voice-synthesising the text typed in the answer
boxes automatically, in order to make the orientation easier for the users, as the keys were
being pressed - which is now done only under the use of the key "E". Altogether, it was
possible to observe feelings and expressions of satisfaction from the players during their
interaction.

Tests with colourblind users were similar to the players with low vision, as they easily
manipulated the different controls in-game and quickly learned the mechanics. One of
the users complained that he had previously faced troubles in differentiating shades of
similar colours such as green and brown or green and red when played other games, but
attested that Em Busca do Santo Grau was well balanced in this matter. The users did not
express too many emotions during the playtest sessions, but declared satisfaction while
being interviewed.

The volunteers without disabilities also had no difficulty in understanding the mechan-
ics nor in completing the tasks. Besides, they showed interest in the challenge, in the
gameplay and in the game main elements. One of them expressed fun and excitement ges-
tures whereas another participant was quite thrilled with the challenges and the game’s
references related to other media (e.g. games and movies).

The tests with blind players followed the same protocol as the tests conducted with
other volunteers in which the users fulfill their required task. The first user demonstrated
a reasonable understanding of the mechanics, despite showing difficulties and insecu-
rity. In contrast, the second user evinced the biggest difficulties and demonstrated little
understanding of the game mechanics. The main problems reported by this user were:
not recognizing the game sounds and his/her next steps in the game. The third user
demonstrated a complete understanding of the actions required to accomplish the task
and demonstrated vigorous emotions, laughs and gestures.

The main problems identified in this process and possible solutions are presented in
Table 2.

eGameFlow
The eGameFlow, a validated instrument to measure learners’ enjoyment in educational

games (Fu et al. 2009), was answered by the 17 participants in the user testing. Figure 8

Identified Problems

Proposed solutions

 

Some users did not wait for the synthesised voice
instructions to finish, and tried keyboard commands
at inappropriate times, for example, accessing the
input field before hearing the question.

Once the user has selected the input field to type in
the answer, they no longer have keyboard access to
the clues that would help them answer the question
in the Library Level. This is a limitation of the Con-
struct 2 game engine, which does not control the
focus out of the input field once it is focused in it.

Some users attempted to move around the scenario
by repeatedly pressing the directional keys, rather
than holding them down.

The dialogues and instructions can be very long for
some players. A solution for future work is to imple-
ment a speech synthesiser speed control so that
the reading speed could be configured. Shorten the
instructions.

In web projects using HTML5, where text fields are
used in game, the text field can be focused in (for
text input) or out (to control the remainder of the
layout). Specifically for projects generated via Con-
struct 2, this is not possible. In future projects, game
engines that have support for control of text fields,
such as Unity, should be considered.

Adjust the movement of the character so that when
the keys are pressed, the character walks more than
a few pixels.

eGameFlow Questions

 

 

Fig. 8 Box plot chart - User evaluation result using eGameFlow

 

represents the distribution of grades from 1 — fully disagree — to 7 — fully agree — for
each of the 39 eGameFlow questions. The Fig. 8 presents a box plot chart with maximum,
minimum, average and median grades for each eGameFlow question.

It is possible to observe that, even considering all categories of users, all medians were 7,
except for question A4 - "Does not the game allow players to make mistakes that prevent
them from advancing in the game?", which users did not fully agree with the information
that the game contains only errors that would not prevent them from progression into
the game. This happened because some users encountered a bug while answering the
questions of the Football Level, where the second question was not read by the voice
synthesiser or was read with the text of the first question. This happened because some
browsers were too fast in processing the commands to activate the voice synthesiser, and
in some cases, it triggered the commands before the game moved on to the next question.
The bug was later solved and the issue did not appear anymore.

Results and final considerations
This work made it possible to observe the use of EduGameAccess set during the whole
development course of an accessible educational game and to validate its effectiveness in
supporting all stages of this process. The evaluation results indicated that EduGameAc-
cess was effective in helping developers to produce good accessible educational games and
provide equivalent gaming experiences for people with and without visual impairment.

A major difficulty faced through the development process was the limitations of the
adopted engine, Construct 2, which does not offer full support for some accessibility
resources, or they exist but are outdated. Even though it can generate a HIML5 web ver-
sion for the game, the engine uses technologies such as HTML Canvas, which renders
both text and image on the browser screen, making the game’ visual material unreadable
to conventional screen readers.

Suggesting accessible solutions for the visually impaired with regards to teaching
through digital games is rather a difficult task, but an equivalent experience for both
the visually impaired and sighted users in the same game is a much bigger challenge.

It requires a plural and interdisciplinary team, involving final users throughout the
Neto etal. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:4 Page 15 of 16

development process, testing, taking part in the implementation decisions and refining
the game as it grows during development.

The produced game is going to be available as an open educational resource in REMAR
platform and can be used by anyone to create custom instances of this accessible educa-
tional game. The source code alongside the complete set of game development artefacts
are available in the GitHub project repository (available at: https://github.com/LOA-
SEAD).

As a next step, the development team plans an adaptation of Em Busca do Santo
Grau into a fully accessible version, where all modules are playable by both the visually
impaired and sighted students. In addition, new evaluation and refinement cycles may be
conducted.
