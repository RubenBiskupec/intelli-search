University, Riyadh, Saudi core value of education to better meet students’ needs by leveraging big data and digi-

Arabia tal technology. Based on this background, this study attempts to catch the principal
trends, or new directions, paradigms as predictors with an association of each topic by
discovering the up-to-date research trends on teaching and learning in higher educa-
tion via text mining techniques. For this, 285 research articles in the area of teaching
and learning in higher education were collected from several big databases (distin-
guishable publishers’ web platforms) through search engines for 2 years in 2018-2019.
Then it was analyzed using a semantic network analysis that processes natural human
language. Consequently, research results show a relatively high connection with
‘student’ or ‘student-centered/led’ rather than ‘teacher-led! Moreover, it exhibits that
the practice and assessment in learning can be attained via diverse learning activities,
containing community or outreach activities. Besides, research in academic contexts,
experience-based classes, the effect of group activities, how students’ feelings or per-
ceptions, and relationships affect learning outcomes were addressed as the main top-
ics through topic modeling of LDA, a machine learning algorithm. This study proposes
that educators, researchers, and even academic leaders can exert extraordinary power
to reshape educational quality programs for future education and in a timely manner
with recognizable trends or agendas in teaching and learning of higher education.

Introduction

Digital transformation in higher education covers many things from using digital tools
such as LMS (Learning Management System), Interactive whiteboard, various applica-
tion tools for e-learning, etc. in university classrooms to digitize university documents.
However, it does not just involve in utilizing advanced tools. The change and growing
demand can be more profound and deep, incorporating whole aspects of education.
Although there is an initial resistance to new technologies caused by continually chang-
ing, we have no choice but to hold and follow this latest trend [11, 53]. Moreover, no
matter what has happened to us in the past and what is going on in our current lives,

there is no power to keep us from having an unknown future with high uncertainty. It

is the main reason we should be aware of the latest trends or changing circumstances
around us. Accordingly, efforts to look at trends or predict a new paradigm based on
historical big data in teaching and learning has been around continuously in the various
educational sectors of higher education [1, 4, 16, 17, 39, 53]. In particular, main issues,
which have traditionally started from finding trends about students’ learning [17, 20],
expand into teaching and learning broadly [22, 58]. Furthermore, now it amplifies into
research and development [7, 16, 18, 19, 27, 29, 37, 41, 42, 44]. Besides, previous studies
favored measuring the higher education curriculum’s achievement or improvement and
measuring the outcomes to fulfill the highest standards [2, 6]. Past research trends that
studied diverse factors affecting students’ learning attitudes and learning outcomes have
been extended to diversified research areas. Those comprehensively connect distinct
educational issues and teaching and learning methods. For example, new techniques
such as flipped learning, blended learning, and interactive ways maximize education
effectiveness [45, 48, 49, 51, 64]. Furthermore, there is an ever-increasing range of con-
nections with multiple stakeholders around education, management, administration,
policy, and leadership in higher education [8, 35, 44].

Thus, recognizing the latest issues or trends of how teaching and learning in higher
education have conducted in research has a special meaning to reflect the present and
previous studies and seek desirable directions in the development of future education [7,
18, 19, 27, 29, 37, 41, 42]. Consequently, a number of researchers in diverse educational
sectors have shown many distinguished studies related to those topics with different
perspectives to keep up with the most popular and the latest educational trends. How-
ever, most studies are independent studies based on a specific situation or context rather
than grasping the overall academic flow. Besides, most of them were investigated with
qualitative and subjective methods through surveys and interviews, such as focus group
interviews. Also, reviews of scientific publications such as articles or books, course syl-
labus, etc. are implemented to manually gather non-numerical data. This qualitative
research approach provides obvious implications and contributions comprehensively
to understand and explore an educational situation or a higher education phenomenon.
However, it is a study confined to individual conditions or specific circumstances inde-
pendently. Moreover, there is a potential to create subjective judgments or arguments
when applying for different occasions or environments [41, 42]. Hence, this study aims
to supplement the limitations of those existing studies and grasp the general current
flow of teaching and learning through big data. By identifying the latest teaching and
learning trends in higher education through semantic network analysis, a text mining
technique using big data of unstructured texts, this study catches the fundamental direc-
tions and main topics, including the linkage of each issue. In conclusion, this research
can provide a wealth of insights to guide educators, researchers, and academic leaders
in higher education with a trend-based approach in quality education. The latest educa-
tional issues identified using big data and advanced technologies will help renovate and
reshape future educational programs. Also, in the face of rapidly changing educational
trends and dynamic environments, it will meet the different needs of diverse stakehold-
ers around higher education.

The rest of this research paper is organized and illustrated as follows. The next section

presents reviewing existing studies extensively. Then, a proposed research framework

with research questions is addressed. After that, the data and methodology are pre-
sented and analyzed in the section of results and discussion. Lastly, the implication and

conclusion are included in a future research direction in the last section.

Literature review
Researches about teaching and learning in higher education
A past or present, a critical issue to higher education lies in teaching and learning.
Accordingly, different agendas from a wide variety of perspectives in higher education
are progressively evolving. However, we need to revisit the basic principals and focus
on the essential subjects of teaching and learning [9, 45, 48, 49, 51, 60, 64]. Traditionally,
education has focused on finding the diverse matters surrounding the roles of students
and teachers, respectively, to examine the learning effects and the factors that influence
it, that is, to find cause and effect (causality) in teaching and learning [16, 17]. It has
progressed into an in-depth discussion of how psychological factors, such as students’
perceptions, feelings, or relationships with teachers, influence learning outcomes [24,
36, 62]. What is more, many studies examined how various demographical factors such
as gender, race, and income level of families affect students’ learning or its outcomes
[25, 30, 57]. In addition to this approach, attention was paid to the teachers’ point of
view to find out more effective teaching methods and what new teaching methods were
being developed and used and how those methods worked. For example, flipped learn-
ing, blended learning, online learning, or interactive learning using various technology
tools or simulation game. These are the most recently adopted teaching methods [19, 21,
23, 34, 60].

Other endeavors have been made to find general trends in teaching and learning with
a holistic perspective [13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 27, 37, 41, 42]. Deng et al. [13] focused on iden-
tifying trends and categorizing the study on Massive Open Online Courses in teach-
ing and learning. Elton and Laurillard [16] sought to find research trends in students’
learning and discover new research paradigms. They analyzed the trends to uncover the
determinants of how humans learn, the differences among individuals in human educa-
tion, how content elements affect learning, and how contextual factors affect learning.
Guri-Rozenblit [20] reviewed and analyzed four books that can use to examine trends in
learning. Based on this, he defined the definitions of distance education and open educa-
tion. He covered a wide range of free public/distance systems, course design, advanced
technology, and delivery systems, student support and survival issues, and lastly, inter-
university and inter-institutional collaboration issues. Henderson et al. [22] studied
students’ perceptions of useful digital technologies in teaching and learning in the uni-
versity, which has an online education or interactive education through an online sys-
tem. It is attracting attention as research that captures the transforming the nature of
university education. Nikitina and Lapina [41] proposed that recent business education
trends were organized into three categories: a curriculum that meets the desire of soci-
ety and business, partnership & networking, and a modern and flexible teaching method
in their research. Besides, new forms of teaching and learning, including blended learn-
ing, interactive learning, and flipped learning, have been addressed by many scholars
[21, 34, 60]. Besides that, a large number of studies have mainly concentrated on the
numerous factors or trends affecting educational development and management [19, 27,

37, 41, 42]. For instance, Nomuoja [42] studied the current trends emerging in business
schools of higher education. Consequently, career awareness, risk management, people-
oriented strategy and management, and skills-based curriculum were mainly discussed.
Moreover, there are interviews from international top MBA schools to discover major
MBA trends such as ‘growing trend of double degrees; growth acceleration of online or
technology-based education and blended learning in business education [19, 23, 37].
Accordingly, a considerable amount of research has been done with broad and varied
teaching and learning perspectives. However, most of them were independent studies
investigated based on a specific situation or context rather than grasping the educational
flow or trends. Moreover, there is still a lack of study that looks at the global direction of
such research more objectively and quantitatively using big data. Hence, this study aims

to fill in the gap of these existing studies.

Semantic network analysis using big data of the unstructured text

We live in an era where all aspects of our lives are uncertain and rapidly changing [28,
33, 47]. The best way to cope with this uncertain and unknown future is to predict and
prepare for the future based on various historical big data by reducing this prediction
error. In this regard, people focus on using big data to read trends and prepare for the
unknown future. This substantial phenomenon is well represented in diverse and sepa-
rate research fields as well. Many scholars in a very different area are working actively to
discover insights into big data using various data mining techniques [1, 15, 26, 38, 46, 47,
52, 53, 55, 63]. We can deal with big data or data sets due to the breakthrough technol-
ogy, which is too complicated or broad to be dealt with by traditional data-processing
approaches. In particular, it became possible to analyze a large amount of unstructured
text data through text mining, one of the data mining techniques, as linguistic tech-
niques have developed and applied to diverse areas [11, 38, 61].

A morphological or semantic network analysis deals with dividing a sentence into
the smallest meaningful unit of language, namely, morphemes by importing unstruc-
tured text data such as speeches, comments, or posting in social media like Twitter,
Instagram, or any bibliographic information (for example, books, scholarly articles,
records, interviews, etc.) [15, 26, 43, 47, 63]. It automatically extracts words in sen-
tences, paragraphs, and documents to make it simple to construct a word-to-word
network according to the degree of nearness or adjacency between words [3, 26].
Based on that, network structures provide intuitive and beneficial illustrations for
modeling semantic inference and knowledge [55]. Through this, we can comprehend
the relationship among words or understand their association by combining topics
through proper interpretations in a given text [12, 50, 55]. The more commended, the
larger the size of the morpheme or word. It can then be seen at first sight, as it were,
to visually stress major issues or agendas such as keywords in unstructured docu-
ments to extract critical attributes, mainly in big data that manages a large amount of
information. Nodes in a semantic network mean words, and links are word-to-word
adjacency relationships [43]. Until recently, network analysis required data structured
by nodes and ties ahead of time. The subsequent processes were performed by indi-
vidual programs, which required plenty of human efforts and time. However, with

state-of-the-art technology development, natural language processing is built into

Page 4 of 17

(2020) 7:93

data mining programs, which can directly enter unstructured text data and extract
words (nodes) in morphological units and create network data encompassing words.
It broadens the network analysis horizon with massive unstructured text data [12, 29].
Accordingly, a large number of scholars has ripened into a semantic network analysis
as a powerful tool of text mining in numerous ways since Rice and Danowski [50]
built a basic framework for network analysis [15, 40, 50, 56].

The purpose of analyzing text using text mining is very diverse. It is possible to
comprehend between the lines in which the document intends to deliver by reassem-
bling the text. Also, by visually grasping the relationship between the main concepts
and other keywords in the text, it is easy to understand various networks. Through
this, it is achievable to analyze the roles of words and their relationships by recogniz-
ing the word associations. One of the most significant benefits in text mining is to
analyze the terms both qualitatively and quantitatively [11, 38, 39]. Additionally, it
uses to visualize or illustrate the relationship between objects or people in text and
topic modeling [26, 43]. For this, a large amount of information can efficiently and
effectively utilize to generate more comprehensive and extended knowledge, analyti-
cal reasoning, and even explorative analysis, which is the final goal of text analysis [11,
12, 14, 38, 39, 59]. With those benefits of this approach, many scholars have discussed
various topics with different perspectives using big data. Many scholars and observers
have found huge opportunities and tremendous potentials of semantic network analy-
sis with recognizing centrality indicators between words and sub-network structures
of words [32, 50]. Many of those studies exhibit the possibility of the ongoing devel-
opment of the semantic networks as a powerful research tool emerging with the big
data era's advent. In particular, semantic network analysis is used in research to study
teaching and learning in higher education. Shen and Ho [51] showed the importance
of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) through a semantic approach as an inspired
way to improve teaching and learning outcomes in high education. Kim [27] deter-
mined the study trends of music education using the semantic network analysis. Lee
[31] analyzed the research trends in the area of journalism, pursuing the key words of
the abstract of research articles published in 2005-2015 through semantic network
analysis, then, finally established knowledge system as a result. Besides, Kim et al.
[29] applied semantic network analysis to draw a significant agenda of nursing care
service opinions by extracting data from online news and social media data. Recently,
Park [47] took the data of news media and social media to compare the trends from
the two different kinds of big data sources to predict leading Korean companies’
sustainability.

Based on those previous studies, this study aims to investigate the most recent
research issues and latest trends of teaching and learning in higher education through
semantic network analysis. Using a large amount of unstructured text data, we can
effectively and efficiently discover trendy insights and directions of future educa-
tion in teaching and learning and research [15, 52, 53, 55]. Accordingly, it expects to
generate subsequent development of knowledge and intuition to comprehend a new
paradigm of future education in general, which is just around the corner. It would be
very constructive and beneficial to educators, researchers, academic leaders, and even

administrative leaders in higher education.

Proposed research framework

To pinpoint major agendas and trends in teaching and learning of higher education,
semantic network analysis, a data mining technique, was used in this study. Accordingly,
there is no theoretical framework with hypotheses as the data-driven approach is used in
this paper. This data-driven methodology became an extraordinarily capable and prom-
ising area. A massive amount of information reserved in electronic and digital records
on the internet brings tremendous opportunities and impacts remarkably for knowl-
edge discovery, information extraction, and analytical reasoning in education fields [15,
40, 61]. Thus, this empowers one to extract important algorithmic properties that give
powerful intuitions and insights into the structure of networks and graphs [38, 53, 55,
65]. As previous literature shows, a researcher can collect big data from various sources
and platforms. For example, news channels (such as BBC, CNN, ABC, etc.), social media
(such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.), web or internet search engines
(such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, AOL, Journal databases or publishers’ databases, etc.),
other financial reports (such as financial statements, press releases, conference calls
regarding earnings and related information, etc.), and so on [11, 39, 47, 53]. In this study,
the data were gathered for analysis from several distinguishable publishers (Sage Publi-
cations, Taylor & Francis, and Elsevier BV)’ web platforms through search engines. Fig-
ure 1 shows the proposed framework of this study with a holistic approach.

This study attempts to determine the most recent research agendas or trends of the
leading higher education journals about teaching and learning in 2018 and 2019 through
semantic network analysis. As the global trend is changing very fast, this study empha-
sizes teaching and learning in the last 2 years. For this purpose, this study establishes the
following research questions.

(1) What are the main trends or agendas of teaching and learning in higher education
in the last two years?

(2) What are the critical attributes of teaching and learning in higher education, and
what are the implications of this?

(3) How are the specific sub-domains (topic modeling) of teaching and learning in
higher education categorized as future education strategies?

Data and methodology

Data collection

This study aims to identify the most recent educational trends and predict future direc-
tions or shifts by recognizing the main issues of teaching and learning in Higher edu-
cation. For that, the data collected from 285 research articles of four international
‘top-tier’ journals ranked as ISI/SCOPUS Q1 in this field for 2 years (2018-2019) in the
big databases of each publisher’s web platform. The data were selected according to the
following criteria using the search engine: ISI/SCOPUS indexed, reputable publishers/
open-access journals, and international peer-reviewed journals in Table 1. Then, seman-
tic network analysis, a powerful and compelling technique in a significant data era, is
used to extract patterns or directions with uncovering data-empowered insights. Conse-
quently, 587 unique keywords, 1743 sentences, and 285 paragraphs and documents were
identified in 285 abstracts of research articles through NetMiner4’s semantic network
analysis program. NetMiner is an eminent application software tool for exploratory
analysis and visualization of extensive network data. It also includes several functions
and features for data analytics, such as machine learning algorithms, semantic network
analysis, etc. It has optimized operations and structure that can efficiently process large
amounts of unstructured text data. Accordingly, the study uses this software program,
particularly semantic network analysis, which is the most appropriate method to achieve
the research questions.

Data cleaning with refinement

Most commonly, data encloses ambiguous and unnecessary contents. Particularly,
unstructured text data include meaningless and illogical messy texts such as symbols,
colon, emoticons, consonant and vowel data, and even slang and spelling errors. Thus,
it is necessary to filter and purify the data through pre-processing for data cleaning and
refinement [5]. In the pre-processed text, the word tab is integrated into the result area.
The Word tab provides such information as a list of words, frequency of use, part of
speech, which is to be extracted from the unstructured text contents according to the
text process settings. After refining, the data are cleaned up, and the quality of the messy
data for analysis is improved overall. In this study, messy data were tidy up using Open
Refine (used to be called Google Refine), one of the best tools for data cleaning and
refinement. Also, the word filtering of data cleaning software in the NetMiner was used
for double-checking.

Results and discussion

This study’s first objective is to determine the most studied topics in the field of higher
education in 2018 and 2019. For this, the top 20 keywords are selected through semantic
network analysis among 587 keywords appearing in 285 abstracts of research papers in
four top journals related to the issues of teaching and learning in 2018-2019. The result
is as shown in Table 2.

According to the results, the main ‘top 20’ keywords of teaching and learning in higher
education cover the topics of ‘students-centered or student-led learning’ rather than
‘teacher-led’ and that, research, experience, group, development, practice, and engage-
ment are identifiable. Especially, the word ‘student’ composed 7.11% of the total 797
times as a leading keyword showing the highest frequency, and it follows by study, learn-
ing, education, research, university, and experience. They are 2.97%, 2.41%, 2.04%, 1.81%,
1.81%, and 1.18%, respectively. In this study, a directional link (Directed Network) based

on the ‘Binary Network, which does not weigh the connecting line, is created. Here, the

frequency of a node is an amount defined for each node and means the number of con-
nection lines of each node that exists as a neighbor. In-degree refers to the number of
edges coming towards a vertex in a directed graph; out-degree refers to the number of
arcs directed away from the vertex. Although Table 2 shows the keywords in the top 20
ranks, it observes that a few keywords in the top and the other keywords show a great
difference in the number of nodes in- and out-degree. Accordingly, for the detailed view
at a glance, a word cloud is created to check each keyword’s quantitative importance.
Then, it considers the relationship and features of keywords in more detail through net-
work map and topic modeling. Word Cloud is a visualization tool that illustrates the size
of letters according to the importance of keywords. Based on that, we can notice the
difference between relatively meaningful words, in brief, to understand how much dif-
ference is there. In this study, the word cloud node attributes are used to display infor-
mation as frequency and number of words by entering the maximum number of words
as 100. The result of the word cloud is as follows in the Fig. 2.

Meanwhile, the word-to-word network is visualized with a network map to under-
stand the data analysis results intuitively. It means that the network data is calculated
and arranged according to NetMiner’s layout algorithm’s program. A layout algorithm
is a method of calculating where to place nodes to visualize network data. Among the
usual methods, Spring Layout is chosen as it can show the connection structure most
effectively. Spring layout can be expressed by various algorithms such as Kamada &
Kawai, Stress Majorization, and Clustered Eades, Fruchterman & Reingold, GEM,
HDE, etc.

Among them, Kamada & Kawai, Stress Majorization, and Eades are chosen as these
algorithms fit the need for data analysis and representation, then compare them as
preliminary work to consider the number of various cases of subtopic extraction
inherent in a given text. In this study, the isolated nodes are shown at the edge of
the network map and visualized comparing the ‘Kamada & Kawai, ‘Stress Majoriza-
tion; and ‘Clustered Eades’ network maps deselecting isolated nodes. The layout of
the analysis results is as follows in the Fig. 3.

After importing unstructured data, a 2-mode network between words and sen-
tences/paragraphs/documents generated in the program of NetMiner transforms into
the keyword—keyword 1-mode system of the research presented in the major journals
about teaching and learning. Here’s a look at the detailed layout with keywords from
the three core types of network maps in Fig. 4.

In the NetMiner program, a 1-mode network generates by using word-to-word dis-
tance information. In this study, the nearness of two words is calculated, and based
on that, a method of creating links between words located close together is used. The
number of words includes setting the link generation range between words called
“Window Size. In this study, a maximum of 3 words is included in the link genera-
tion range by entering Window Size as 3. Links create between words according to
the Window Size set as above, and the two linked words are displayed as Source and
Target, respectively, in Table 3.

The term TF (Term Frequency) describes above indicates how often a particu-
lar word appears in a document. It means the higher the value, the more critical the
word. However, a term commonly used (for example, do) may have a high TF value
even though it is not an important word. To avoid this, we can measure how many
documents appear in a text by Document Frequency (DF). In conclusion, TF-IDF
(Inverse Document Frequency) provides information to determine how valuable a
word is in a particular document based on word frequency and document frequency.
The value of the weight, in general, marks the TF-IDF. This Eq. 1 of the TF-IDF score
is calculated as follows.

tf ; ;= The number of occurrences of i in j; df, = The number of documents containing i;
N=total number of documents.

Weight is the link frequency of generated word pairs, meaning that the words of ‘stu-
dent’ and ‘experience’ weight 28, and the word pair appears 28 times in the entire text. #
of Sentences/Paragraphs/Documents is the number of sentences/paragraphs/documents
in which the word pair appears. In this study, the word pair of ‘learning’ and ‘environ-
ment’ appear 26 times, with a weight of 26 and # of documents of 19. Gini Coefficient
indicates how concentrated the word pair is intensely in a few sentences, paragraphs,
and documents. It is also how evenly it appears in multiple sentences, paragraphs, and
documents. A value closer to 1 demonstrates that the more focused it is on a few sen-
tences, paragraphs, and documents, the more important the word pair is. In this case,
the criterion for sentences, paragraphs, and documents is a co-occurrence unit selected
when creating a 1-mode network.

Lastly, the method of LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which is a machine learn-
ing algorithm, is used to extract subtopics embedded in the text [10, 54]. LDA is one
of the most popular and influential topic models, a method for analyzing a broad set of
unstructured documents. The basic idea is that unstructured documents are represented
as a topic distribution where each topic is characterized by a word distribution [12, 54).

We can denote p(zld,), p(wlz;;) as the topic distribution for each document i, and the
word distribution for a topic allocated to jth word of document i, respectively. In the
learning phase, LDA fits p(zld;), p(wlz,;) to a pair of documents (i.e., a document-by-
word sparse matrix). Given these distributions, the LDA can generate a new document
with the following generative process [12]:

for jth word in the ith document:

Choose a topic z; ;~ Multinomial (p(zld;))

Choose a topic w, ;~ Multinomial (p(wlz;,)).

For each topic, the top nodes from the main nodes show in Table 4. Moreover, this
table shows the number of nodes and probability included for each topic when the clas-
sification labels of nodes in a Subnodeset are assigned to the topic that maximizes the
topic proportion from ‘SubNode:

MainNode (it is a Keyword) and SubNode (it is a Document) show probability infor-
mation about which topic to associate. Using this method, we can figure out that the
more similar the values of the response variables are, the more likely they are to contain
compatible subjects. In contrast, the more significant the differences between them, the
more likely they are to include different topics. The results of the top 3-topic modeling,
according to the # of documents, show as follows. The main subject of the first topic can
be interpreted as that practice and learning assessment can be achieved through various
activities such as community activities. The second topic suggests that students’ college
education can also reach through experience-based classes as staff. Third, the supervi-
sor’s research may indicate that subjects in academic contexts can be addressed. In addi-
tion to that, several issues are revealed as uprising topics through the topic modeling of

Implication and conclusion

This study aspires to grasp the latest research agendas and academic trends in teach-
ing and learning with the keywords of major international journals in higher education
through semantic network analysis. Consequently, it turns out that this study obviously
provides educators, researchers, and academic leaders with data-empowered insights
and intuition. The identifiable future agendas, such as a trend-based approach in teach-
ing, learning, and research in higher education, will guide future education with right
direction. In this regard, this study outlines the significant implications as follows.

First of all, the world is changing faster than ever; accordingly, it is not easy to fol-
low up on the current educational trends in higher education by mastering whole agen-
das. Most academic members do not adapt as quickly to keep them up-to-date in the
double loop with strategic agility. Given that, this study allows us to identify the cur-
rent flow of education and educational issues at a glance by leveraging advanced tech-
nology and big data. This study focuses on the most recent 2 years of big research data
to best support this current situation rather than looking at old panel data such as ten
or twenty-year past data. Recent big data generated by reputable publishers’ web data-
base platforms and analytics has become an essential component for the higher edu-

cation sector. In this way, this research reflects best the current educational situations

in teaching and learning of higher education and contribute to preparing for the future
with data-empowered intuitions and insights.

Secondly, the semantic network analysis method, a data-driven approach used in this
paper, may shed light on the development of new techniques using the machine learn-
ing algorithm to get the whole picture of a new paradigm or shift in higher education.
It proves that this is a very effective and useful tool to understand the key attributes of
current flow and network map in teaching and learning thoroughly by extracting main
issues and associated sub-topics. In this regard, this study enhances a more objective
view of the actual educational reality and phenomena through big data and machine
learning models in the educational sector entirely.

Lastly, traditionally, ‘teacher-centered’ or ‘teacher-led’ education in teaching and learn-
ing was the central theme in higher education. A teacher or instructor mainly focused
on delivering entire contents from his or her side to students unilaterally. However, now,
the paradigm is wholly changed into ‘student-centered’ or ‘student-led’ education. Then,
various issues, such as learning, education, research, and experience that follow inciden-
tally, are broken down and spread to diverse subjects. This study firmly reflects in this
modern paradigm and educational trend quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore,
this research result will play a critical role in reshaping educational environments and
critical perspectives on teaching and learning in higher education placed on big data.

Although this research suggests several substantial and critical implications, there are
still some limitations to be improved below. It will address in future research.

In this study, 285 scholarly articles from the top-ranked international journals related
to teaching and learning in 2018-2019 were gathered and analyzed to recognize the
most recent research agendas and trends, as it intended, intends to see only up-to-date
data given that the trend is changing quickly. However, it is a fact that studies using mas-
sive data improve the results in terms of the level of validity and reliability of analysis in
general, and it still works in the academic world. Accordingly, future research is needed
to collect more data by increasing the number of articles on teaching and learning.

Next, the semantic network analysis or semantic mining technique performs statisti-
cal, logical, and rule-based semantic networks analysis quantitatively and qualitatively.
However, the research method still leaves room for consideration. Traditional network
analysis techniques analyzed physical world relationships simply based on distance
(such as centrality), strength, direction, etc. However, recently network analysis has been
developed continuously. The giant network is continually forming and flowing subse-
quent knowledge as large as 1: N link for real-time communication through social media
such as Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube, etc. Thus, it should notice that recent net-
work analysis is very complicated, like the social network web, with a vast amount of
data flowing through the network structure. Also, it is necessary to derive and analyze
sub-networks aiming to apply them to diverse sectors by reflecting those attributes of a
network into the research world.

Lastly, approaching individually or together with a holistic perspective in different
education sectors such as law, engineering, business, computer science, or any other
studies in higher education is worth doing for future research. The discovery and com-
parison of the most recent issues or keywords on teaching and learning in each field of
higher education will help drive innovation and change in teaching and learning entirely.

Furthermore, it encourages academic leaders, more senior or higher management teams,
to have effective and proactive leadership by realizing the trend-based education and fol-
lowing up the future directions.
