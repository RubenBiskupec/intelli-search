Abstract

Energy-efficient transmission (EET) has become a very important problem in wireless
communication. Optimal power allocation (OPA) is one of the general methods to
achieve EET. But when OPA is only considered in EET, it maybe cannot analyze EET
problems accurately. This paper aims at analyzing energy-efficient bidirectional direct
and relay transmission (RT) through joint optimization of transmit power (TP) and
transmit time (TT) allocation. In RT, direct links (DLs) are existed. The EET problems are
given with three optimization cases: (i) maximizing sum throughput (ST) to maximize
energy efficiency (EE), in such case, optimal TT (OTT), optimal relay position (ORP), and
outage probability analysis are given; (ii) minimizing total energy consumption (TEC) to
maximize EE, in such case, optimal TP (OTP), OTT with gradient-descent algorithm, and
influences of asymmetry and asymmetry transmission tasks are given; and (iii)
maximizing ST and minimizing TEC simultaneously to maximize EE, in such case,
Dinkelbach’s algorithm and one-by-one optimal algorithm are given. Simulation results
are presented to validate theoretical analysis. Results reveal that relay technique and
DLs in RT can improve system’s EE.

Keywords: Energy efficiency, Direct links, Optimal transmit time, Optimal transmit
power, Optimal relay position

 

1 Introduction

With rapid development of wireless communication, traditional communication system
cannot satisfy the requirement of green communication and spectrum resources shortage
[1, 2]. A large amount of interests have been focused on improving energy efficiency (EE)
and spectral efficiency (SE). At the same time, lots of works have been done with different
transmission techniques to improve them separately or simultaneously, such as cognitive
radio [3, 4], orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [5], multi antenna tech-
nique [6], millimeter wave technique [7], simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) technique [8, 9], and non-orthogonal multiple access [10, 11]. Among
all of these techniques, relay technique has attracted a lot of attention for achieving spa-
tial diversity [12]. The major existing relay protocols are amplify-and-forward (AF) and
decode-and-forward (DF). In AF relay protocol, relay node simply amplifies and forwards
the received signal without any decoding operation [13]. Also, AF relay protocol is easy

for implementation since it only requires coarse synchronization [14]. Therefore, AF relay
protocol is considered in this paper.

With relay technique, energy-efficient transmission (EET) can be achieved. Energy-
efficient resource allocation has been investigated in [15], which demonstrated that
system EE can be maximized by scheduling optimal numbers of relay antennas and corre-
sponding relay transmit power (TP). Optimal power allocation (OPA) scheme in a cooper-
ative relaying system has been investigated in [16], which suggested that optimal global EE
is strictly quasi-concave with regard to TP. With relay technique, spectral-efficient trans-
mission (SET) can also be achieved. Optimal rate allocation scheme has been proposed
in [17], and it found that system’s error-free SET can be achieved. Energy-and-spectral-
efficient adaptive forwarding strategy for multi-hop device-to-device communications
overlaying cellular networks has been proposed in [18], and it found that the higher EE
and SE can be achieved.

However, only OPA has been considered in [15, 16] and only ideal network environment
has been considered in [17, 18] to achieve EET. Actually, joint optimization of transmit
time (TT) and TP allocation can be more accurately to measure system’s energy con-
sumption and more effectively to improve system's EE. Considering the joint optimization
concern, energy-efficient relay-assisted cellular network has been studied in [19], which
aimed at minimizing total power consumption through joint optimization of TT and TP
allocation, and EE comparisons among direct transmission (DT), one-way relay transmis-
sion (OWRT), and two-way relay transmission (TWRT) with consideration of optimal
TT (OTT) and optimal TP (OTP) have been discussed in [20]. It should be noted that
the TWRT in [20] transmitted signal with the two-phase analog network coding (ANC)
protocol. At the same time, in practical transmission systems, energy consumption does
include not only TP, but also non-negligible circuit powers (CPs). In addition, the power
amplifier (PA) efficiency is usually not ideal. The CP consumption and non-ideal PA effi-
ciency are all for non-ideal network environment. Considering the non-ideal network
environment concern, throughput optimal policies for energy harvesting transmitters
with CP consumption have been studied in [21], and EE maximization of full-duplex
(FD) two-way DF relay with PA efficiency and CP consumption has been discussed in
[22]. While considering the above two concerns, EE analysis of relay systems with joint
consideration of TP, TT, and CPs has been discussed in [23].

However, again, direct links (DLs) in relay transmission (RT) have not been considered
in [19-23] with assumption of deeply fading channel. Actually, consideration of DLs that
are existed in RT can achieve further SE performance gain, and some works have been
done on it. For example, cellular communication scenario involving the coexistence of
one-hop DT and two-hop relaying has been studied in [24], optimal source and relay
design for multiuser MIMO AF relay communication system with DLs and imperfect
channel state information (CSI) has been investigated in [25], EE optimization for a two-
hop AF relay network with DLs over Rayleigh fading channels has been considered in
[26], RT considering DLs and aiming at maximizing EE has been discussed in [27], and
the optimization for energy-efficient FD transmissions with DLs has been studied in our
recent work [28]. As for the comparisons between the half-duplex and FD technique of the
related works, they have been given in [28]. It has been shown that the FD technique can
increase the SE and EE of the system, but only the minimizing total energy consumption
(TEC) case has been discussed in [27, 28].

At the same time, optimal relay position (ORP) problem is important in RT for it influ-
ences the system performance. Although it has been showed that the ORP in a general
communication system is the relay node located at the middle of two source nodes, it still
can be a open problem. To the best of our knowledge, there are fewer works that investi-
gate the ORP problem from the perspective of maximizing EE, i.e., the problem of joint
optimization of relay station positions and relay stations serving range for maximizing EE
has been discussed in [29].

Considering all of the above concerns and comparing with existing work in the lit-
eratures, whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1, this paper investigates the
energy-efficient DT and RT problems. The main contributions of this paper can be

summarized as follows:

e Firstly, to achieve a more pratical EET in this paper, PA efficiency, CP consumption,
DLs in RT, and joint optimization of TT and TP allocation are considered
simultaneously, rather than only considering parts of them in existing work. At the
same time, ORP problem is investigated from the perspective of maximizing EE for
the system EE can be improved with ORP [29]. This problem also has not been
considered in the most of existing work.

e Secondly, to achieve a more comprehensive EE analysis in this paper, EET problems
are given with three optimization cases, i.e., maximizing sum throughput (ST) to
maximize EE, minimizing TEC to maximize EE, and maximizing ST and minimizing
TEC simultaneously to maximize EE, rather than only considering minimizing TEC
to maximize EE in [19] and [22, 23], or only considering maximizing ST to
maximizing EE in [18] and [29, 30].

e Thirdly, with the three optimization cases: (1) OTT, ORP, and outage probability
analysis are given with maximizing ST to maximize EE; (2) OTP, OTT with
gradient-descent algorithm, and influences of asymmetry and asymmetry
transmission tasks are given with minimizing TEC to maximize EE; (3) Dinkelbach’s
algorithm and one-by-one optimal algorithm are given with maximizing ST and

minimizing TEC simultaneously to maximize EE.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system model.
Section 3 provides the throughput analysis, energy consumption model, and problem for-
mulation. Sections 4, 5, and 6 presents the three optimization cases to maximize EE.

Section 7 gives simulation results and followed by conclusions in Section 8.

In this section, the models of bidirectional DT and RT are explained. In DT, there are

two source nodes S and S9. In RT, there is also a relay node R except for two source

nodes S; and Sy. At the same time, the relay node R lies between two source nodes S; and
S». To achieve a bidirectional transmission, it needs two time slots in DT, it needs four
time slots in OWRT, and it needs three time slots in TWRT. The relay protocol is AF,
and nodes’ work mode is half-duplex. The links experience independent block Rayleigh
fading and remain unchanged during one block. The following optimization and anal-
ysis are based on one block duration T;. The transmission signal for the node Sj is x;
with variance E{x,7} = 1, and the transmission signal for the node Sp is x2 with vari-
ance E{x)”} = 1. The TP for the node S; is P,, and the TP for the node S> is Py. The
channel gain between the nodes S, and S> is 43, the channel gain between the nodes S
and R is 4,, and the channel gain between the nodes S» and R is hp. At the same time,
the channel gains between the same two nodes are all reciprocal, and the nodes have the
full CSI. The noise at the node Sj is 11, the noise at the node S9 is m9, and the noise at
the node R is n,. Meanwhile, the DLs between two source nodes S; and S> in RT are
existed and they can be exploited to convey information [25]. The noises are zero-mean
symmetric complex Gaussian vector with variance 1. The system bandwidth is W. The
receive signals are combined at two nodes S; and Sy by maximum ratio combining (MRC)
technique.

The DT model is shown in Fig. 1a. In the first time slot, source node S; transmits signal
x1 to node So, and the receive signal at node S» is ya = ./Ph3x, +n». In the second time
slot, source node S2 transmits signal x2 to node Sj, and the receive signal at node S; is
yt = /Pyh3x2 + m1.

The OWRT model is shown in Fig. 1b. In the first time slot, source node Sj, trans-
mits signal x; to node R and So, and the receive signals at node R and S2 are respectively
yt, = VP hx. + ny and y§ = /Pih3x1 + nz. In the second time slot, relay node R
amplifies and forwards the receive signals y{, to node S2, and the receive signal at node
So is Wry = JPy2h2x1~ + N2, where P, is relay node’s TP in the second time slot of
OWRT, x1; is node R amplifies and forwards signal in the second time slot of OWRT

with x1, = A1j{,, Ai is amplify coefficients and A, ~ Tene [31]. In the third time
slot, source node S2 transmits signal x2 to node R and Sj, and the receive signals at
relay node R and Sy; are respectively y§,, = /Pohox. + n, and y? = /P2h3x2 + 11.

The TWRT model is shown in Fig. 1c, and it transmits signal with the three-phase ANC
protocol. The three-phase ANC protocol is also called time division broadcast channel
(TDBC) protocol as [31] suggested. In the first time slot, source node S, transmits signal
x1 to node R and S9, and the receive signals at node R and Sy are respectively y|. = y{,
and 5 = y5. In the second time slot, source node S2 transmits signal x2 to node R and Sj,
and the receive signals at relay node R and S; are respectively y,, = y$, andy, = y. In the
third time slot, relay node R broadcasts x; to nodes S; and S), where x, = Cy, + C295,
is node R amplifies and forwards signal of TWRT. ¢; and ¢2 are forward coefficients,
where ¢] sine and f2 * rae 0, and 02 can be seemed as the signal combining
factors, and they determine how relay node R combines the two signals y/,, and ys, where
O < {01,02} < 1 and 0; + 02 = 1 [31]. The original receive signals of TWRT yt,’ and
yt’ can be expressed as yt’ = ./P,hx; +n, and yey’ = J/P,hox; + n2, where P, is relay
node’s TP in TWRT. Since each of source node receives a copy of its own transmitted
signal as interference, the signal transmitted from the other source node can be decoded
after self-interference cancellation (SIC). Finally, the receive signals at the nodes S; and
Sy can be respectively expressed as yy = /P,h, (f2./Pohox2 + ony + Cony) + n, and
og = VPyho (61./Pihyx1 + Cin; + bony) + no.

3 Throughput analysis, energy consumption model, and problem formulation
In this section, throughput analysis is given first, followed by the energy consumption
model and problem formulation.

3.1 Throughput analysis

In this subsection, throughput analysis is given. As we have suggested in the system
model, one block duration is T; and within which a round of bidirectional transmission is
accomplished [22].

In DT and OWRT, T; and T> can be used to represent TT from node S, to So
and from node Sz to Sj, respectively. With throughput definition in [22], yf, and yf,
throughput of DT can be given by Cg = Cy, + Cg,, where Cy is ST of DT, Cy, =
T, W log, (1+ ya,) is throughput at node Sz of DT, and Cg, = T2:W log, (1+ ya,) is
throughput at node S; of DT. yg, and yg, are signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at nodes S2 and
S, of DT, respectively. With noise variance is 1, they can be given by yg, = P1|/3|? and
Vay = Po\h3\*.

With y5, 75, yf, and y?,, throughput of OWRT can be given by Cy, = Cy, + Co,, where Cy
is ST of OWRT, Co, = a W log, (1 + Yo,) is throughput at node Sz of OWRT, and C,, =
2 W log, (1 + Yoo) is throughput at node S, of OWRT. The 1/2 is due to two time slots
in completing a transmission process in each direction. y,, and y,, are respectively SNRs

In TWRI, Tiy; can be used to represent TT for the whole information exchange. With

ST of TWRIT, Cy, = Foe W log, (1 + y,) is throughput at node S) of TWRT, and C;, =

3.2 Energy consumption model

In this subsection, the TEC model is given. It should be noted that the TEC con-
tains TPs and CPs. To reduce the TEC, the system may not use entire block dura-
tion 7; for transmission. In each block, each node has three states: transmission,
reception, and idle [32], which corresponding to CP consumptions of three states
are respectively P, P, and P“. For node Sj, So, and R all have three kinds of
CP consumptions, we use subscript: ¢€ {1,2,r} to represent nodes Sj), S, and R,
respectively. In such case, the CPs of three nodes with three states can be expressed
as P“, P*, and P*, respectively. Also, the SIC in TWRT needs to consume CPs
P*“, In such case, the CP consumptions for SIC of nodes S; and Sy in TWRT can
be expressed as psc and sic, respectively. The non-ideal PA efficiency is uw and
ye = 1 [33].

From the above illustrations, the TEC is related to TPs, CPs, and PA efficiency, and TT
can be known. Then, the TEC in DT is Eg = Ty (uP + Pa, — Poci) + T2(uP2 + Pay —
Poci) + TrPpdcis where Pq, = Po + PS and Py. = Ps + Pt" represent total CPs in the first
and second time slots of DT, respectively. T; = T; + Ty + T’ in DT and OWRT, where T’
is the time in idle state. Pog = pe — Pe represents total idle CP in DT.

The TEC in OWRT is Eo = (4°32) 4 7,,—Prci) +
Ty (HP FPA) + Py — Pror) + TePreir where Po, = 3 (Pit + Pel + Pe” + Pet + PY + Pil)

and Py, = 5 (PS + PU + P7 + Pt +P? +P“) represent total CPs in the first and
second two time slots of OWRT, respectively. Proj = pe — Pe — pe represents total idle

CP in RT.
The TEC in TWRT is E; = Try ( wPvteat Pa) + Pry + Pig + Pics — Prci) +
T:Prcis where P;, = 4% (PU+PS +P"), Pi. = 4(P+P0+P’), and hi, =

: (Poh + PY + PY + psc + PS) represent total CPs in the first, second, and third time
slot, and Ty = Tyyy + T’ in TWRT.

3.3 Problem formulation

In this subsection, EE definition and problem formulation are given. The EE in this paper
is defined the same as [34], and it can be given as n = ee, where C7 is ST and E7 is TEC.
From the throughput analysis and energy consumption model, it can be known that both
Er and Cyr have relations with TPs and TT, and we need to maximize it by maximizing
Cr and minimizing E; with OTP and OTT. Thus, energy-efficient optimization problem

can be summarized as

max (Cr,Er). (1)
Cr.Er

For a more comprehensive analysis, we divide the optimization problem into three opti-
mization cases. Firstly, maximizing C7 to maximize n when TPs are equally allocated as
[29, 30]. Secondly, minimizing E7 to maximize n when C7 is constant as [22, 23]. Thirdly,
maximizing C7; and minimizing Ey simultaneously to maximize n. The EE analysis of

these three cases will be given in the following three sections.

4 Maximize sum throughput

Firstly, when TPs are equally allocated, which means Py = P2 = P,1 = P,2 = P, = P,
we try to maximize C7 with OTT to maximize 7. TPs equally allocation is usually existed
in practical system for simplicity, ie., IS-95-CDMA system [35]. At the same time, the
throughput is an important index that the communication systems want to pursue. Thus,
the discussion about maximizing Cy to maximize n with TPs equally allocation maybe
can effectively improve the EE of the IS-95-CDMA system under a certain situation.

4.1 Optimal transmit time

In this subsection, the OTT analysis is given. It should be noted that all the CPs are a
fixed power cost from 0 to hundreds of mW [36]. However, although the CPs are a fixed
power cost, they are concerned with TT. Then, we need to maximize Cy through OTT to
maximize 7. In such case, Propositions 1 and 2 about OTT to maximize 7 can be obtained.

Proposition 1 When P, = Py = P,, = Py. = P, = P and different nodes’ CPs for
transmit, receive, and idle are the same, i.e., pe = PS, PY = Py’, and pe = PS, the OTT
in DT and OWRT to maximize n is T’ = 0.

Proof: With Py = Py = Py, = P,y = P;, = P and different nodes’ CPs are the same
constants, Yo, = Yo, and Py, = Po.. = Po, can be obtained. Then, C, = At W log, (1+
Yo,) and E, = (uP+ Po,)(T1 + To) + (Tt — Ti — T2)Prej can be further obtained. In such
case, EE of OWRT ny can be given as

ATE W log, (1 + Yo,)
(UP + Po.)(T1 + T2) + (Tt — Ti — T2)PRei
5 W logy(1 + yo,)
bP + Pog + (atin; — 1) Pre
W logy(1 + Yo)
2(uP + Py.)

No =

i

The (a) step is for dividing T; + T2, and (b) step is for T; + Ty = T; and T’ = 0 to
maximize n,. The same conclusion of the OTT in DT is T’ = 0 can also be obtained with
Py = Po = Py = Py = P, = Pand Pas = Pas = Pa. to maximize EE of DT Nd:

The proof is completed. [|

 

Proposition 2 When Py = Pp = Py, = P;2 = P, = P, the OTT in TWRT to maximize
n is also T’ = 0.
Cai et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:156 Page 8 of 26

Proof: With Py = Pp = Py, = Py2 = P, = P, EE of TWRT 7; can be given as

owe and (b) step is for Tjy, = T; and T’ = 0 to maximize 7.

 

The (a) step is for dividing
The proof is completed. O

Remark 1: [t should be noted that comparing with DT and OWRT, the OTT in TWRT to
maximize n; has no constraints for CPs. At the same time, the OTT in it is always Try; = T;
when TPs are not functions of TT even with unequally power allocation.

4.2 Optimal relay position
In this subsection, ORP analysis is given. Considering the Rayleigh fading channel, when
three nodes are in a line and the distances of two source nodes between relay node are
normalized by the distance between two source nodes S; and S2, the channel gains can be
expressed as |h3|* = 1, |f,|7 = d~%, d € (0,1), and |h2|* = (1 — d)~% [31], where d is the
distance between node S, and R, a is the path loss attenuation factor, and @ €[ 2,5] [37].
From (2), we can see that only y,, is needed to be maximized with ORP to maximize 7,
when T’ = 0. Then, Proposition 3 about ORP in OWRT can be obtained.

Proposition 3 When P, = Pp = P,, = P;y = P, = P and T' = 0, the ORP in OWRT to

maximize No is d = 0.5.

Proof: With Py = Py = Py, = Py2 = P, = P, T’ = 0, Aj, and channel gains, y,, can be

reformulated as
ad “(1—d)*
— 4
You (+ oe) 4)
d“(-dy*  — Vd “(1-dy™ _
2

With (4), when d = 0.5, yo, can achieve the maximum for dcay4ae7 ©

os. This means that 7, is the maximum when d = 0.5 for in such case yo, is the
maximum.
The proof is completed. O

From (3), we can also know that only the sum SNR of TWRT y = Vx, + Vip + Vee ep iS
needed to be maximized with ORP to maximize n; when T’ = 0. However, it also should
be noted that comparing with OWRT, the 01 and 02 will influence y,, and ;,. Then,
Proposition 4 about optimal 0, 02, and ORP in TWRT can be obtained.

Proposition 4 When P, = P2 = P,, = P»2 = P; = P and T' = 0, the optimal 0}, 09,
and ORP in TWRT to maximize nz are 0, = 02 = 0.5 and d is smaller.

Proof: Please see the Appendix: Proof of Proposition 4.
Cai et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:156 Page 9 of 26

The proof is completed. O

4.3 Outage probability analysis
In this subsection, outage probability analysis is given for it is an important criterion to
measure the performance of a link. With Cy, to avoid disruption for a given through-
put, then C;.) < Cy, denotes the outage event, and Pr(C(.) < Cy,) denotes the outage
probability.

Let y = Py = Po = Py = Pp = P, = P, Cq can be reformulated as

Cq = (T) + T2)W log, (1 + y|h3|"). (5)

It should be noted that bidirectional transmission system is in outage if any end-to-end

transmission is in outage. The outage event of DT is given by min{Cy,, Cag, } < Cy, and it
Cr

is equivalent to the event \h3|2 < aon, where Tin = min{T}, T7>}in DT and OWRT.
Statistically, the variances of channel gains / are br. For Rayleigh fading, i.e., |/;|? are
exponentially distribution with parameter 5? [38], where subscript / € {1, 2,3} represent
different channel gains. Then, A; = 4, 2 Ag = 65 > and A3 = b3 * can be obtained. Also,
when x tends to 0, an equivalent infinitesimal approximation 1—e * ~ x can be obtained.
With them, outage probability of DT p§™ can be calculated as

[22]. Minimizing TEC is one of the widely used methods to achieve green communication
[1]. At the same time, the OPA has been widely studied in many practical wireless sys-
tems, i.e., with OPA to achieve EET of cellular system [19] and with OPA to maximize the
average throughput and EE of energy harvesting system [21]. Thus, the discussion about
the minimizing E7 to maximize 7 with joint optimization of TT and TP allocation maybe

can effectively improve the EEs of the cellular and energy harvesting systems.

5.1 Energy-efficient direct transmission
In this subsection, the problem with minimizing Ez to maximize ng is given. With the
requirements of C;, C2, maximum TP P;"**, and total TT T;, EET in DT can be given as

follows:
min Ey (17a)
P,,P2,T1,T2
s.t. O < {P1,P2} < P*,0 < {T}, To}, (17b)
Ti + To < T1,Cg, > Ci,and Cg, > Co. (17c)

Through throughputs, the TPs can be expressed as functions of TT, then the minimum
TECs can be obtained with only optimizing TT. For throughputs are derived from Shan-
non capacity formula, which means the maximum achievable throughput can be obtained
under given TPs, thus, the TPs derived through throughputs are also the minimum which

can support the required transmission tasks.

With Cy, = Ci, gmiv — 1 = yg, can be obtained. At the same time, with Cg, = Co,

minimum TPs in DT can be obtained as

(18)

It can be seen that the optimal pve and psPe are respectively increasing functions of
Yd, and yg,; thus, they are respectively decreasing functions of T; and T. As T; and T>
decrease, the optimal pyre and psPe increase, and they may achieve P;"*“. To simplify the
analysis, we only consider all the TPs that will not achieve P;"** situation, and the TPs that

situation can be seen in our recent work [27].

With (18), the (17) can be reformulated into only optimizing TT problem and it can be

given by

convex functions can be solved using standard solvers, such as inter-point methods, New-
ton method, and gradient-descent method. For the fast convergence of gradient-descent
algorithm [39], we use it in this paper. For each ¢;, the gradient-descent algorithm can be
summarized as Algorithm 1.

In Algorithm 1, we give an initial point t; €[0, 7;]. Then, it iteratively moves toward
lower values of the functions by taking steps in direction of negative gradient — vf (t;)
with chosen step size ;, and—v/f (¢;) can be obtained according to (19a), (23a), (23b), and
(26a). Eventually, Algorithm 1 converges to the minimum for the functions are convex.

5.2 Energy-efficient one-way relay transmission

In this subsection, with minimizing E, to maximize 7, problem is given. The EET in
OWRT can also be given under the requirements of Cj, C2, P/“, and T;. Observ-
ing E,, it can be found that the terms E,, = Tj (ueipPaa) + Po. Prci) and E,, =

T;Prcj is independent of TT. To make a further observation, it can be found that y,, is
not a function of Pz and P,;, while y,, is not a function of P; and P,2. Therefore, the opti-
mization problem in OWRT can be equivalently reformulated into two subproblems as

With Ei (Trwr) = 0, E; that is a convex function of Ty; can be known. Then, the problem
can be solved with Algorithm 1. The complexities of Algorithm 1 are O(Zg, + Zg,) in DT,
O(Zg,; + Lq,) in OWRT, and O(Zz,) in TWRT. The Zz, and Zg, are respectively required
number of iterations for T; and T2 in DT. The Zz, and Zy, are respectively required num-
ber of iterations for 7; and T2 in OWRT, and the Zg, is the required number of iterations
for Tyr in TWRT. In order to get the OTT, the complexity can be modeled in polyno-
mial form in terms of the number of variables and constraints with the functions (19a),
(23a), (23b), and (26a). Then, for each OTT, it mainly needs one derivation in step 3 and
its complexity is O(1).

Remark 2: There is a pity that the analytic expression of OTT cannot be obtained for the
existence of exponential terms of TT; and that is why we use Algorithm 1 to get the OTT in
this section.

5.4 Asymmetry and asymmetry transmission tasks

In this subsection, the influences of asymmetry and asymmetry transmission tasks at
two directions are given. With 6 to show the transmission task distribution factor at two
directions, Proposition 5 can be obtained.

Proposition 5 When Cr is constant and different nodes’ CPs for transmit, receive, and
idle are the same, B influences ny and the maximum 1; can be obtained when B = 0.
However, B does not influence ng and no.

Proof: Please see the Appendix: Proof of Proposition 5.
The proof is completed. O

6 Maximize energy efficiency

Thirdly, we try to maximize C7 and minimize Ey simultaneously to maximize n with the
proposed optimal algorithms. Maximizing EE is a more scientific method to achieve green
communication, and many communication techniques have been studied to improve the
EEs of different wireless communication systems, i.e., the MIMO system [1, 32]. Thus,
the discussion about maximizing C7 and minimizing Ey simultaneously to maximize 7

maybe also can effectively improve the EE of the MIMO system.
Cai et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:156 Page 15 of 26

Actually, the proposed optimal algorithms in this section can also be used in the
communication systems when the multiple optimal variables cannot be obtained simul-
taneously [40]. The usage of the proposed optimal algorithms in the communication
systems with multiple optimal variables is only to try to show its application in the exist-
ing works, and the further detailed discussions about whether the usage can improve the
performance of the related systems can be studied in the further work. This is the same
as Sections 4 and 5 with the application of their solutions in the related systems.

6.1 Energy-efficiency maximization optimal algorithms

In this subsection, EE maximization optimal algorithms are given. First, maximizing 7; is
given for we have proved in Remark 1: that the OTT in it is always T;,, = T; when the
TPs are not functions of TT. Then maximizing 7; problem is only concerned with TPs.
With (3) and the optimization constraints of (24), maximizing 7; problem can be given as

max = 27a

In (27), n¢ is non-convex in (P, P;) for the numerator of n; is concave and the denom-
inator of 7; is linear with respect to P and P,, respectively. At the same time, 7; is
differentiable; thus, it is pseudo-concave in terms of P and P,, respectively. Since for any
optimization problems, we can first optimize over some of the variables and then over the
remaining ones [40]. Then, we can divide it into two sub-optimization problems which
optimizing P and P, in alternative. The pseudo-concave properties can be proved with
Hessians of them, ie., 777;(P) < O and 727; (P,) < 0.

For the pseudo-concave properties of 7, it can be seemed as oe where f (x) is concave
and g(x) is linear. Define the function F(y) as F(w) = maxyes{f(*) — wg(x)} with con-
tinuous and positive f, g, and compact S, then F(y) is convex with respect to w; also, it is
strictly decreasing and it has a unique root y*. With it, the problem of finding F(y) can be

solved with convex optimization approaches and it is shown that the problem of maximiz-
L(x)
(x)
been divided into two sub-optimization problems, it can be solved one-by-one. For each

ing is equivalent to finding w* [36]. At the same time, since the original problem has
x, Dinkelbach’s algorithm is employed for its properties in solving non-convex fractional
programming problems. Dinkelbach’s algorithm can be summarized as Algorithm 2,
where the superscript (7) denotes the iteration number.

Algorithm 3 leads to global optimal values of each pseudo-concave function. In this
regard, for TWRT, firstly, with P™, Algorithm 2 is adopted in order to find pry,
Secondly, with known PT), Path ig computed. Consequently, the one-by-one opti-
mal algorithm is required in order to optimize P and P,, simultaneously. Algorithm 3
presents the one-by-one optimal alternating procedure which updates the optimization
parameters until convergence.

Second, maximizing ng and 7. problems are given. With Cg(P1, P2, 71,72),
Eq(P1, P2, T1, Tz), and the optimization constraints of (17), maximizing ng problem can

6.2 Complexity analysis
In this subsection, the complexity analysis of the optimal algorithms is given. To analyze
the computational complexity of Algorithm 3, we should note that Algorithm 3 employs

Algorithm 2. But it also should be noted that the convergence rate of Algorithm 2 is inde-

pendent of the complexity of finding x5,

mial form in terms of the number of variables and constraints. With these properties, we
analyze the complexity of Algorithm 3 for DT, OWRT, and TWRIT, respectively.
The complexities for step 4 and step 5 are O(1), and the total complexity of one iteration

for its super linear convergence. As the problems

of finding x,,, in Algorithm 3 are convex, their complexity can be modeled in polyno-

of Algorithm 3 for DT is O(Zqg, + Za,), where Zz, and Zy, are respectively the required
number of iterations for step 4 and step 5. The complexities from step 8 to step 11 are
O(1), and the total complexity of one iteration of Algorithm 3 for OWRT is O(Zg, +
Lag + Lay) + La,,), where Ly,, Zq,, La,), and Ly,, are respectively the required number
of iterations for step 8, step 9, step 10, and step 11. The complexities for step 14 and
step 15 are O(1), and the total complexity of one iteration of Algorithm 3 for TWRT is
O(Zq,, + La,3), where Zyz,, and Zy,, are respectively the required number of iterations for
step 14 and step 15.

allocated. In Fig. 2, EEs with and without idle state are given which correspond to T’ = 1ms
and T’ =0, respectively. The with and without idle state corresponds to “w” and “w/o” in
Fig. 2, respectively. From it, we can find that EEs when T’ = 1 ms are lower than those
when 7’ =0, which corresponds to Propositions 1 and 2 that the OTT both in DT and RT
to maximize EE is T’ = 0.

In Fig. 3, EEs with different 0; in TWRT are given. With it, two results can be found:
(i) EE of TWRT when 0; = 0.1 is the same as when 0; = 0.9, and EE of TWRT when
01 = 0.25 is the same as when 0; = 0.75; (ii) EE of TWRT when 0; = 0.5 is the maximum.
These have been proved in Proposition 4 for f’(0,) < 0 and f’(0.5) = 0, which means
the EE of TWRT is the maximum when 0, = 0.5. In Fig. 3, EEs of DT and OWRT, and EE
of relay transmission with none of DL (RT-NDL) which corresponding to one-way relay

system in [23] are also given. From it, we can know that EEs with DLs in RT are higher
than those of RT-NDL, which shows the effectiveness of DLs in RT for its SE performance
gain.

In Fig. 4, EEs of RT with different d are given. In Fig. 4a, it can be found that EE of
OWRT is the maximum when relay node lies in the middle of two source nodes, which
has been proved in Proposition 3 for in such case yp, is the maximum. In Fig. 4b, it can
be found that the smaller the d the higher the EE of TWRIT, which also has been proved
in Proposition 4 for in such case }; is bigger.

In Fig. 5, outage probabilities are given. The simulation results of outage probabilities
are obtained with (6), (11) and (16). From Fig. 5, it can be found that outage performance
of TWRT is the best and DT is the worst. This is because with the given Cy, to avoid
disruption, the ST of TWRT is the best and ST of DT is the worst.

7.2 Minimize total energy consumption

In this subsection, EEs with minimizing E7 are given. At the same time, TPs are optimally
allocated. In Fig. 6, EEs when T’ = 1 msand T’ = Oare given. The JT’ = 1 ms corresponds
to the DT, OWRT, and TWRT with idle state, and it means the system can transfer into
idle state when the transmission tasks have been completed. The T’ = 0 ms corresponds
to the DT, OWRT, and TWRT without idle state, and it means the system always uses the
entail block duration for transmission. The with and without idle states correspond to “w”
and “w/o” in the Fig. 6, respectively. From Fig. 6, the following results can be found: (i)

EEs when T” = 0 are lower than those when T’ = 1 ms when transmission rate is low; (ii)
EEs when T’ = 0 are equal to those when JT’ = 1 ms when transmission rate is high. This
is because when the transmission task is low and it has been completed, the without idle
mode still uses entail block duration T; for transmission. In such case, TPs and other CPs,
such as transmit and receive CPs, keep consuming. However, the with idle mode changes
to the idle mode. In such case, TPs and other CPs can be saved even with idle CPs increase.
However, idle CPs are smaller than TPs and other CPs. Finally, the EEs with idle mode are
higher. This shows the necessity of TT optimization. While when the transmission rate is
high, both with and without idle modes will use entail T; for transmission, and the EEs of
them are the same.

In Fig. 7, EEs with different 6 are given. From Fig. 7, firstly, it can be found that 6 does
not influence the EEs of DT and OWRT, but it influences the EE of TWRT. Secondly, it
can be found that the bigger the 8, the lower the EE of TWRT. All of these have been
proved in Proposition 5. In Fig. 7, EE of RT-NDL is also given. From it, we can know that
EE of RT-NDL is the worst in RT even it compares with EE of TWRT when 6 = 0.6,
which also shows the effectiveness of DLs in RT.

Comparing EEs in minimizing E7 with maximizing C7, two results can be found: (i)
EEs are no more a decreasing function. This is because the OTT in maximizing Cy is
always T’ = 0. While in minimizing E7, when the transmission tasks have been com-
pleted, the transmission models can change into idle state. Then the influences of CPs
become more obvious, when SE is low, the CPs are bigger than TPs and EEs are increasing
functions. While when SE is high, TPs are much bigger than CPs, the influences of CPs
can be ignored, and EEs are decreasing functions; (ii) EEs of OPA are higher than those
of equal power allocation, which shows the significance of OPA.

In Fig. 8, EEs with maximizing Cy and minimizing E7 simultaneously are also given.

From Fig. 8, it can be found that EEs of maximizing Cr and minimizing E7 simultaneously

are higher than that of only maximizing Cy or only minimizing Ey. This is because the
OTPs in it need to consider Cy and E7, simultaneously. In Fig. 8, EE of RT-NDL which is
the worst in RT can also be obtained.

From Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, it can be found that among different transmission
models, EE of TWRT is almost always the maximum and EE of DT is almost always the
minimum. The TWRT has the maximum EE both for relay node’s assistance and its time
delay advantage. Also, it can be found that EE of RT-NDL is lower than the other RT with
DLs. These two phenomenons suggest that relay technique and DLs in RT can improve

system’s EE.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, throughput, energy consumption, and EE with consideration of non-ideal
PA efficiency, non-negligible CP consumption, and DLs in RT, through joint optimization
of TPs and TT allocation, have been analyzed. The EET with three optimization cases
have been given, and several characteristics could be found: (i) with maximizing Cy to
maximize EE, EEs without idle state are higher, EE of OWRT when relay node is closer
to the middle of two source nodes is higher, and EE of TWRT when relay node is closer
to node S; and 0; = 0.5 is higher. At the same time, outage probability of TWRT is the
best; (ii) with minimizing Ey to maximize EE, EEs without idle state are lower when SE is
low and transmission tasks ratio only influences the EEs of TWRT; (iii) with Dinkelbach’s
algorithm and one-by-one optimal algorithm to maximize EE, EEs are higher than that
of only maximizing Cy or only minimizing E7; (iv) relay technique and DLs in RT can
improve systems EE. All of these have been verified by the theoretical analysis and the
simulations. For the energy harvesting property of SWIPT, the EEs of these three cases
with SWIPT can be studied in the further work.

Appendix

Proof of Proposition 4

First, optimal 0; and 02 are analyzed to maximize jy, under the constraints of 0; + 02 = 1
and {01,02} €[0,1]. With Pj = Py = Py = Py = P, = P, T’ = 0, G, fo, and channel
gains, y,, and yj, can be reformulated as

- ojd~*(1—d)~*

m= (14 Snare ay ea): me
- (1 — 0,)d~“(1 — d)~*

Yn = © (: r 0)\(1—d)-* —d") +d *+ (1 — a=) (31D)

oid~*(1—d)~* ___ oid “0-4 then
01 (1-d)~-°-d-*H2d-& 01 (1-4) —-*-d- Hd - "HH 1-4) -&”

Vr, =4+ab(01), Vr, = a+ ac(o1), and Y= + Vy + VV = a +2a+a(a+ 1)(b(01) +
c(01)) + a*b(01)c(01) can be obtained. Ignore all the parts that have no relation with 0; in

Assuming P =a, b(01) = , and c(o1) =

Yt, the problem about optimal 0; to maximize jj can be given as

max f(01) = a(a + 1)(B(01) +. c(01)) + a7 D(01) c(01) (32a)

s.t.0 <0, <1. (32b)

With f” (0) < 0 and f’(0.5) = 0, 7; is the maximum when 0] = 02 = 0.5 can be obtained
for in such case ); is the maximum.
Second, ORP is analyzed to maximize y,. With 0; = 0.5, the ORP problem in TWRT

can be given as

max g(d) = a(a + 1)(b(d) + e(d)) + a’ b(d)c(d) (33a)

s.t.0 <d <1, (33b)

d “(1—d)* ~*(1—d)~* . . .
where b(d) = eee and c(d) = oy With g’(d) < 0, y is a decreasing
function of d that can be obtained, which means when the relay node is near node Sj, 7;

is higher for in such case } is bigger.

Proof of Proposition 5

It has been shown that the optimization problem of (19) is a convex problem and it can
be solved separately; then, the optimal T; and T> in DT should satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-
Tucker (KKT) conditions. With Pg, = Pg, = Pg,, then the KKT conditions can be
expressed as

TE (: —In oer) + Pa — Pnei = - 4, (34c)
3 2

where A is the Lagrange multiplier. From (34), it can be found that the left-hand sides of

(34b) and (34c) are equal to each other, then the optimal TT satisfies cet = Caper =

Rq. Substituting it into the KKT conditions, it is easy to see that Ry is not a function of B.

Page 23 of 26
Cai et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:156 Page 24 of 26

With it, the minimum TEC in DT can further be obtained as

R R

(35)

which is not a function of f. It is easy to understand intuitively. With the optimal TT,
the transmission tasks on each direction and each bit is transmitted with identical data
rate Ry and identical time duration 1/Rg. Therefore, the energy consumed by each bit is
identical no matter in which direction it is. Then the minimum TEC only depends on the
Cr. The same conclusion can also be obtained in OWRT with the same method. All of

these show that 77 and 7, have no relation with f.
3BCr
In TWRT, (26a) that is a increasing function of 4, = 27” — 1 can be known. When

Cr and Ti; are known, if 6 is increasing, then TEC is increasing. It shows that 7; is a
decreasing function of B.
