Background: The intersection traffic signal control problem (ITSCP) has become even more important as traffic
congestion has been more intractable. The ITSCP seeks an efficient schedule for traffic signal settings at
intersections with the goal of maximizing traffic flow while considering various factors such as real-time strategies,
signal timing constraints, rapid developments in traffic systems, and practical implementation. Since the factors
constituting the ITSCP exhibit stochastically complicated interactions, it is essential to identify these factors to
propose solution methods that can address this complexity and still be practically implemented.

Objective: The objective of this review is to provide a survey of problems, methods, and practices in the evaluation
of the ITSCP. In this paper, a unified terminology for the ITSCP and a citation network of the current body of
relevant research are accordingly presented, and various assumptions, constraints, and solution approaches are
Summarized. A review across the entire body of knowledge throughout the history of the ITSCP is therefore
provided. This review also highlights open issues and challenges that remain to be addressed by future research.

 

Keywords: Traffic control signal problem, Traffic signal, Traffic flow, Signal timing, Optimization

1 Introduction

In this paper, we review research on the intersection
traffic signal control problem (ITSCP), which has been
consistently studied for over 60 years since Webster [1]
first published guidelines for traffic signal settings. A
decade later, Robertson [2] developed a software tool
named TRANSYT that determined optimal fixed-time
traffic signal settings and calculated the performance
index of the signal network. Following their research,
theoretical analyses have been conducted to derive equa-
tions for the traffic capacity and average delay per
vehicle at a signalized intersection [3, 4], and various
microscopic traffic simulators have been developed to
optimize traffic signal settings (e.g, VISSIM) [5]. Based
on these theoretical foundations, various algorithms have
since been proposed considering the rapid development
of traffic infrastructure such as vehicular actuated

systems and induction loop detectors [6]; this review
focuses on these algorithms.

Research on the ITSCP has grown much more import-
ant with increasing traffic congestion. Traffic congestion
has always been a crucial aspect of urban planning but
has become a serious issue that must be addressed due
to the rapid increase in the number of vehicles and
transportation demand [7]. Traffic signal control is an
important tool in traffic flow management as it is
considered as one of the most effective ways to reduce
traffic congestion at intersections [8]. As automated and
connected vehicle technologies have recently become
more popular, further research on the ITSCP continues
to be necessary.

As McKenney and White [9] stated, there is no single
dominant approach for the study of the ITSCP. Because
of vehicle flow interactions within the network, human
behavioral considerations, stochastic traffic demand, and
traffic accidents, the ITSCP is a complex problem [10].
The ITSCP is further complicated by not only the
randomness of vehicular arrivals at an intersection, but

also by the various configurations and numbers of
intersections, types of vehicles in the network, and the
different priorities of real-time traffic management
strategies. A review of the problem characteristics and
relevant solution approaches can therefore provide
researchers a guideline for understanding the ITSCP to
help them gain the intuition required to solve it.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the ITSCP background and defines
the terms to be used throughout the paper. Section 3
describes the details and issues of the ITSCP. The next
two sections classify the ITSCP according to several
perspectives: Section 4 describes the classification
schemes and Section 5 classifies the traffic flow models
and methods used to solve the ITSCP. Finally, Section 6
summarizes the current state of research and suggests
directions for future research.

2 Background and terminology

Because the terminology used in ITSCP research papers
has been constantly changing for decades, it is essential
to first clearly and consistently define traffic signal
terminology. In this review, the definitions of terms are
taken from the traffic signal timing manual of the
Federal Highway Administration of the United States
Department of Transportation [11].

At an intersection, the movements of various users
such as vehicles and pedestrians follow the rules
indicated by traffic signals. In traditional traffic signal
settings, there exists a sequence of indications that
periodically repeats. There are three main concepts
describing traffic signal sequence settings: cycle, phase,
and duration. The cycle is the total time required to
complete one signalization sequence for all movements
at an intersection, the phase is the controller timing unit
associated with one or more movements, and the
duration is the amount of time the signal spends in each
phase, during which the signal indications do not change
[11]. Furthermore, a traffic flow group is defined as one
or more compatible movements of road users, and each
phase has a set of timings for each traffic flow group.
Figure 1 illustrates eight phases of typical vehicular and
pedestrian movements at a four-legged intersection, in
which the solid and dashed lines represent vehicle and
pedestrian movements, respectively. Each number in
Fig. 1 corresponds to a phase; for example, the straight
westbound and right-turning vehicles, and westbound
and eastbound pedestrians crossing the northern leg of
the intersection are assigned to Phase 4.

By combining the concepts of cycle, phase, and
duration, a signal phase sequence can be defined that
represents a sequence of vehicle movements regulated
by the signal controller. Figure 2 illustrates a typical
example of a signal phase sequence at a four-legged

intersection in the United States, called a National
Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard
ring-and-barrier diagram. In this diagram, a ring is a
sequence of phases that are incompatible and thus must
be served in a particular order, and a barrier is a refer-
ence point in the cycle at which a phase in each ring has
reached its point of termination. In Fig. 2, the phases in
both rings must be simultaneously turned to red at the
barrier. Various phase combinations and orders can be
used to define a signal phase sequence as long as any
conflicting movements are avoided.

As shown in Fig. 3, ITSCP network types can be classi-
fied as isolated intersections, arterial networks, and
general networks. An isolated intersection is a single
intersection and an arterial network is a sequence of
consecutive intersections in one direction. If the network
is not an isolated intersection or an arterial network, it is
considered to be a general network. Thus, a general
network consists of multiple intersections that are not
all sequentially connected and includes grid intersec-
tions, which are also called A x B intersections.

It is important to state the general assumptions when
discussing any ITSCP. In this review, unless otherwise
specified, drivers are on the right-hand side of the road
and right-turn movements are not explicitly controlled
by traffic signals. All intersections are four-legged inter-
sections unless otherwise noted. Road users in the net-
work are passenger cars, pedestrians, transit vehicles,
passengers of transit vehicles, emergency vehicles,
motorcycles, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), large goods
vehicles (LGVs), and bicycles. Passenger cars are
considered normal vehicles that are not given any
priority. Transit vehicles (e.g., buses), and emergency
vehicles may be given priority. Motorcycles, HGVs, and
LGVs do not have priority, but are specially considered

3 Problem description

The challenge of the ITSCP is to find an optimal traffic
signal configuration schedule that maximizes the traffic
flow in a network. In other words, the goal of solving
the signal timing control problem is to determine opti-
mal phase sequences and durations for each phase. To
solve this problem, the geometric information describing
the intersections in the target network, the traffic infor-
mation including traffic demand and turning movements
of vehicles, and the limits regarding traffic signal compo-
nents are considered. This information is processed in

(b)

accordance with the model formulation. For example,
Lin and Wang [13] expressed traffic demand as the
number of variables in each cell using a cell transmission
model. The ITSCP can be solved by optimizing various
performance criteria, such as minimizing the average ve-
hicle delay or maximizing the throughput of the
network. More details of such objective criteria are
described in Section 4.4. In most studies, the
constraints considered in the ITSCP are related rules
regarding traffic flow and traffic signal laws such as
total cycle length, green signal length, and phase
sequence. The details of signal timing constraints will
be explained in Section 4.5.

Node size is proportional to the number of citations
from the other reviewed papers, and the node position
along the y-axis indicates the publication year of that
paper. Note that the number of arrows pointing into a
node may not match the number of cited papers because
references that were not cited by other reviewed papers
were omitted from the figure. Using Table 1 and Fig. 4,
the most important papers in the ITSCP field can readily
be identified, and node information such as author(s)
and publication year can be extracted. For example,
nodes 2 and 23 are larger than the other nodes shown in

Fig. 4. Then, using Table 1, it can be determined that
the paper written by Gazis in 1964 (Node 2) and the
paper written by Mirchandani and Head in 2001 (Node
23) are the most important among those evaluated in
this review.

4 ITSCP classification based on problem
characteristics

In this section, we classify the ITSCP according to its
various characteristics. Due to the highly stochastic
nature of the ITSCP, problem complexity is a crucial
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

consideration. The complexity of the ITSCP depends on
various factors such as the number and shapes of the in-
tersections and the types of vehicles in the network, as
well as the real-time strategies used (if any). Analyzing
the sources of computational complexities in the ITSCP
is relevant to the practical application of optimized traf-
fic signals at intersections. Accordingly, to provide re-
searchers with the insight required to solve the ITSCP
and address open problems, we have chosen to mainly
focus on the factors affecting problem complexity. The
optimization objectives of the ITSCP are also discussed
from a practical perspective. Table 2 shows our pro-
posed classification criteria based on the ITSCP charac-
teristics, and the details of each criterion are described
in the following subsections. Table 3 summarizes the
ITSCP literature with respect to these classification

criteria, in which the ‘Network type’ column defines the
network structure, where ‘I’ indicates a single intersec-
tion, ‘A’ indicates an arterial, and ‘G’ indicates a general
network, while ‘(A x B)’ indicates that the target network
has a grid structure with A rows and B columns, ‘(C
TL)’ indicates that the target network contains C inter-
sections, and ‘(N-leg)’ indicates that the intersection has
N legs. The ‘Lane’ column defines the maximum num-
ber of lanes in a single direction of each road in the
studied network. Finally, ‘-" means that no information
for the given column is provided in the subject paper.

intersections, arterial networks, and general networks.
Computational complexity increases dramatically as the
number of lanes and intersections increase, or as the in-
tersections are connected in more complex structures.
Earlier research therefore covered only ITSCPs at an iso-
lated intersection. For example, Dunne and Potts [14]
solved the ITSCP for an isolated intersection with a
maximum of two lanes on each leg. Afterwards, the net-
work scope expanded to include isolated intersections
with multiple lanes in each direction and various shapes
such as T-junctions [7, 26, 39]. Similarly, arterial net-
works with multiple lanes were studied in detail after

 

Gazis [16] first discussed a 1 x 2 arterial network consist-
ing of two sequential intersections. Finally, Wong [35]
explored a general network containing 15 intersections
with one or two lanes on each leg.

As computer hardware and software simulation tools
have developed, the computationally affordable network
size has increased. Recently, some papers have suc-
ceeded in applying algorithms to real-world networks
such as a 9x7 grid of intersections in Ottawa, Canada
and a general network containing 50 intersections in
Tehran city [9, 75]. Nonetheless, the ITSCP is still being
actively researched for isolated intersections or small

arterial networks. Jin and Ma [73] and Li et al. [77]
solved the ITSCP for an isolated intersection and 1 x3
arterial network model, respectively. The networks eval-
uated in both papers considered contained intersections
with only one or two lanes on each leg. Such small net-
works are still being actively researched because of the
development of connected vehicles and new solution
methods. For example, Christofa et al. [65] proposed a
person-based optimization approach on arterial network
by considering passenger occupancy of vehicles explicitly
in a connected vehicle environment. When the passen-
ger occupancies of vehicles are considered as decision
variables, the number of constraints and_ variables
increases with the number of vehicles in the system,
necessitating a small network. Additionally, as new
solution methods are developed, they are typically first
validated using a small network.

4.2 Type of road users and priority consideration

In this review, we assumed that the traffic on the roads
consists of passenger cars, pedestrians, transit vehicles
and their passengers, emergency vehicles, motorcycles,
HGVs, LGVs, and bicycles for the ITSCP. Because it is
difficult to take all traffic types into consideration, most
researchers have limited the type of traffic modes to spe-
cific categories. A large number of papers have consid-
ered only one type of passenger car without pedestrians.
Improta and Cantarella [28] first expanded the type of
road users considered to include pedestrians in addition
to a single type of passenger car. Pedestrians are
accounted for in the ITSCP in terms of the minimum
green light time required for them to cross the road.
Some papers dealing with physical queue lengths or the
occupancy of the network have accounted for various
types of passenger cars [39], and Chandan et al. [71]
considered various types of passenger cars as well as
HGVs to more precisely estimate emissions. Recently,
studies considering bicycles have been conducted as the
number of intersections with dedicated bicycle lanes in-
creases to accommodate the growing number of cyclists
[69, 79]. Portilla et al. [69] proposed separate vehicle and
bicycle models for the ITSCP to reflect the ability of
bicycles to be accommodated in smaller spaces as well
as the simpler description of the dynamic behavior of
bicycles.

Transit vehicle have been considered important road
users in the ITSCP since Salter and Shahi [80] demon-
strated that giving priority to buses reduced bus delay at
the cost of increasing passenger car delay. Subsequent
research efforts have been dedicated to finding more
advanced transit signal priority logic considering the
performance indices of the vehicles in the network.
Ekeila et al. [29] proposed an algorithm to minimize the
delay of transit vehicles while preventing negative

Page 9 of 20

impacts on street traffic. Christofa et al. [46] approached
the problem from the perspective of the individual,
especially the drivers of passenger cars and passengers of
transit vehicles. He et al. [41] gave priority not only to
transit vehicles, but also to emergency vehicles. With the
advent of connected vehicles, it is now possible to obtain
additional information about the network state and ve-
hicle operations [54]. Using vehicle-to-infrastructure
communication systems, the traffic signal control system
can receive requests from appropriately equipped
vehicles and pedestrians to generate an optimized signal
timing plan that accommodates all of the active requests.
As communication technology continues to rapidly
develop, more research into solving the ITSCP with
priority consideration is expected.

4.3 Real-time strategies: fixed-time, actuated, or adaptive
Three major traffic control strategies can be used when
solving an ITSCP: fixed-time, actuated, and adaptive
[57]. The fixed-time strategy establishes optimal signal
plans for fixed signal phase sequences with a fixed time
duration for each phase. Adopting the fixed-timed strat-
egy assumes that traffic demand remains similar at all
times to calculate the optimal signal plans based on
historical traffic information. Gazis [16] and Smith [26]
used the fixed-time strategy for a 1 x 2 arterial network
and an isolated intersection, respectively.

The actuated strategy collects real-time data from
infrastructure-based sensors and applies a simple logic
criterion such as green light extension, gap out, or max
out. Green light extension prolongs the green phase
based on traffic flow rate. Gap out terminates a phase
when the time interval between consecutive activations
of a vehicle detector exceeds an established threshold.
Max out terminates the green phase when it exceeds the
established maximum green phase duration. Since
Dunne and Potts [14] first adopted the actuated strategy
of green light extension assuming a constant arrival rate
per experiment, actuated strategies have been consist-
ently applied in research [40, 54, 60, 75].

The adaptive strategy is similar to the actuated strat-
egy, but utilizes predicted traffic conditions in the near
future. Dell’Olmo and Mirchandani [33] identified
vehicle platoons and predicted their movements in the
network using the Approximate Prediction in Response
to a Signal Network (APRES-NET) model. The adaptive
strategy has been implemented using various other
prediction algorithms, and several adaptive signal control
systems have been developed accordingly. These systems
include ACS-Lite [81], SCATS [82], SCOOT [83], OPAC
[84], MOTION [85], UTOPIA [86], and RHODES [6].
Recently, Lee et al. [8] predicted information including
lane-to-lane turning proportions, adjustment factors,
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

queue lengths, and arrival and discharge rates using a
rolling-horizon process and then calculated an optimized
signal plan using a proactive global optimization
method. Because adaptive strategies require highly
accurate prediction algorithms as well as good signal
plan optimization, developing algorithms based on an
adaptive strategy could be more difficult than when
doing so based on an actuated strategy.

4.4 Objectives

Lee and Park [87] discussed two measures for evaluating
the performance of traffic signal control algorithms: mo-
bility and sustainability. Mobility measures consist of the
average total delay, average total throughput, average
total travel time, average total number of vehicle stops,
and average queue length. Sustainability measures con-
sist of emissions and fuel consumption. Most research
into the ITSCP has primarily used mobility measures.

4.4.1 Mobility measures

A fundamental performance measure when solving an
ITSCP is the delay per vehicle, the minimization of
which serves to minimize the average waiting time of
vehicles at an intersection due to a red signal. This
performance measure is the most commonly used in
ITSCP design as indicated by the fact that 61 of the 72
papers in this review treated delay as the fundamental
performance index. Some papers considered a weighted
delay as a performance measure. Prashanth and Bhatna-
gar [36] gave a higher weight to main road traffic delay,
and Murat and Gedizlioglu [76] proposed a weighted
average delay considering traffic volumes in each direc-
tion as an objective value. For situations considering
different traffic mode priorities, some researchers mini-
mized the delay of transit vehicles [29, 41], and some
considered weighted personal delays for both passenger
cars and transit vehicles according to their respective
passenger occupancies [46, 65].

Another important concept when evaluating traffic
signal systems is the throughput of the network. In the
ITSCP, throughput is the capacity of the network,
defined as the number of vehicles passing through the
network. Smith [26] attempted to maximize the
throughput. Later, some researchers combined capacity
maximization in terms of throughput with other mea-
sures [34, 36, 39, 52, 67, 70, 73].

The total travel time of a vehicle is the duration of
time it moves in the network. Wong and Yang [45] con-
sidered the total travel time of vehicles as a performance
index when solving both a signal setting optimization
problem and _ traffic assignment problem. They
attempted to take into account the fact that the equilib-
rium pattern flow of a network is strongly related to sig-
nal settings. Some studies conducted within an assumed

Page 10 of 20

connected vehicle environment have also used the total
travel time of vehicles as a performance index [67].

Minimizing the total number of vehicle stops in a net-
work has also been used as a mobility measure. Vehicle
stops, which occur due to a red light or accumulated
queue, are directly related to driver satisfaction. Some
studies developed flexible models that minimize either
the average delay or total number of stops [13, 37, 49,
51], and some studies combined the two performance
measures using weighted combinations [35, 60, 64, 72].

To balance each traffic signal phase and each direction
in an intersection, the concept of queue length, defined
as the total number of vehicles waiting on the roads at
each intersection, has been used. Queue length is
correlated to the delay or number of stops and as such is
typically applied together with these performance
measures. Spall and Chin [10], De Schutter and De
Moor [42], and Feng et al. [57] proposed the
minimization of the average queue length as an
additional objective of an ITSCP. Specifically, Feng et al.
[57] verified that the minimization of queue length can
lower the variance of vehicle delay in each phase. To
balance queue length for all roads in the subject
network, Sen and Head [37] and De Schutter [62] mini-
mized the maximum queue length.

4.4.2 Sustainability measures

As awareness of the importance of environmental pro-
tection has grown, researchers have begun to investigate
the environmental impacts of traffic signalization. Aslani
et al. [75] employed a microscopic emissions/fuel con-
sumption model to minimize both exhaust products
such as carbon dioxide and fuel consumption to improve
sustainability. Models evaluating emissions/fuel con-
sumption require the assumption of some constraints on
vehicular speed, deceleration, and acceleration. As stated
by Han et al. [63], emissions-related objectives make
traffic signal optimization problems more difficult due to
their nonlinearity and non-convexity.

4.4.3 Other measures

Additionally, various performance indices have been
used in accordance with different assumptions and
problem-solving methods. For arterial networks, the
bandwidth, or portion of a signal cycle during which a
vehicle can progress through the signals without stops,
has been maximized [31, 33]. Improta and Cantarella
[28] and Wong and Wong [70] considered cycle-time
minimization as a secondary objective, claiming that if
two signal time plans output similar levels of delay and
capacity, the plan with the shorter cycle time is better.
Arel et al. [30] minimized the likelihood of intersection
cross-blocking. Some authors compared the aggregated
average speed of vehicles [9] and the number of vehicles
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

in bottleneck links [59]. When accounting for cyclists in
the ITSCP, Wang et al. [79] attempted to maximize
safety by proposing a traffic conflict index estimated
based on the probability of vehicle crossing and the po-
tential traffic conflict severity.

4.5 Signal timing constraints

In this sub-section, we summarize ITSCP constraints
regarding cycle length, green phase duration, and phase
sequence signal timing constraints.

4.5.1 Cycle length

Constraints on cycle length can be classified into four
types: fixed, limited minimum length, limited maximum
length, and unrestricted. Dell’Olmo and Mirchandani
[33] optimized traffic signals while maintaining the total
time of one complete phase sequence; in other words,
they assumed a fixed cycle length. Some papers limited
the minimum and maximum cycle length [31], whereas
others limited only the maximum cycle length, such as
Gallivan and Heydecker [7], who limited it to 120s. Spall
and Chin [10], however, calculated the total cycle length,
red-green splits, and offset times without any
restrictions.

4.5.2 Green phase duration

In a similar fashion, the green phase duration can either
be constrained by a minimum/maximum limit or
allowed to be any value. The selection of the minimum
and maximum green phase durations is dependent on
the traffic characteristics of the study area and the space
available for vehicles to queue [76].

A minimum limit on the green phase duration is nor-
mally required for safety and to guarantee that no phase
is skipped [65], and is also relevant to pedestrians.
Because signals from different road directions are
entangled in a single traffic signal system at an intersec-
tion, a minimum limit on the green phase duration in
one direction can accordingly be interpreted as a mini-
mum limit on the red phase duration in the perpendicu-
lar direction. To ensure that pedestrians can cross the
road comfortably, this red phase should not be too short
[39]. When setting the minimum green time to accom-
modate a pedestrian crossing, the minimum duration
depends on the width of the crossing and the assumed
walking speed of the pedestrians [35].

A maximum limit on the green phase duration is usu-
ally defined to limit the green extension for signal
groups [73]. Most papers started from a minimum green
time value and extended the green phase duration until
reaching the maximum limit. Though some papers de-
fined only a minimum limit on the green phase duration
and allowed a long green phase [35], it is normal

Page 11 of 20

practice to constrain the maximum green phase or the
total cycle length.

4.5.3 Phase sequence

The signal phase sequence represents a kind of rule
between vehicle drivers and traffic signals. Some
researchers have claimed that the control system should
use a fixed signal phase sequence so as not to confuse
drivers, while others have argued against a fixed phase
sequence for the sake of performance improvement.

In the early years of ITSCP study, most researchers
treated the phase sequence as a given parameter and for-
mulated the problem using fixed phases [14, 16, 18, 20,
22, 24, 26, 28]. Ross et al. [18] addressed the problem
using only two phases whereas Wong [35] generalized it
to multiple phases. The assumption that the sequence of
phases is fixed enforces safety and fairness constraints
[6, 88].

Some studies predefined signal phase groups in which
compatibility was assured and selected a proper signal
phase sequence from among these groups at each rolling
horizon. For example, Lee et al. [8] proposed a multi-
resolution strategy for updating the elements of the
signal plans that included a cycle-by-cycle signal phase
sequence and adjusted the current second-by-second
green signal timing. Some studies formulated the exist-
ing group-based signal as an agent and applied a multi-
agent system strategy [55, 73]. The advantages of using
predefined signal groups include a high degree of flexi-
bility when specifying signal plans and the ability to deal
with a wide range of traffic patterns in a systematic way
[8]. Dynamic programming has been widely used to
choose phase sequences because the ITSCP can be
solved recursively without fixed phase constraints within
affordable limits of computational complexity [6, 27, 37].

When not using fixed phase sequences, Dell’Olmo and
Mirchandani [33] claimed that any sequence of phases
and their associated phase durations could be considered
for signal plans. In this case, the ITSCP involves a choice
of phase sequences and timings to optimize a specified
performance index. For example, Haddad et al. [32] sim-
plified traffic flow as a set of vehicle movements at an
isolated intersection and determined when to switch the
green-red signal for each vehicle movement. By using
flexible phase sequences, phase pictures were generated
considering real-time traffic patterns so the travel delay
caused by inefficient phase formulations could be
reduced [55].

5 ITSCP classification based on solution methods

methods applied in the literature, as summarized in

ematical models based on a framework reflecting traffic

dynamics and solved using analytic methods. The Light-
hill-Whitam—Richards model [89, 90], cell transmission
model (CTM) [91], and other various models have been
used to account for macroscopic traffic dynamics [32].
Analytic methods such as the branch and bound (B&B)

algorithms have been used to solve iteratively small and
simple ITSCPs. There are, however, various solution ap-
proaches that have been applied to ITSCPs regardless of
problem size or conditions, including those employing a
rule-based method, genetic algorithm (GA), simulation-
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

based approach, dynamic programming (DP), multi-
agent system (MAS), game theory approach, neural net-
work (NN), or reinforcement learning (RL), which are
reviewed in this section.

Most early researchers employed a rule-based method
to solve the ITSCP [14, 18, 22, 24, 33]. The rule-based
method defines key states and proper actions corre-
sponding to each state to optimize the performance cri-
teria. In a signal timing control problem, key states are
usually represented in terms of whether or not the
current queue length or the duration of the current
green phase is within the specified range. Actions can
then be taken to switch the phase sequence or extend
the green phase duration. Recently, some researchers
have also combined rule-based methods with other
methods or assumed various problem scenarios for
evaluation. For example, Murat and Gedizlioglu [76]
combined fuzzy logic and a rule-based method by defin-
ing key states with approximated input. Considering an
adaptive strategy, Ekeila et al. [29] used a dynamic rule-
based system that changes rules depending on traffic
conditions to handle real-time problems.

The GA is a remarkable heuristic method that has
been widely used in signal timing design for decades
since Foy et al. [92] first used a GA to optimize the
phase sequence and green phase duration in a traffic
network of four intersections, showing a significant im-
provement in system performance [21]. Lo et al. [58]
formulated a mathematical model based on the CTM
and developed a heuristic approach based on a GA to re-
duce the extensive computation time required to solve
the mathematical model for large networks. Liu and
Chang [38] explicitly modeled physical queue evolution
according to lane group to account for shared-lane traf-
fic intersections and used a GA to solve the model. Once
it had been verified that GAs are adept at obtaining
high-quality optimization solutions using microscopic
simulation tools [93], many studies developed GA-based
simulation programs [21, 48]. In particular, Stevanovic
et al. [21] extended the capability of a GA formulation
by optimizing transit-prioritized traffic settings on roads
with both private and transit traffic.

In addition to GA-based simulation programs, general
simulation-based approaches have been proposed by
many researchers to account for traffic flow interactions
[38]. In a simulation-based approach, decision variables
are optimized based on performance indices generated
from the underlying traffic flow model that are devel-
oped using mathematical models in the simulation tool.
The TRANSYT [2] and TRANSYT-7F [94] programs are
the most widely used off-line signal timing optimization
simulators. For adaptive traffic control systems, the
SCOOT [95], SCATS [96], OPAC [83], PRODYN [97],
CRONOS [17], and RHODES [6] programs have been

Page 13 of 20

developed. Many researchers have solved optimization
problems and evaluated their models using these simula-
tion tools. Examples of simulation-based optimization
include McKenney and White [9], who attempted to find
the optimal traffic signal settings using a simulation
within the SUMO traffic simulation environment, and
Dell’Olmo and Mirchandani [33], who used APRES-NET
to estimate the traffic flows in a network. A number of
studies have evaluated models using simulations because
such evaluations can reflect the stochastic inter-arrival
times of vehicles as well as vehicle interactions. For ex-
ample, VISSIM [8, 29, 41, 57, 71], NETSIM [31, 60, 70],
AIMSUN [46, 65, 75], and several other traffic simula-
tion tools have been used to evaluate the performance of
traffic models.

Motivated by its generality, some researchers have
used DP to develop a flexible control algorithm applic-
able to a variety of performance measures and traffic
conditions [6, 27, 37, 44]. Sen and Head [37] first applied
DP to the controlled optimization of phases, using
phases as stages and green phase durations as control
variables in the DP formulation. In a follow-up study,
Mirchandani and Head [6] developed an algorithm in-
corporating DP to control a 1 x 9 arterial network. Since
the computational demand of the recursive calculations
in DP dramatically increases as the network size in-
creases, Cai et al. [27] proposed a modified DP algorithm
to approximate the state space using RL. Zheng and
Recker [44] developed a recursive optimization proced-
ure consisting of data processing, flow prediction,
parameter optimization, and signal control.

With increasing attempts to control traffic networks in
a distributed way, the MAS has been investigated as an
important solution approach [78]. Multi-agent learning,
the game theory approach, and RL are typical solution
approaches related to MAS. Roozemond [56] proposed a
system that can autonomously adapt to changing envi-
ronments by defining each component of the traffic sys-
tem as an agent, then applied artificial intelligence to the
defined agents—intelligent traffic signals—to provide
prediction and control strategies. The need to define the
agents of a traffic system is associated with the challenge
of having a large number of agents that act in a highly
coupled environment, but McKenney and White [9]
succeeded in developing an MAS for a 9x7 grid of
intersections. As an example of a game theory-based ap-
proach, Villalobos et al. [23] represented an intersection
as a non-cooperative game in which each player (signal)
tries to minimize its queue and then found the Nash
equilibrium as the solution of the ITSCP.

Reinforcement learning has been widely used as a
practical computational tool to obtain an optimal con-
trol policy [30]. Choy et al. [68], Bazzan [78], and Balaji
et al. [34] used RL to implement cooperative hierarchical
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

MASs for real-time signal timing control of complex
traffic networks. The largest traffic network evaluated
with RL was a general network containing 29 traffic
lights studied by Balaji et al. [34]. Some studies have
combined RL with fuzzy relations or neural networks
(NN). Choy et al. [68] simultaneously applied a fuzzy
NN and RL to optimize traffic signal timings for a large
complex traffic network by dividing the main ITSCP into
sub-problems, adjusting the learning rate and weights
related to the fuzzy relations using RL, further adjusting
the fuzzy relations using an evolutionary algorithm, and
then calculating the optimal signal timing parameters.
Among the various RL algorithms, Q-learning, which is
a popular model-free RL algorithm, has been applied to
ITSCP in many studies. Abdulhai et al. [66] employed
Q-learning for an isolated intersection under various
traffic conditions. Because constructing a Q-learning
model in ITSCP requires a considerable number of
states and actions, Prashanth and Bhatnagar [36] modi-
fied the model to include function approximation and
solved the problem for multiple networks including a
3x3 grid of intersections and a 1 x 8 arterial network.
Advanced RL algorithms such as the actor-—critic algo-
rithm have also been applied to the ITSCP [75].

In addition to the approaches discussed above, the
Petri net has also been used to model ITSCP states. List
and Cetin [98] and Dotoli and Fanti [99] modeled the
dynamics of traffic network systems using Petri nets
while adopting signal timing control algorithms from
other researchers. Di Febbraro et al. [74] used a hybrid
Petri net (HPN) model to express the problem of coord-
inating traffic lights with the goal of improving the per-
formance of transit and emergency vehicles, and then
developed control algorithms based on the HPN model.
In a traffic network modeled by HPN, traffic flows are
modeled as fluids, and the event-driven dynamics of the
traffic lights and their influence on the flow dynamics
can be considered explicitly. In another approach to
modeling the dynamics of traffic network systems, Por-
tilla et al. [69] used a model-based predictive control
method to represent the flows of vehicles and bicycles as
well as their interactions.

6 Discussion and future research directions

6.1 Trends

In this paper, we reviewed the available literature to
provide a comprehensive overview of the various
methods that have been applied to solve the problem of
traffic signal control at intersections. We described the
ITSCP and classified the related literature in terms of
the various aspects of the problem. As shown in Table
1, the signal timing control problem has been widely
studied. In this section, we present the trends of several
aspects of ITSCP research including problem features,

Page 14 of 20

solution approach, and infrastructure development. In
the first two subsections, changes in the problem
definitions and methodologies over time are discussed.
The last three subsections describe how the develop-
ment of infrastructure technology such as vehicle
connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and vehicle detec-
tion has affected the ITSCP.

6.1.1 Problem features

With the expansion of the ITSCP research field, various
performance measures including vehicle emissions, ve-
hicle fuel consumption, and transit passenger delay have
been considered in addition to vehicle delay. Critically,
the size and shapes of networks as well as the categories
of road users have diversified over time, and as commu-
nications technology and computational methods have
been developed, strategies dealing with real-time traffic
data have become popular in the ITSCP field.

There are several trends among the problem features
reviewed in Section 4. Studies considering transit vehi-
cles as road users are typically related to priority consid-
eration, and studies accounting for pedestrians typically
limit the minimum value of the green phase durations to
ensure adequate crossing time. The signal timing
constraints used (phase sequence and cycle length) are
typically related to the type of intersection network con-
sidered as summarized in Table 5, in which the columns
indicate the type of intersection network, and the rows
represent the phase sequence and cycle length
constraints applied. The numbers in each cell in Table 5
indicate the papers corresponding to the problem fea-
tures defined by that cell. Note that these reference
numbers are different from the node IDs presented in
Table 1. According to Table 5, most studies constrained
the phase sequence of the traffic signal to a fixed se-
quence or a set of predefined sequences. As the phase
sequences become more flexible, the time complexity of
the ITSCP increases considerably. Additionally, research
using isolated intersections tends to rely upon flexible
cycle length constraints whereas more than half of the
research conducted using arterial networks relied upon
fixed or limited cycle length constraints.

6.1.2 Solution approach

The approach used to solve an ITSCP depends on the
size of the target network and the assumptions in the
problem. Mathematical programming models have been
widely used to analyze small-size intersections. In almost
all cases except for several early papers, the proposed so-
lutions were evaluated using simulations of various traf-
fic scenarios. The recent application of RL and MAS to
large intersections and complex traffic situations has en-
hanced the ability of researchers to study the ITSCP at
larger scales. Focusing on these recent applications of

RL and MAS, Bazzan [100] presented problems and
methods related to MAS in traffic engineering and em-
phasized remaining challenges that should be addressed
in future MAS research.

Table 6 summarizes the ITSCP literature based on the
solution methods reviewed in Section 5 and the problem
features, in which the columns indicate the major
methods used to solve the ITSCP and the rows represent
the target intersection network type and real-time strat-
egy employed. The numbers in each cell indicate the pa-
pers corresponding to the solution method and problem
feature indicated for the cell. As can be seen from Table
6, analytic methods have been predominantly applied to
isolated intersections, whereas RL and MAS have been
predominantly used to control signal timings in general
networks. Most of the papers in Table 6 used actuated
strategies for real-time control, and adaptive strategies
that require prediction logic for traffic flows have rarely
been developed.

6.1.3 Vehicle connectivity

Advanced cars with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity have also
recently been developed. Vehicle connectivity can
now be classified into these two different types ac-
cording to the communications target: V2I gathers

the data generated by vehicles at infrastructure points
to share traffic information from infrastructure to ve-
hicles; V2V involves communications among vehicles
regarding their speed, position, and traffic situation.
In a connected vehicle environment with both V2I
and V2V connectivity, a great deal more data describ-
ing the traffic states near an intersection can be col-
lected and utilized for signal control. As algorithms
based on connected cars are expected to potentially
improve the performance of urban signalized intersec-
tions, Guo et al. [101] reviewed methods to estimate
traffic flow and optimize traffic signal timing in con-
nected and automated vehicle environments.

6.1.4 Autonomous vehicles

The technological advancement of autonomous vehicles
is a valuable tool for the investigation of ITSCP solu-
tions. McKinsey & Company predicted that up to 15% of
new cars sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous [102].
If all cars could be controlled autonomously, there
would be no need to consider driver reaction times,
allowing for improved switching priority between several
roads and the setting of very short green phase
durations. Additionally, a reservation-based system for
isolated intersections that do not specifically act as
conventional traffic signals can be provided to ensure

orderly movements of autonomous vehicles [78]. In
other words, intersections without traffic signals can be
developed as long as all vehicles in the network are
autonomous.

6.1.5 Vehicle detection

Finally, the development of vehicle detection technolo-
gies enables the practical implementation of traffic signal
control algorithms that have been researched in the
ITSCP field for decades. Even though various real-
time algorithms have been proposed, only a few algo-
rithms have been used in practice due to the cost
and time issues arising from the need to install detec-
tion sensors. In order to gather traffic information to
serve as the input of an algorithm, detection sensors
would previously have needed to be installed under
roads at considerable cost and effort, but in recent
years, technological advances in vehicle detection have
allowed for the use of cameras or Bluetooth sensors
as detectors instead, which is likely to solve such
practical issues. Current camera-based vehicle detec-
tion technology can clearly distinguish the license
plate number and type of each vehicle by analyzing
pictures or videos [103, 104]. The use of cameras to
detect vehicles therefore offers a much more econom-
ical and simpler approach as they can be mounted on
extant traffic signal poles. Another new type of ve-
hicle detector, the Bluetooth sensor, can estimate the
travel times and velocities of vehicles and detect the
turning movement of each vehicle at low installation
and maintenance costs [105]. Furthermore, new ve-
hicle detection technologies can provide various data
that were unattainable in the past to serve as input
data for traffic signal control algorithms.

6.2 Future directions

Although various formulations and solution approaches
have been applied to solve ITSCPs over the decades,
there are still many opportunities for future work. The
following subsections describe problems that require
further study.

6.2.1 Generalization of intersection networks

The most important direction for future research in the
ITSCP field is the generalization of the problem. In
other words, it remains necessary to optimize traffic sig-
nals for generalized intersections. Despite the efforts and
advances made through various ITSCP research, the net-
works that have been studied remain too simple and
small to apply the research results in practice. From the
perspective of network simplicity, most researchers as-
sumed the shape of their subject networks to consist of
four-legged or sometimes three-legged intersections.

Page 16 of 20

However, it remains necessary to develop an approach
that can handle a network consisting of variously shaped
intersections. To address issues associated with the size
of the network, larger intersection grids must be accom-
modated. Additionally, determining the appropriate size
of a network to enable practical utilization appears to be
a crucial research topic.

6.2.2 Consideration of real-world problem features

In addition to intersection network types, real-world
problem features including road user types, physical
properties of the road, and traffic flows should be con-
sidered in order to generalize solutions to the ITSCP.
Lan and Chang [106] presented results regarding the
effect of heavy mixed scooter—vehicle flows on the
propagation of intersection queues. Similarly, different
road users—including pedestrians, transit vehicles, mo-
torcycles, bicycles, light rail cars, and HGVs—have
complicated interactions with the environment due to
their unique characteristics. For example, HGVs tend
to have a lower acceleration and deceleration rate than
other vehicles. As such, optimizing traffic signals for
networks comprised of various road users is necessary
for real-world implementation. Bicycles in particular
have recently emerged as an alternative transportation
mode, and studies have accordingly been conducted to
investigate the interactions between bicycles and pas-
senger cars, minimize the delay of cyclists, or explicitly
consider two-stage bicycle left turns [69, 107]. As
studies assessing the delays of cyclists and identifying
the states of bicycles are currently underway, research
into the ITSCP considering bicycles is expected to
accelerate.

From a practical perspective, the slope and speed limit
of roads, which are related to acceleration and deceler-
ation rates, and the road capacity, which is used to cal-
culate the volume of traffic flow that an intersection
network can handle, are crucial issues. In addition, some
intersection networks contain specifically designed lanes
that allow unusual vehicle movements, such as contra-
flow bus lanes and U-turn lanes. Most traffic signal
control algorithms proposed thus far consider only sim-
plified networks without special lanes, but the existence
of those lanes could considerably influence the overall
performance of traffic signal timing control. Therefore,
it is necessary to categorize lanes or roads that are
designed for special purposes in order to assess the
efficacy of signal control algorithms in networks with
such lanes or roads.

Finally, scenarios other than unsaturated or oversatu-
rated traffic conditions, such as an accident scenario,
should also be considered to ensure robust signal timing
control. The accident scenario represents a situation in
which some portions of some lanes or of the
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

intersections in a network are disabled due to traffic ac-
cidents. Further research regarding traffic signal control
in such accident scenarios are mandatory to prepare for
the coming age of autonomous vehicles.

6.2.3 Coming age of autonomous vehicles

Indeed, the coming age of autonomous vehicles is an-
other key point that must be addressed. There exist
many differences between a case in which humans drive
cars and a case in which vehicles drive by themselves. In
the current system, it is widely accepted that signal
phase sequences should be fixed so as not to confuse
human drivers, but this is no longer necessary in the era
of self-driving vehicles. In other words, as autonomous
vehicles increasingly become a reality, the signal phase
sequence will no longer need to be fixed as machines do
not get confused. Thus, autonomous vehicle technology
relaxes a constraint regarding the phase sequence. Fur-
thermore, reaction time can be ignored when selecting
the cycle time for autonomous vehicles, though safety
will continue to be a critical performance index to pre-
vent vehicle collisions. Thus, more research considering
the characteristics of autonomous vehicles as they apply
to solutions of the ITSCP is needed.

6.2.4 Connected vehicle environment

Similarly, further study on ITSCPs in a connected ve-
hicle environment is required. Since Lee and Park [87]
solved the traffic signal timing control problem in a con-
nected vehicle environment assuming 100% penetration
rate of connected vehicles, Feng et al. [57] have pro-
posed an algorithm for solving the ITSCP according to
various connected vehicle market penetration rates, in
which they estimated the states of unconnected vehicles
based on connected vehicle data. Chandan et al. [71]
also considered the connected vehicle environment.
None of the other reviewed papers dealt with connected
vehicles. Even though the infrastructure for connected
vehicles is developing rapidly, insufficient traffic signal
control research has been conducted in this environ-
ment. In a connected vehicle environment, vehicles can
share information regarding their speed, acceleration,
position, and turning movement. Under these condi-
tions, it is possible to give priority to emergency vehicles,
control vehicle movements to prevent collisions, and
share the occurrence and location of accidents. Further-
more, the connected vehicle environment enables the
collection of information describing individual vehicles,
so that equity can also be considered to be a perform-
ance measure of the ITSCP. For example, the maximum
delay that any individual vehicle may experience can be
limited to ensure equity in a connected vehicle
environment.

6.2.5 Vehicle movement control

The ongoing development of autonomous and con-
nected vehicles influences not only the assumptions and
constraints of the traffic flow problem but also the prob-
lem definition itself. As technology for communication
between vehicles and infrastructure is developed, control
of each individual vehicle will become feasible. Informa-
tion sharing between vehicles and road infrastructure
will enable detailed tracking of each vehicle and make it
possible to prevent collisions with adjacent or crossing
vehicles. In recent years, several studies regarding the
scheduling of vehicle movements based on the arrival
and departure of each vehicle at an intersection, rather
than relying on signal timing control for traffic flow,
have appeared [87, 108-113]. This problem employs a
dynamic traffic model for vehicle movements without
considering conventional traffic signal rules. Considering
the current state of the technology and potential ad-
vances in the near future, additional research on the ve-
hicle assignment problem under the assumption of a
connected vehicle environment is necessary. With fur-
ther research, heavy traffic may be managed without
traffic signals in the future. Vehicle movement control is
also related to a path controlling scheme that considers
the dynamics between the routing decisions of autono-
mous and connected vehicles and signal timing deci-
sions. In other words, the phenomenon that vehicles
may change their routes if they experience long delays
must be considered in future work.

6.2.6 Algorithm robustness

As new connected and autonomous vehicle technologies
are still being developed, improvements in algorithm ro-
bustness with respect to system malfunctions including
noisy and delayed state measurements, communication
dropouts, or other incidents are necessary to handle the
exceptional cases and address potential safety concerns
[87]. Furthermore, traffic signal control should be inves-
tigated under a scenario in which both connected or au-
tonomous vehicles share the road network with
conventional vehicles as it will take time for all vehicles
on the road to be fully updated with such new intelligent
vehicle technologies.

6.2.7 Unified simulation framework

Finally, there is currently no standard for comparing the
performances of different traffic signal control models.
Because none of the current network designs, tested
traffic scenarios, or defined objective functions can be
discussed in a unified manner, it is difficult to quantita-
tively compare the performances of different models. For
instance, most researchers have minimized the delay per
vehicle in the timing and control of traffic signals, but
their definitions of delay may differ. “Delay” may indicate
Eom and Kim European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:50

standstill times at the intersection due to congestion, the
length of time for which the vehicle speed is less than a
threshold speed, or the time difference between arrival
and departure [48, 55, 87]. This problem could be re-
solved by proposing a set of benchmark instances. Such
standards could also contribute to the standardization of
ITSCP terminology, aiding research, communication,
and development of traffic control methods.
