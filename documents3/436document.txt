1. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the amount in the occurence of disasters has risen from 50 to 400 per year and it is
still expected to increase five times more in the next 50 years [1]. A natural disaster is a sudden event that
occurs due to natural forces of the Earth or Human faults, leading to the destruction and killing of numerous
persons [2]. Emergency can be defined as a status that requires a critical time response caused by a
catastrophic phenomenon, which could be natural (i.e. earthquake, flood and hurricane) or human-made
(i.e. Hazardous materials, fire), and that could put human lives at risk [3]. In case of disaster occurrence, it is
difficult for people at risk to be evacuated in a smooth manner. However, it is not easy to understand the
situation because people at risk often become scared in the course of a disaster. In addition, the rescuing
corridors in buildings or squares become congested with the people [4].

Depending on the disaster type, the pre-warning of sudden-onset disasters can provide enough time
for evacuations prior to the event [5]. Another influential factor in the case of natural disasters is the

probability of their occurrence and effects. Thus, to reduce the effects of the disaster, it is necessary to take
many actions before and during the disaster occurence i.e. transportation management; provide safe
emergency exits for people at risk and ensure the availability of clear optimal evacuation plans during the
disaster occurence. Furthermore, during disaster occurrence, people at risk need to know the optimal routes
that can be used for evacuation. In addition, it is essential to have knowledge on how to react to unexpected
events at the initial stage of planning [6]. Evacuation planning can be defined as a risk management strategy
that would minimize loss of life or reduce the effects of disaster before and during the occurrence of a
disaster [7]. Therefore, evacuation planning should be designed and implemented.

Several algorithms have been implemented the evacuation planning problem to finding the optimal
Emergency Routes. Such that generic algorithm [8], polynomial algorithm [9], linear programming
(LP) [10-12], cellular automata (CA) algorithm [13, 14], Immune Algorithm [3, 15] and _ neural
algorithm [16]. Where, these methods gets the optimal Emergency Routes planning by using the time-
expanded graph structure. On the other hands, one of the popular method for solving the evacuation planning
problem is the heuristic approaches method [17-20], that aims at producing a suboptimal evacuation route
planning based on the transportation network, instead of the time-expanded graph structure. In the heuristic
method, they take into consideration the route capacity constraints, and there are some constraints in this
method, such as complexity of transportation networks, as well as largness in the number of evacuees, which
leads to the production of inefficient evacuation plans. Therefore, many stuies have been done to deal with
such constraints, such that Lu et al. [18] proposed a heuristic iterative algorithm Capacity Constrained Route
Planner (CCRP) that produces a suboptimal solution for the evacuation planning problem. The static network
has been used to minimize the computational cost for the time-expanded network. CCRP ensures that all
evacuees were completely evacuated, but the main drowbaks of such algorithm is the produced evacuation
paths allow intersection nodes to hold flow for some period of time [21]. In addition, Guo et al. [17] also
proposed a heuristic approach to solve the evacuation route planning problem, taking into consideration the
capacity constrained. In his study, Max-Flow Rate Priority (MFRP) algorithm was designed to obtain
multiple candidate routes with maximum flow rate frequently. Such algorithm updates the potential available
capacity of the transportation network for the next iteration without taking into considerations the priority of
the paths during the evacuation process.

Furthermore, Lu et al. [19] proposed a classical Capacity Constrained Route Planner algorithm,
wherein two sub-algorithms were proposed; Single-Route Capacity Constrained Planner (SRCCP) and
Multiple-Route Capacity Constrained Planner (MRCCP). One of the drawbacks of such method is the small
size building networks which are used to evaluate the performance of such algorithms. Such method leads to
the increase in the total evacuation time due to increased waiting time. To improve these disadvantages,
an evacuation route algorithm has been proposed by Zeng and Wang [22], thus recommending a longer
evacuation route preferential algorithm. In fact, the proposed algorithm works well for long evacuation routes
in most cases, however, in shorter evacuation routes, this algorithm is inefficient [23].

Apparently, it is obvious that all previous work did not mention the selection of the best path for
the second iteration dynamically in real time. Mainly, when calculating the evacuation times, more than one
best path is available with a minimum wait at the same time [24, 25]. In this paper, the proposed algorithm
deals with such issue by recalculating the best path for each iteration. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm
improves the performance of previous algorithms by reducing the evacuation time as well as minimizing
the computational cost.

2. PROPOSED ALGORITHM

The main purpose of Dynamic Real-Time Capacity Constrained Routing (DRTCCR) algorithm is to
create an optimal dynamic evacuating plan to identify the Best Evacuation Path (BEP) that can evacuate
the occupancy in case of disaster occurrence.

been used as shown in Figure 2. The presented transport network model composed of 15 nodes and 17 edges
with its characteristics i.e. nodes capacity, initial occupancy for source nodes, edges capacity and the travel
time for each edge. The flow of occupancy to be evacuated should travel from the source nodes
(N1, N2 and N8) to the destination nodes (N13 and N14).

Step 6: The Best Evacuation Path (BEP) is selected based on the minimum waiting time from all paths and it

While K’’s > 0, Tp for selected path =Tp + tp = 15.

The Best Evacuation Path (BEP) is selected based on the minimum waiting time from all paths and
they are Ps (1) and Ps (3) with a waiting time of 5. To Check if all occupancies are evacuated or not,

The Best Evacuation Path (BEP) is selected based on the minimum waiting time from all paths and
they are Ps (1) and Ps (3) with a waiting time of 16. Due to the equivalence in the waiting time of Ps (1) and
Ps (3), it is optional to choose any of them. As a result of evacuating all occupancies, the algorithm process
will end. The total time needed to evacuate all occupancies in N1 is the summation of Tp for all iterations
which is equal to 45 as shown in Table 6.

The presented steps of DRTCCR algorithm are applied on the remaining source nodes, N2 and N8
in the same way in N1. The total time needed to evacuate all occupancies in N2 is the summation of Tp for
all iterations which is equal 29 as shown in Table 7. The total time needed to evacuate all occupancies in N8
is the summation of Tp for all iterations which is equal 14 as shown in Table 8.

The final evacuation plan for the selected transportation network model after applying the DRTCCR
algorithm is shown in Table 9. The total time needed to evacuate all occupancies is 88.

3. RESEARCH METHOD

The research method as well as the transportation network model with a building example are
described and illustrated in this section. The research method can be formulated as shown in Figure 3.
Transportation network defined as input, evacuation plan defined as output, as well as the objectives and
constraints are illustrated.

The transportation network model is presented as a graph (i.e. nodes and edges) with capacity
constraints, initial number of occupancy that should be evacuated, their initial locations and evacuation exits.
The capacity constrained routing technique produces a set of routes to evacuate the occupancies. Consider a
simple example as shown in Figure 4. Each node has two attributes, node capacity and initial node
occupancy. For instance, the max capacity of node N1 is fifty persons, which means N1 can hold at most fifty
persons with an initial occupancy of twenty, thus “the maximum allowed evacuees that can be moved out
from N1 is twenty’. In addition, every edge has two attributes: edge capacity and travel time. The arrows
between any two nodes i.e. the maximum edge capacity for NI—N3 edge is five and this means that
the maximum allowed evacuees number that can pass through this edge is five with a travel time equal three.

Finally, assuming that N1 has twenty evacuees and is based on a capacity constrained routing approach,
five evacuation routes can be generated as shown in Table 10. Thus, the objective of a capacity constrained
routing approach is to minimize the total time needed for evacuation, as well as to minimize
the computational cost of producing the evacuation plan.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The proposed algorithm has been analytically tested and evaluated by comparing it with other two
previous algorithms. To validate such comparison, same transportation network model was used for each
comparing operation. The first comparison was done between our proposed algorithm and the MRCCP
algorithm proposed by Lu et al. [19], where he proposed and evaluated heuristic algorithms of the capacity
constrained routing approach to find a suitable evacuation plan. The authors applied their proposed algorithm
on the transportation network model which was shown above in Figure 2. The total evacuation time of

MRCCP was equal 108. On the other hand, the total evacuation time for our proposed plan after applying it
on the same transportation network model is equal 88, which means that the DRTCCR is 20% faster than
MRCCP, and Figure 5 illustrates the comparison results between MRCCP and DRTCCR.

The second comparison was done between our proposed algorithm and the Max-Flow Rate Priority
(MFRP) algorithm, which was proposed by Guo et al. [17], where the author proposed a recent heuristic
approach to solve the evacuation route planning problem with a capacity constrained transportation network
to find a suitable evacuation plan. He applied their proposed algorithm on the transportation network model,
and the total evacuation time of the (MFRP) algorithm is equal 92, while the total evacuation time for our
proposed plan is equal 53, which infers that DRTCCR is faster than MFRP by 39%. Figure 6 illustrates
the comparison results between DRTCCR and MFRP.

5. CONCLUSION

One of the most important challenges during evacuation in case of the occurrence of a disaster is
the difficulty of finding the best and fastest paths to save the people at risk. In this paper, a dynamic real-time
capacity constrained routing (DRTCCR) algorithm is proposed, tested and evaluated. Such algorithm will be
used to improve the performance of an evacuation plan by minimizing the total evacuation time for all
evacuees. Various network models were used to simulate such problems, coupled with the application of
many evacuation planning algorithms on such models. Also, analytical and comparison studies were carried
out and the result from both studies illustrates that the DRTCCR algorithm reduces the evacuation time
compared with the MRCCP algorithm by 20%, and by 39% when compared with the MFRP algorithm.
To conclude, the proposed algorithm has proven to be efficient as compared to other related algorithms,
in dealing with evacuation problems dynamically in real time.
