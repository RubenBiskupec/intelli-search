and Control of Highly Dynamic Multilegged

Robots: A Review

Jun He and Feng Gao ©

Abstract

Multilegged robots have the potential to serve as assistants for humans, replacing them in performing dangerous,
dull, or unclean tasks. However, they are still far from being sufficiently versatile and robust for many applications. This
paper addresses key points that might yield breakthroughs for highly dynamic multilegged robots with the abilities
of running (or jumping and hopping) and self-balancing. First, 21 typical multilegged robots from the last five years
are surveyed, and the most impressive performances of these robots are presented. Second, current developments
regarding key technologies of highly dynamic multilegged robots are reviewed in detail. The latest leg mechanisms
with serial-parallel hybrid topologies and rigid-flexible coupling configurations are analyzed. Then, the development

trends of three typical actuators, namely hydraulic, quasi-direct drive, and serial elastic actuators, are discussed. After
that, the sensors and modeling methods used for perception are surveyed. Furthermore, this paper pays special
attention to the review of control approaches since control is a great challenge for highly dynamic multilegged
robots. Four dynamics-based control methods and two model-free control methods are described in detail. Third,
key open topics of future research concerning the mechanism, actuation, perception, and control of highly dynamic
multilegged robots are proposed. This paper reviews the state of the art development for multilegged robots, and

discusses the future trend of multilegged robots.

1 Introduction

Autonomous robotic systems may be classified into three
major areas: 1) less inputs—single end-effector—less out-
puts (LSL) robotic systems such as wheeled and tracked
vehicles, 2) multiple inputs—single end-effector—mul-
tiple outputs (MSM) robotic systems such as autono-
mous mobile robots (AMRs) with manipulators, and 3)
multiple inputs—multiple end-effectors—multiple out-
puts (MMM) robotic systems. Legged robots are typical
MMM robotic systems. For example, a hexapod robot
with three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) legs has 18

inputs, one body end-effector and six leg end-effectors,
and 42 outputs. More than 50% of the earth’s surface is
inaccessible to traditional vehicles with wheels or tracks.
Compared to their LSL and MSM counterparts, legged
robots possess superior mobility in natural, irregular ter-
rain. However, to further expand their capabilities, legged
robots require more complicated mechanisms and con-
trol modes.

In this paper, the term “highly dynamic multilegged
robots” refers to all quadruped and hexapod walk-
ing robots with dynamic stabilities, capable of running,
jumping, and hopping while maintaining self-balance
against sliding or external impacts. These robots have
recently shown impressive advancements in terms
of dynamic capabilities with the aid of various novel
actuation and control strategies, yielding dynamic

performance comparable to human beings or other
mammals. For instance, the MIT Cheetah 2 quadruped
robot can avoid sudden obstacles by jumping [1], and
its bounding speed reaches up to 6.4 m/s [2]. Another
impressive example is the ANYmal quadruped robot,
which exploits a sim-to-real strategy: first, reinforcement
learning is used for training neural network policies in
the simulated virtual irregular environment; next, the
obtained policies are transferred to the ANYmal quad-
ruped robot. In this way, ANYmal achieves high-level
locomotion skills, higher speeds than ever before, and
the capability of recovering rapidly from falling [3]. Com-
pared to quadruped robots, hexapod legged robots have
better stability and higher payload capacity owing to their
tripod gaits, making them suitable for disaster-rescue
tasks. For example, the Crabster hexapod robots, devel-
oped for the exploitation of ocean resources, are capable
of seabed walking and carrying out underwater tasks [4].
Shortly after the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in March
2011, some mobile robots such as iRobot and Quince
entered the nuclear power plant and carried out inspec-
tions and simple operations. However, these robots
failed quickly because of high radiation. It is now widely
acknowledged that robotic technologies at that time
were far from sufficient for carrying out complex res-
cue operations [5]. Recently, supported by the National
Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), a series
of hexapod robots with parallel legs were developed by
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) for firefighting,
transportation, and detection in disaster environments,
such as nuclear accidents [6-8]. The payloads of these
hexapod robots can reach up to 500 kg. In the DARPA
Robotics Challenge held in 2015, many humanoid robots
successfully performed various rescue operations, such
as driving a car, cutting a pipe, and opening a door in a
simulated disaster scenario of a nuclear power plant [9].
These new-generation legged robots featured high-level
force and vision perception systems, enabling force con-
trol and obstacle avoidance.

Despite the great advances made thus far, the compli-
ance, agility, and robustness of multilegged robots are
still significantly worse than their biological counter-
parts [10]. Therefore, legged robots have seldom been
used for commercial applications. In fact, robustness
and safety are the key considerations for legged robots
in outdoor environments, easily outweighing agility and
autonomy. In practice, it is very difficult for current leg-
ged robots to be used in real applications in outdoor
environments [11]; actually, only a few legged robots take
into account the requirements of a specific application,
such as nuclear disaster relief (e.g., S)TU hexapod robots
[6—8]) or inspection of gas and oil sites (e.g., ANYmal [3]
and its previous version). In addition, the performances

of legged robots are related to many factors, including
their mechanisms and actuation, perception, and control
methods. Hence, it is necessary to survey the evolution of
these technologies.

This paper reviews recent advances in highly dynamic
multilegged robots with respect to their mechanisms and
actuation, perception, and control strategies. The rest of
this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we survey
the most significant multilegged robots reported in the
last five years. A review of previous multilegged robots
can be found in Refs. [12-14]. Sections 3—6 discuss the
mechanisms and actuation, perception, and control tech-
nologies of highly dynamic multilegged robots, respec-
tively. In Section 7, based on the findings of the previous
sections, key open topics for future research are pro-
posed. Lastly, conclusions are addressed in Section 8.

2 Recent Multilegged Robots

2.1 Quadruped Robots

2.1.1 HyQ2Max and HyQreal

The first HyQ robot, developed by Istituto Italiano di Tec-
nologia (IIT) in 2011, was a fully hydraulic, torque-con-
trolled quadruped robot capable of running and jumping
[15]. HyQ2Max, pictured in Figure 1(a), is an improved

version with joint torque and range much larger than
those of the previous version. All electronic devices such
as sensors, valves, and actuators are protected inside
the mechanical structure to improve the robot’s reli-
ability and robustness against impacts and dirt. Both the
torso and leg structures are made of strong aerospace-
grade aluminum alloy. The outline dimensions of HyQ-
2Max are approximately 1.306 m x 0.544 mx0.918 m
(length x width x height), and its weight is about 80 kg
(off-board power) [16]. For each leg, there is a hip abduc-
tion/adduction (HAA) joint, a hip flexion/extension
(HFE) joint, and a knee flexion/extension (KFE) joint. The
HAA and HFE joints are rotary hydraulic actuators. The
KFE joint is actuated by a four-bar linkage mechanism
with a hydraulic cylinder. The ranges of the HAA, HFE,
and KFE joints are respectively 80°, 270°, and 165° [11].
The maximum speeds on rough terrain and flat ground
are 0.5 m/s and 1.5 m/s, respectively [17]. The step height
and depth for stair climbing are respectively 0.12 m and
0.3 m [18]. To perform a self-righting motion, the flex-
ion/extension plane of the leg is placed outward with
respect to the HAA axis, which is different from the leg
configuration of HyQ, as seen in Figure l(a). Each joint
has a high-resolution absolute encoder and torque sen-
sors. Owing to the EtherCAT real-time communication,
the position and torque control of all joints can be car-
ried out at a frequency of 1 kHz [19].

Recently, at the International Conference of Robotics
and Automation (ICRA 2019), IIT presented the latest
version of the HyQ quadruped robot, called HyQReal,
which is capable of pulling a small passenger airplane for
more than 10 m, as seen in Figure 1(b) (cited from dls.iit.
it). The robot is 1.33 m long, 0.9 m tall, and weighs 130
kg. Compared to its predecessors, HyQReal quadruped
robot is completely power-autonomous, with on-board
hydraulics, batteries, and wireless communication. In
addition, HyQReal is protected by an aluminum roll cage

and skin made of Kevlar, glass fiber, and plastic. The tech-
nical specifications of HyQ2Max and HyQReal are shown
in Table 1.

2.1.2 StarlETH and ANYmal

The ANYmal quadrupedal platform [10] was specifically
developed for autonomous operation in challenging envi-
ronments. Its predecessor StarlETH [20] was designed to
participate in the ARGOS (Autonomous Robot for Gas
and Oil Sites) Challenge for the inspection of petrochem-
ical facilities. In this challenge, each robot has to navigate
in a multilevel, outdoor facility, examine checkpoints, and
detect, identify, and report internal and external anoma-
lies. The leg links of ANYmal are installed with an offset
so that the KFE joint can rotate with a range of nearly
360°, as seen in Figure 2. Thus, the four legs of the robot
can be folded and change their configurations. The out-
line dimensions in the standing state are approximately
0.8 m x 0.6 m x 0.7 m (length x width x height), whereas
the height in the lying state is only 0.4 m. The weight of
ANYmal is only 30 kg, its payload can be up to 10 kg,
and it can reach a speed of up to 3.6 km/h. Thanks to this
high mobility, ANYmal can use its feet to open a door or
surmount obstacles. Excellent joint mobility also allows
the robot to climb stairs, get across obstacles without
touching them, and change body height and orientation
for inspection. ANYmal obtains its excellent locomotion
skills via machine learning. For example, it is capable of
learning how to run in unstructured environments, get
up after a fall, and precisely follow desired body trajec-
tories [3].

2.1.3 MIT Cheetah

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) pre-
sented a series of high-performance quadruped robots,
called Cheetah 1 through 3, which can be seen in Fig-
ure 3. Cheetah 1 has a maximum speed of 6 m/s. Its

mass is 39.406 kg, and the total cost of transport (COT
[21]) is 0.51 [22]. Cheetah 2, presented in 2015, can use
a bounding gait to obtain the maximum speed of 6.4
m/s [23]. The COT of Cheetah 2 is 0.47, smaller than
that of Cheetah 1. The leg configuration of Cheetah 2
is a planar serial mechanism. The knee joint is actuated
by a linkage mechanism, and thus its actuator can be
assembled on the hip. Each leg also has a passive flex-
ible ankle joint. Furthermore, Cheetah 1 has a flex-
ible spine, which uses a differential gear to connect to
the rear hip joints. The spine stiffness acts as a paral-
lel spring, which is able to store and release potential
energy during movement [24]. Recently, Bledt et al.
[25] presented Cheetah 3. Compared to its predeces-
sors, the abduction/adduction DOF is added to the
hip joint. The weight of Cheetah 3 is 45 kg, and its
outline dimensions are about 0.6 m x 0.256 m x 0.2 m
(length x width x height). The robot has 0.45 kWh on-
board batteries that provide approximately a two-hour

2.1.4 SCalf-Il, HIT, Baby elephant, and CNVI Robots

In 2013, supported by the National High Technology
Research and Development Program (863 Program) of
China, Shandong University (SDU), the National Univer-
sity of Defense Technology (NUST), the Harbin Institute
of Technology (HIT), the Beijing Institute of Technology
(BIT), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) devel-
oped five hydraulic highly dynamic quadruped robots, as
seen in Figure 4(a)—(c). In recent years, these robots have
continued to obtain advances in the fields of dynamic
locomotion and control.

The SCalf-II robot [26] was developed by SDU. Each
leg of this robot has three active DOFs and one passive
DOF. It can trot in unstructured terrain using compli-
ant control, and it has the capability of self-balancing
after side impact. SJTU’s Baby elephant robot adopts a
hybrid leg configuration. The HAA joint is connected to
the body frame in series, whereas both the HFE and KFE

joints are realized by a special parallel mechanism. Com-
pared to its serial or parallel counterparts, the hybrid
mechanism can support a bigger payload and has a larger
workspace. In addition, there are three passive DOFs on
the ankle, which enables the robot to adapt to complex
ground environments very well. A novel motor-com-
bined hydraulic actuator called “Hy-Mo” was designed to
actuate the joints. The electrical motor controls the screw
valve inside the cylinder to obtain the given motion,
while the output power of the cylinder is provided by
the hydraulic pump. Each Hy-Mo actuator can provide
a push or pull force of up to 7500 N. Compared to the
traditional hydraulic system, there are no servo-valves,
accumulators, filters, or coolers for the Hy-Mo actuation
system.

Recently, the China North Vehicle Institute (CNVI)
also developed a hydraulically actuated quadruped
robot (cited from noveri.norincogroup.com.cn). The
robot was designed to perform difficult tasks, such as

transportation and detection in mountainous areas. The
detailed specifications of SCalf-H, HIT [27], SJTU Baby
elephant [28], and CNVI quadruped robots are shown in
Table 2.

2.1.5 SPOT Mini, Laikago, Jueying, and Other Electric
Quadruped robots
Some versatile legged robots, such as Spot Mini
(launched in July 2019), Laikago (in May 2019), and Juey-
ing (in November 2019), have been made commercially
available. These robots might lead to breakthroughs in
the translation of more legged robots from laboratory to
market as developers aim to create competitive products.
Spot Mini. The Spot Mini quadruped robot developed
by Boston Dynamics is shown in Figure 5(a) (cited from
www.bostondynamics.com). The SPOT Mini robot can
climb stairs and traverse rough terrain with unprec-
edented ease. The trotting speed reaches up to 1.6 m/s,
and the payload capacity is about 14 kg. Boston Dynamics

of the robot using customized application programs, and
the software platform of Spot Mini provides access to
vision navigation. Therefore, the application program can
access the perception data. Recently, Boston Dynamics
launched the latest SPOT Mini robot, which contains one
arm, one SPOT CAM system, and an additional power
source. The arm has six DOFs and its payload is 4 kg. The
arm can be used to open doors and manipulate objects.
The SPOT CAM includes a color feed and one optional
pan-tilt-zoom camera, providing the robot with better
situational awareness. The additional power source pro-
vides regulated power and an Ethernet breakout for easy
attachment of custom and third-party payloads.

Laikago. The Laikago quadruped robot, shown in Fig-
ure 5(b), was developed by Unitree Robotics (cited from
www.unitree.cc). It was designed to help normal people
with tasks like carrying objects or to act as a companion.
Each leg has three DOFs, and thus the whole robot has 12
high-performance motors. The weight of the robot with
the battery is about 22 kg. The payload is more than 9 kg,
the outline dimensions are about 0.55 m x 0.35 m x 0.6 m
(length x width x height), the maximum speed is 1.4 m/s,
and the maximum climbing slope is more than 20°. The
robot is very stable, and it can remain stable on uneven
surfaces and when kicked. Its successor, the Aliengo
quadruped robot, can even carry out very daunting tasks,
such as doing a backflip.

Jueying. The Jueying quadruped robot, pictured in Fig-
ure 5(c), was developed by Deep Robotics (cited from
www.deeprobotics.cn). The weight of the robot is 40 kg,
the maximum payload is 10 kg, the outline dimensions
He and Gao Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:79

are 0.85 mx0.5 mx0.65 m (length x width x height),
and the maximum speed is more than 7 km/h. This robot
can perform trotting and galloping gaits, and it can run
and jump on unstructured terrains. Since the control
period is approximately 0.5 ms, the robot can adapt
quickly to unexpected disturbances such as contact colli-
sions. It is also capable of adjusting the position and pose
of the torso to avoid falling down. Moreover, the Jueying
robot has great versatility and can carry out some com-
plicated tasks such as heading a ball and jumping through
a ring of fire.

In addition, there are other electric quadruped robots
in China. For example, the National University of
Defense Technology developed a small electric quad-
ruped robot, XDog [29], as seen in Figure 5(d). The
XDog’s weight without the battery is about 15 kg. The
outline dimensions are about 0.4 mx0.3 mx0.3 m
(length x width x height). Each leg has three active DOFs
and one passive prismatic DOF. The parallel mechanism
is used for the design of the electric quadruped robot.
Furthermore, the Beijing Institute of Technology devel-
oped a leg-wheel robot with parallel legs, named BIT-
NAZA, which is pictured in Figure 5(e) (cited from www.
bit.edu.cn). Each leg is a 6-DOF parallel Stewart plat-
form. Its walking speed is about 4 km/h. Owing to the
high stiffness of parallel legs, the ratio of the payload to
the weight reaches up to 1.875, which is much greater
than other electronic quadruped robots with serial legs.

2.2 Hexapod Robots

2.2.1 Lauron-V

The Lauron-V hexapod walking robot developed by
the FZI Research Center for Information Technol-
ogy is shown in Figure 6. Its outline dimensions are
0.9 mx0.8 mx0.84 m (length x width x height), its
weight is 42 kg with the batteries, and its maximum
payload is approximately 10 kg. Table 3 shows the main

technical specifications of Lauron-V. Compared to its
previous versions, Lauron-I through Lauron-lV, each leg
of Lauron-V has an additional (fourth) rotational joint.
Therefore, the robot can change the pose of any of its
feet to optimize the load distribution [30]. In addition,
each leg has a passive DOF with a spring damper. The
Lauron-V robot can traverse large obstacles with a slope
larger than 25° and maintain its balance on an incline
of 43° [31]. The robot is also able to manipulate objects
with its two front legs. The Lauron robot has a behavior-
based control system, which enables the robot to walk in
unstructured environments without accurate planning.

2.2.2 Crabster 200

The Crabster200 hexapod walking robot was developed
by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology
(KIOST) for seabed surveying and underwater preci-
sion work in coastal areas. The Crabster200 robot is able
to resist hydraulic pressure of up to 25 bar. The robot is
2.42 mx 2.45 mx 1.16 m (length x width x height). The
weight of the robot is approximately 300 kg, and it has a
maximum speed of 0.5 m/s. There are two 7-DOF arm-
combined legs and four 4-DOF dedicated legs as shown
in Figure 7 [32]. Table 4 gives the technical specifications
of Crabster200 [32, 33]. The geometrical parameters
of each leg were designed according to biological data
of crabs. Moreover, each leg has an additional shoulder
pitch joint so that the body posture can be adjusted to
adapt to creep inclines and to optimize the load distribu-
tion in a shallow sea with high tidal current.

2.2.3 Octopus, Hexabot-IV, and HIT Hexapod Robots

Pictured in Figure 8, both the Octopus [34] and Hexabot-
IV [6] hexapod robots with high payloads were developed

to quadruped walking robots, hexapod robots can accept
higher payloads and achieve greater stability, which
facilitates operation and transportation in unstructured
environments. Each leg of the Octopus robot is a 3-DOF
parallel mechanism. There is a passive spherical joint in

the ankle of each leg. The parallel mechanism has one
universal-prismatic (UP) limb and two universal-pris-
matic-spherical (UPS) limbs. Three prismatic pairs are
active joints. The whole robot is a double parallel struc-
ture, which provides high load capacity, load-to-weight
ratio, and stiffness. Moreover, the robot body is isotropic,
which gives it high kinematic dexterity and good obstacle
avoidance. Its weight is about 200 kg, and the maximum
payload of the robot is more than 500 kg. The maximum
climbing slope is approximately 25°, and it can traverse
obstacles with a height of up to 400 mm.

The Hexabot-IV [6] is a hexapod walking robot
intended to carry rescue equipment such as firefight-
ing hose nozzles, electric drills, or manipulators. Its
outline dimensions are about 1.1 mx0.72 mx1m
(length x width x height) in the standard standing
position. The weight of the Hexabot-IV is 270 kg with
two sets of battery packages, the maximum payload
is more than 50 kg, and the speed reaches up to 0.54
m/s. To lower the leg inertia, a parallel mechanism

PM with three limbs: a revolute-universal (RU) limb
and two revolute-universal-spherical (RUS) limbs. The
lower part is a spatial multilinkage mechanism. Thus,
the leg has a serial—parallel hybrid mechanism. Fur-
thermore, both the actuation and control systems are
located in the body frame and are well protected from
harsh environments.

The HIT hexapod robot [35], pictured in Figure 8(c),
was designed to perform transportation and perception
tasks on the lunar surface. The RRRS serial configuration
is adopted for the leg. Each leg has three active DOFs
and a passive spherical joint on the ankle joint. The ratio
of the payload to the weight is 0.46. The robot can walk
using crab-type, ant-type, and mixture-type gaits.

3 Mechanism

Similar to the skeletal system of mammals, the mecha-
nisms of multilegged robots determine the basic proper-
ties of the robotic system, such as mobility, workspace,
and singularity. The biological bone system has inspired
the mechanism design of many multilegged robots. A
biological configuration may lead to large amounts of
kinematic mechanisms with serial, parallel, or hybrid
topologies for a given motion pattern [36]. Generally
speaking, serial kinematic mechanisms (SKMs) have
larger workspace and dexterity, whereas parallel kin-
ematic mechanisms (PKMs) have higher stiffness and
payload capacity. Only a small number of multilegged
robots use pure serial or parallel topologies. For exam-
ple, ANYmal [3] and HyQ2Max [15] quadruped robots
have pure serial leg mechanisms. PKMs are typically used
for the leg structures of high-payload mobile robots [7,
8]. The serial—parallel hybrid mechanism has greater
rigidity than the SKM with the same DOF and a larger
workspace than the PKM with the same DOF [36]. For
some disaster rescue tasks, multilegged robots need both
static and dynamic gaits. Furthermore, the actuation and
control systems of robotic machines should be protected
from potentially harsh environments. A hybrid leg mech-
anism can be a suitable solution [6]. Table 5 shows the
leg configurations of the selected legged robots. Under-
lining denotes the active joint. The subscripts r, p, and y
denote the roll, pitch, and yaw motion characteristics,
respectively. R denotes the output joint of the four-link-
age mechanism.

There are two main factors that need to be consid-
ered for the rigid mechanism design of legged robots:
1) minimizing the leg inertia, and 2) facilitating the
protection of the actuation and control systems. For
conventional serial manipulators, each actuator is
directly mounted on each joint, and thus the inertia of
distal links increases greatly. To decrease the leg iner-
tia, the dual coaxial motor design is usually adopted
for driving the HFE and KFE joints as shown in Fig-
ure 9(a) [37]. Two motors for actuating the HFE and
KFE joints are mounted co-axially on the hip joint. The
KFE motor actuates the knee joint by a four-bar linkage
mechanism. In fact, this kind of leg configuration can
be regarded as a five-bar PKM with 2 DOF as shown
in Figure 9(b). The key element of this mechanism is

a pantograph configuration. From the standpoint of
bionics, the pantograph mechanism can mimic the
main kinematic features of the mammalian leg, so it
is often used in the leg design of walking robots [38].
Furthermore, the pantograph can maintain the rela-
tive angular orientation between the proximal and dis-
tal leg segments during most of a stride cycle [39]. In
addition, the chain drive is also used for the motion
transmission from the hip joint to the knee joint. For
example, both Cheetah 3 [25] and StarlETH [20] adopt
a chain drive for the knee joint. The chain transmission
enables the knee joint to rotate along the positive or
negative directions as demonstrated in Figure 9(c), thus
enlarging the motion range of the knee joint. In order
to protect the actuation and control systems, PKMs are
usually adopted for concentrating all actuators at the
main body. For instance, 18 motors were all placed on
the body frame of the Hexabot-IV robot, and the HAA,

HFE, and KFE joints were actuated by a 3-DOF PKM
[6], as shown in Figure 8(b).

Recently, more and more compliant mechanisms have
been introduced into legged robotics because these
flexible systems are perfectly suited to interact with
various environments and to handle uncertainties or
disturbances such as ground contact collisions. The mul-
tisegment leg with compliant elements is an effective
biological method to design highly dynamic multilegged
robot systems. Leg compliance facilitates long-distance
running and improves energy efficiency [40]. There are
four possible designs for compliant legs, as seen in Fig-
ure 10. The first design is a telescopic/prismatic leg
design, such as Raibert’s MIT Quadruped robot [41] and
Scout II robot [42]. For instance, each leg of Scout I con-
sists of only an active hip joint and a passive prismatic
joint with a damped spring. Using passive dynamics,
Scout II can perform bounding and running gaits. Typi-
cal examples of the two-segment design are KOLT [43]
and StarlETH [20] quadruped robots. The knee joint of
KOLT [43] is actuated by a brushless motor and a pneu-
matic spring, which produce leg flexion and extension,
respectively. The pneumatic spring provides the neces-
sary leg compliance at landing and allows elastic energy

to be stored. The StarlETH robot adopts high-compliance
series elastic actuators with linear compression springs,
as seen in Figure 11 [20, 44]. This mechanism improves
the robustness against impacts. Furthermore, by tuning
the joint stiffness, the linear compliant mechanism can
exploit the natural dynamics of the legged robotic system
and therefore the energy consumption can be reduced.
The Cheetah-Cub robot adopts the third and fourth
configurations [40]. In terms of the third design (Fig-
ure 10(c)), there is a diagonal spring spanning the pan-
tograph which provides a leg-extension force at all times.
The third design is called the SLP mechanism (spring-
loaded pantograph), and the fourth design is called the
ASLP mechanism (advanced SLP). Using the ASPL leg
design, the Cheetah-cub robot can self-stabilize through

open-loop control. In particular, the Froude number of
the Cheetah-cub robot reaches up to 1.3, which means
that it was nearly the fastest among all quadruped robots
below 30 kg when it was created.

4 Actuation

The highly dynamic legged robotic system puts for-
ward demanding requirements for actuators, such as
high robustness against impacts, accurate velocity con-
trol, low-impedance force control, and high power den-
sity [10]. Dynamic gaits, such as running, require high
stride frequency and low duty factor. From the theory of
momentum conservation, the relationship between the
total vertical impulse F, and gravity G can be written as

T

[tac = er, (1)

0

where T is the period of cyclic locomotion. From Eq.
(1), it is found that the ground reaction force increases
with the decrease of the duty factor. In other words, the
ground reaction force increases with the increase of
speed [45]. The maximum reaction force on each leg is
approximately 2.6 times the weight when a dog is running
at 9 m/s [46]. To meet the requirement of high output
torque, different kinds of actuators with high power den-
sity, including hydraulic and electric actuators, have been
developed. Among the legged robots listed in Table 4, the

Page 12 of 30

HyQ2Max, HyQReal, and Baby elephant robots adopt
hydraulic actuation, and the other robots use electric
motors. For dynamic locomotion of legged robots, there
are mainly three types of actuation technologies, namely
1) hydraulic actuation for the HyQ series of robots [15—
19], 2) quasi-direct drive (QDD) for the Cheetah series of
robots [21—24], and 3) serial elastic actuation (SEA) for
the StarlETH series of robots [10, 20].

4.1 Hydraulic Actuation
Hydraulic actuators can provide extremely high power
density and are naturally robust against impulsive load.
Many kinds of legged robots from Boston Dynamics,
such as BigDog, LS3, and Atlas, use hydraulic actuators
[47], as seen in Figure 12 (left). There are some advan-
tages of hydraulic actuators, like strong robustness to
impacts, high power, and great force density. Hydraulic
actuators are naturally robust against impacts because
impulsive load energy is easily absorbed by hydraulic oil
[48]. Hydraulic actuators can provide both high power
density and high-level force controllability owing to a
high-frequency servo valve with precise pressure sen-
sors [49]. In addition, it is easier to construct high DOF
machines using the hydraulic actuation system, which is
very important for the future applications of multilegged
robots.

Multilegged robots without arms do not have manipu-
lation capabilities. Recently, a quadruped robot with two

6-DOF hydraulically actuated arms, HyQ2Centaur [15,
50], was proposed. The arms have low inertia with high
payload capability because most of the hydraulic actua-
tion systems are located in the body frame. For robots
actuated by electrical motors, it is very challenging to
build a robot system with many DOFs and high-force
distal links. However, hydraulic legged robots are usu-
ally much larger and heavier than their electric counter-
parts, which is one of the drawbacks to the scalability of
hydraulic actuation systems. Besides, hydraulic actuators
also tend to be energetically inefficient because of the
fluid viscous loss and internal leakage of the servo valve
[51]. The Baby elephant quadruped robot [28] adopts a
novel “Hy-Mo” actuator which combines a hydraulic cyl-
inder and servo motor. There is no servo valve for the
hydraulic actuation system. A small servo motor with a
high-resolution encoder is adopted to control the output
position of the cylinder, as seen in Figure 12 [52]. It was
found that the leakage of the Hy-Mo hydraulic system is
only 10% of the system with a servo valve [28].

4.2 Quasi-direct Drive (QDD)

Thanks to recent advances in electric actuators,
the power mass density of servo motors has greatly
increased. However, high power is only possible at the
range of high speed where the output torque is relatively
low. A harmonic reducer with a high reduction ratio is
usually adopted to increase the torque density of the
servo motor at low speeds. However, the high gear reduc-
tion results in the increase of passive impedance, includ-
ing the reflected inertia, friction, and damping. The joint
mechanical impedance is proportional to the square of
the reduction ratio [43]. Joints with high reduction ratios
do not have back drivability. Without this ability, it is dif-
ficult to obtain high bandwidth torque control. The ideal
state of joint impedance is that the joint acts approxi-
mately as a free joint (without considering the parasitic
torque) when it is not actuated by the electric motor
[43]. The MIT Cheetah robot introduced a new actuation
paradigm (ie., “proprioceptive electric actuators”) for
legged robots. It shows that impressively fast, dynamic
legged robots (maximum speed up to 6.4 m/s [22]) can
be actuated with electric motors given the right design
approach [53]. This actuation strategy has also demon-
strated remarkable efficiency, with the COTs of the MIT
Cheetah robots being similar to mammalian COTs [21,
24, 54]. The Cheetah series of robots adopts custom-
designed high-torque-density (mass-specific torque)
electric motors with very low gear reduction to improve
the load capacity and low-speed efficiency. For example,
the reduction ratios of the planetary gears for Cheetah 2
and 3 are 5.8:1 and 7.67:1, respectively [24]. These actua-
tors with very low reduction ratios are called quasi-direct

Page 13 of 30

drive (QDD) actuators. A QDD actuator can obtain
excellent “transparency, a characteristic which means
the reflected inertia of the actuator is much smaller than
the output inertia [55]. This is critical for dynamic loco-
motion. Besides, the torque control based on the current
control of the electric motor can be performed at very
high bandwidths because the output torque is equivalent
to the regulation of the motor current. Thus, each actua-
tor has only one position sensor, no force or torque sen-
sors, and relatively simple transmission.

For QDD actuators, the development of high torque
density motors is very important. There are two key
evaluation indices for electric motors, i.e., peak specific
torque K,, for instantaneous performance and thermal
specific torque K,, for steady performance [56], which are
denoted by

Ky = at, (2)
m

Ks =| (3)
ts — m RnR’

where K,, i,, m, Ry, and R denote the torque constant,
peak current, motor’s mass, thermal resistance, and elec-
trical resistance. These two measures are directly related
to the gap radius of the motor [57]. Figure 13 shows the
change of K,, and K,, with respect to the gap radius for
some motors commonly used in legged robots. Although
QDD actuators have been successfully used for small
legged robots such as the Cheetah robots, the proprio-
ceptive electric actuator with low gear reduction ratio
cannot meet the actuation require-ments of large-scale

legged robots.

 

4.3 Serial Elastic Actuation (SEA)

To compensate for the low torque output of the direct
drive system, high gear reduction is often used to pro-
duce the low speed/high torque characteristics desir-
able in most legged robot applications. However, gear
reduction yields significant friction and reflected inertia
at the output shaft, and thus the actuator’s impedance
becomes extremely large. By adding series elasticity to
these conventional systems as in Figure 14(a), we can
attain a force-controllable actuator with low impedance,
low friction, and good bandwidth and thus achieve high-
quality force control [58]. By measuring the compliant
element’s deflection, the output torque can be calculated
using Hooke’s Law. Accordingly, the output torque can
be controlled by spring deflection. In the meantime, the
elastic element can store energy and increase peak power
while the spring and servo motor do work in the same

direction. Besides, the compliant element can protect the
gearbox from being damaged during impact.

The implementation of SEA turns the torque control
into a position control case. Figure 14(b) shows a typical
SEA control architecture [10], which is a cascade control-
ler including the inner torque and outer position control
loops. There is a PID controller, friction compensation,
and a feed-forward term for the torque control loop. In
Figure 14(b), ries, @,, 6,, and k denote the desired torque,
joint position, gear position, and the SEA stiffness coef-
ficient. There are usually two position sensors for meas-
uring 6; and @,. Therefore, the real output torque 7 can
be computed according to the k value and the spring
deflection (i.e., the difference between 0, and Q,). How-
ever, the SEA actuators have some detriments owing to
the substantial delay and limited bandwidth in the posi-
tion control, especially when legged robots run at high
speeds. Quadruped robots actuated by SEA actuators do
not have the actuation performance necessary to execute
the sorts of dynamic maneuvers like high-speed running
which have been demonstrated on the MIT Cheetah
robots and the hydraulic robots from Boston Dynamics
[53].

5 Perception

5.1 Sensors

There are two groups of commonly used sensors,
namely proprioceptive sensors for measuring the states
of each joint and the robot body and exteroceptive sen-
sors for measuring environmental information, as seen
in Figure 15. The former group includes encoders, iner-
tial measurement units (IMUs), and torque sensors.
The environmental information measured by the lat-
ter group consists of geometrical parameters such as
the outline dimensions of an obstacle, the slope of the
ground, and physical parameters, such as contact force,
temperature, humidity. To measure these geometri-
cal parameters, both visual and non-visual sensors are
adopted. Common visual sensors include binocular
cameras and RGB-D (red-green-blue-depth) cameras.
Binocular vision usually employs two CCD (charge-
coupled device) or CMOS (complementary metal oxide
semiconductor) sensors to perceive a single three-
dimensional image of its surroundings. RGB-D cameras
(such as Intel Realsense) can capture visual RGB images
along with per-pixel depth information, which can be
transformed into the coordinates of point clouds. RGB
cameras rely on either active stereo or time-of-flight
sensing to estimate the depths of a large number of pix-
els. However, RGB-D cameras can provide sensing for a
limited distance (less than 5 m), and the depth estima-
tion is noisy (typically about 3 cm at 3 m depth) [59].
Besides, vision sensor data are easily contaminated by

illumination. Thus, RGB-D cameras are mainly suitable
for indoor dense 3D modeling. Non-visual sensors usu-
ally obtain a 3D point cloud by measuring distances,
such as in the cases of radar, LiDAR (light detection
and ranging), and ultrasonic sensors, the measuring
precision of which is higher than visual sensors [14].
In addition, to sense environmental physical parame-
ters, such as contact force, a multiaxis force and torque
sensor is often mounted on the body or at the end of
the leg since force perception is very important to the
dynamic control of legged robots.

Multisensor fusion is an important trend for intel-
ligent legged robots. For instance, the BigDog robot
includes a number of different sensors, such as IMU,
3D camera, odometer, and GPS to perform state esti-
mation [60]. Each sensor has its advantages and its
share of disadvantages, such as LiDAR’s failure in rain,
the short range of the ultrasonic sensor, and the low
angular resolution of radar, which makes it necessary
to employ a suite of sensors when designing naviga-
tion systems to overcome the limitations of each sensor
alone [61]. For example, on uneven terrain, geometrical
information (such as a 3D point cloud) from visual or
non-visual sensors is contaminated by system vibra-
tion and the rotation and translation of the legged
robot body. The pose noise must be eliminated through
robot pose compensation. The IMU sensor is usually
mounted on the legged robot to estimate the legged
robot’s pose. The IMU sensor consists of 3-axis gyro
sensors and 3-axis acceleration sensors, and thus the
estimated output state is 6-DOF angular velocity and
acceleration. Visual perception fused with IMU sensing
is very important to guarantee the stable operation of a
legged robot [62].

5.2 Mapping

The autonomous locomotion of legged robots is a com-
plicated task ranging from low-level motor control to
high-level cognitive processing [63]. The autonomous
ability of the legged robot is related to the global locomo-
tion planning in the long range and the fully autonomous
reaction in the local area. In this paper, “long range” is
defined as an activity that takes the legged robot beyond
the horizon of the robot’s environment sensors, and the
“local area” is the scope within a gait period. The for-
mer mainly depends on the perception of geometrical
parameters, whereas the latter (to be further discussed
in Section 6) depends on kinematic and dynamic mod-
eling and the perception of physical parameters, as seen
in Figure 15. The state of the art regarding the mapping
and localization of legged robots is presented below and
in the following subsection.

The locomotion performance of a legged robot heavily
depends on mapping for navigation and planning. Point
cloud data are obtained by stereo vision [64] or laser sen-
sor [62]. The raw data of 3D point clouds cannot be used
directly for mapping because they require a large amount
of memory. Thus, point clouds must be changed into
a grid map, which means that the world is divided into
a regular, two-dimensional grid of evenly spaced cells.
Gutmann et al. [65] presented a grid map including the
height information of the floor covering the cell area.
Rekleitis et al. [66] proposed irregular triangular meshes
(ITMs) to represent the environment. ITMs inherently
support concave geological structures like overhangs and
caverns, unlike digital elevation maps (DEMs). Ishigami
et al. [67] presented an elevation map with cylindrical
coordinated terms, called C7DEM, which achieves range-
dependent resolution for terrain mapping and generates
He and Gao Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:79

a detailed terrain representation near the robot. Khan
et al. [68] proposed a rectangular cuboid approxima-
tion framework (RMAP) using axis-aligned rectangular
cuboids (RC), which is able to generate probabilistic 3D
representations with multiresolution capabilities.

Compared to wheeled or tracked robots, legged robots
are better able to traverse obstacles in harsh environ-
ments. Legged robots have more choices, such as step-
ping on, stepping over, or bypassing obstacles. Thus,
the map for the legged robot’s locomotion must contain
explicit geometric features of the partial terrain. How-
ever, few works involve this process. Recently, Chai and
Gao [69] presented a novel geometric feature grid map
(GFGM) to describe the terrain for legged robots, which
is useful for checking obstacles and finding paths in clut-
tered environments.

5.3 Localization

Localization is another key capability for autonomous
legged robots and is typically performed using a combi-
nation of odometry (from joint encoders or visual sen-
sors) and inertial sensing (from IMUs) [60]. When legged
robots work in an unexplored environment, simultane-
ous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an important
technique. SLAM is a solution that allows a mobile robot
to incrementally build a consistent map of an unknown
environment while simultaneously obtaining the loca-
tion of the robot within this map [70]. Either a camera or
a laser can be used as the primary sensor for the imple-
mentation of SLAM, with the corresponding methods
called Visual-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM, respectively.
There are two main computational solutions to the
SLAM problem, i.e., the extended Kalman filter (EKF-
SLAM) [71] and Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (Fast-
SLAM) [72]. Presently, computational complexity, data
association, and environment representation are three
main research areas in the development of SLAM. Many
algorithms relevant to these research areas have already
been developed, such as UKF-SLAM [73], Graph-SLAM
[74], Mono-SLAM [75], and Co-SLAM [76]. Although
SLAM has reached a state of considerable maturity, it
is still a great challenge to generate consistent maps of
large areas [14]. However, legged robots frequently enlist
SLAM to deal with large unstructured areas such as plan-
etary surfaces and disaster scenarios [77].

Multisensor data fusion algorithms considering legged
robots’ characteristics may be available for the solution of
large-scale SLAM problems. The HyQ robot can perform
goal-oriented navigation within unknown harsh terrain
using IMUs and RGB-D vision [63]. A novel multisen-
sory data fusion algorithm has been exploited for the
DLR Crawler hexapod robot, which fuses measurements
from an IMU, 3D visual odometer, and 3D leg odometer

Page 16 of 30

[64]. The leg odometry measurements enable the robot
to sense areas with low visibility, such as shadowy areas.
Compared to using only a single sensor, multisensor
fusion algorithms improve both robustness and pose esti-
mation accuracy. However, the error model for the leg
odometer needs to be further developed to automatically
adjust the weights of incorrect odometry measurements
in the fusion process.

6 Control
6.1 Gait Patterns
The gait is a manner of walking or running on foot. There
are three technical terms to describe the gaits of legged
robots, namely stride, duty factor, and relative phase [78].
The stride is the distance of leg movement during one
cycle. The duty factor of one leg is the ratio of the stance
duration to the whole period. Compared to an arbitrarily
chosen reference leg, there is a delay before setting down
another leg. The relative phase of one leg is defined as
the ratio of the delay to the whole period. The gait can be
classified as walking or running. The duty factors of walk-
ing gaits are generally greater than 0.5, whereas those of
running gaits are generally less than 0.5. For example,
trotting, cantering, and galloping are all running gaits.
There are also symmetric and asymmetric gaits, which
are usually used by quadrupedal mammals for slow and
fast running, respectively. For instance, the trot and the
gallop are the most common running gaits used by quad-
ruped mammals. The symmetric trot gait is predominant
in low and moderate speeds, whereas the asymmetric
gallop gait is preferred in higher speed running. Fig-
ure 16 shows common gait graphs for quadruped robots
[79]. The stance phases are drawn as green bars whilst
the swing phases are drawn as empty bars. For hexapod
robots, there are usually three kinds of gaits, namely
alternating tripod, wave, and free gaits [80]. The alternat-
ing tripod gait, whose duty factor is about 0.5, is typically
selected for high speed walking on relatively flat terrain.
The wave gait is more suitable for lower speed walking on
difficult terrain, and its duty factor is more than 0.7.
Despite the diversity in morphology, mammals of dif-
ferent sizes have similar gait characteristics, i.e., dynamic
similarity, which gives important inspiration for the
design of legged robots. First, they tend to adopt the
same gait while moving with equal Froude numbers [78].
The Froude number is written as F.=v*/gl. Here, v, g,
and L are the velocity, gravitational acceleration, and the
height of the hip joint at standing. The Froude number
has widespread applications in the biomechanics of leg-
ged locomotion [81]. For example, quadrupedal mam-
mals usually change gait from trotting to galloping at a
Froude number of 2-3 [78]. Second, though quadruped
mammals and hexapod insects have different amounts of

legs, there are similar ground contact behaviors for two
legs in quadruped mammals and three legs in insects,
just like one leg in human beings [82]. The whole-body
mechanics in two-, four-, and six-legged runners can
be remarkably similar, despite variations in body form
or morphology [83]. This characteristic enables the leg
design and control of both quadruped and hexapod
robots to be implemented using the same method such as
the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model [84].
For those gaits that use the support legs one at a time,
such as trotting with diagonal pairs, pacing with lateral
pairs, and bounding with front and rear pairs, one-leg
algorithms can be used to control quadruped robots [85]
and hexapod robots [86].

6.2 Gait Control
Control and motion planning of legged robots faces sev-
eral challenges, such as high-dimensional systems with

Page 17 of 30

floating base and redundant DOFs and whole-body mul-
ticontact interactions with unknown environments [87].
Here, motion planning refers to the aforementioned local
area within a gait period. To lower control complexity,
dynamic locomotion is usually decomposed into several
simpler tasks such as body stabilization, leg motion plan-
ning, and ground reaction force control. Many meth-
ods have been developed for gait control, which can be
grouped into three categories, namely kinetostatics-
based methods, dynamics-based methods, and model-
free methods.

Kinetostatics-based control methods are mainly
exploited for static gaits to provide center-of-gravity
(COG) projection [88] and find the zero moment point
(ZMP) [89]. The ZMP is an extension of the COG
method including the inertia force, and it is a point on
the ground where the resultant moment of the multi-
legged robot is zero. When the ZMP is located within
the supporting polygon, the legged robot is stable. The
ZMP criterion is effective for controlling the low-speed
walking of quadruped [90] and hexapod [91] robots. To
further evaluate the stability degree, the ESM (energy sta-
bility margin) [92], CSSM (compliant static stability mar-
gin) [93], F-ASM (force-angle stability margin) [94], and
DSM (dynamic stable margin) [95] were proposed for the
gait control of legged robots. However, these kinetostat-
ics-based approaches are not suitable for running gaits,
such as trotting and galloping. This is because there is no
obvious polygon for the ZMP calculation when legged
robots are running with high speed. Furthermore, from
the energy consumption perspective, the ZMP control
method is not economical because the legged robot’s
torso with a large mass has to be accelerated and deceler-
ated in each gait stride.

Compared to kinetostatics-based control, the latter two
methods are more suitable for the high-speed control of
legged robots. This paper focuses on the control of highly
dynamic locomotion. The present statuses of dynamics-
based and model-free control methods will be surveyed
in Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. These two kinds of control
methods have been widely used for highly dynamic leg-
ged robots, as seen in Table 6. Dynamics-based control
methods include the SLIP model [6, 43, 47, 56, 85, 96, 97],
virtual model control (VMC) [98, 99], model predictive
control (MPC) [24, 100, 101], whole-body control (WBC)
[3, 10, 20, 87, 102-104], and so on. Model-free methods
include the commonly used central pattern generator
(CPG) control [17, 40, 105-108], sim-to-real reinforce-
ment learning (RL) [3, 109, 110], and so on. A CPG can
utilize a legged robot's inertia to minimize energy con-
sumption and simultaneously allow for free-gaits that are
robust to disturbances. The CPG-based control method
has also been adopted to generate dynamic gaits [40, 105,

* The mass is estimated from the data in Refs. [1] and [22]

107]. Sim-to-real RL [3, 110] has recently been exploited
for the control of multilegged robots. For example, using
this compelling method, the ANYmal quadruped robot
achieved dynamic locomotion performances that could
not be obtained by conventional control approaches [3].

6.2.1 Dynamics-based Control

An important distinction between static and dynamic
gaits is the stability criterion. For dynamic gaits, the static
stability criterion such as ZMP is no longer suitable for
the state estimation of legged robots. Based on a fast
feedback loop, a legged robot obtains dynamic stability
by continuously moving the feet or the body. Gaits can
be regarded as the byproduct of preserving the stability
of the legged robot [111]. The dynamic stability criteria of
legged robots are still in question. Because the locomo-
tion of a legged robot is typical periodic motion, Poincare
return map analysis has been widely adopted to evaluate

locomotion stability [22, 112-114], from the relatively
simple SLIP control model [97] to more complicated
models involving specific configuration such as hybrid
leg mechanisms [6].

SLIP model. Animals have very distinct force and
motion patterns when they are running. During walk-
ing, the potential and kinetic energies of the torso
change in either a sinusoidal or out-of-phase manner.
Therefore, the changes of kinetic and potential ener-
gies can be described by a pendulum-like energy recov-
ery mechanism. Cavagna et al. [115] first proposed the
SLIP model to mimic the dynamic characteristics of a
variety of animals. SLIP is represented by a point mass
atop a spring as shown in Figure 17 [97], which is pas-
sive and conservative. A stride in the SLIP model con-
sists of the stance and flight phases. The body tracks a
ballistic trajectory under the influence of gravity, and
the springy leg adjusts the touchdown angle to swing

to the desired position in the flight phase. The mass
moves forward in the stance phase by compressing and
decompressing the spring. Raibert et al. [84, 85] pre-
sented three servo loops that controlled the running
speed, body attitude, and hopping height. Although
the controller is very simple, legged robots can obtain
robust dynamic gaits with high performance, such as
the trot [6, 43, 85], pronk [56, 96], and bound [85, 97].
Despite morphological and design differences, most of
these robots adopted the SLIP control method without
intense feedback [97]. Furthermore, if the SLIP model
is provided with suitable initial conditions, including
touchdown angle, the legged robot can tolerate small
disturbances without feedback control [116]. However,
the control precision of SLIP needs moderate improve-
ment, especially in tracking the desired velocity. The
fuzzy controller can learn the leg touchdown angles
and leg thrusts in one stride [117], and thus it has been
adopted to improve the velocity and height tracking
characteristics for legged locomotion [43].

Virtual model control (VMC). VMC, presented by
Pratt et al. [98], is an intuitive control scheme for legged
locomotion. Compared to SLIP, which highly depends
on tuning or optimization, the VMC has a virtual model
to generate the desired actuator torques. The VMC puts
virtual elements between contact points, such as the
spring, damper, dashpot, mass, latch, bearing, and non-
linear potential and dissipative field. There are three
obvious merits of the VMC. First, complex tasks can be
easily described using simple virtual components. For
instance, the HyQ uses the virtual model approach to
enact robot stabilization control. Two virtual spring-
damper components between the torso and the con-
tact surface are used for VMC modeling, as shown in
Figure 18 [99]. The virtual forces and moments are cal-
culated and then transformed to feedforward torques
for the joint actuation of supporting legs. Second, the
VMC needs relatively small amounts of computation.

Third, the VMC can be readily extended to perform
complex control tasks by using adaptive and learning
elements [118, 119], stiffness control [120], and active
impedance control [121, 122]. Recently, Gehring et al.
[123] established mappings from virtual forces and tor-
ques on the torso to virtual leg forces and then to joint
torques. They used this technique to realize the control
of the whole body of the StarlETH robot. Furthermore,
Xie et al. [124] presented a whole-body VMC method
for quadruped robot trotting with special attention to
rotation along the body’s diagonal line.

Model predictive control (MPC). MPC can be used to
solve mode-based optimization problems iteratively by
both considering the system’s current state and antici-
pating its future evolution [125]. When the timespan
between two hybrid events (such as touchdown or lift-
off) is considered, MPC can be used to optimize states
and control inputs for a finite horizon with some lin-
ear constraints and thus generate stable motions [126].
Typically, the objective function [127] at step i is
He and Gao Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:79
N-1

where x, denotes the system state, uw; denotes the control
policy at step i, P(x) is the terminal cost, and r(x; u;, j) is
the cost function. Given a nominal step period, the state
evolves as

N-1
xin = (an) + Y— roy, uj,/). (5)
j=i

At each time step, the optimization generates the best
u, being applied to the legged robot system. Convention-
ally, the MPC problem can be formulated as a quadratic
programming (QP) problem. Though MPC has been
widely adopted for ZMP optimization and footstep plan-
ning for humanoids [128], MPC is seldom exploited for
the gait planning of multilegged robots [1]. Recently,
the computational expense of online MPC methods has
been greatly decreased by using interior-point [129] and
active-set [130] solvers. Furthermore, thanks to recent
advancements in convex optimization [131] and its appli-
cations to MPC [132], open-source solvers, such as ECOS
[133] and qpOASES [134] can solve MPC problems rap-
idly and reliably. The MPC problem of Cheetah 2 can be
computed in 250 us by the qpOASES solver, which real-
izes online planning for autonomous running jumps over
obstacles with the speed of 2.4 m/s [1]. Carlo et al. [100]
found that an accurate instantaneous dynamic model is
more important than a highly accurate model of a legged
robot’s dynamics during the prediction horizon. There-
fore, the dynamic control of a multilegged robotic system
based on the MPC method can be formulated as a convex
optimization. For instance, Cheetah 3 [24, 101] employs
convex MPC to control the ground reaction forces and
achieves high robustness of dynamic locomotion at a
variety of speeds.

Whole-body control (WBC). The whole-body frame-
work developed by Khatib et al. [135, 136] is a very
appealing control architecture for complex tasks with
priorities between tasks. Although the implementation
that produces control signals of all active joints may be
a WBC problem [87], most studies approach WBC prob-
lems by considering the floating base inverse dynamics
[137]. The dynamic locomotion control of high-dimen-
sional multilegged robots usually decouples motion plan-
ning from motion control [138, 139]. The WBC facilitates
such decoupling because it is easy to fulfill multiple tasks
while simultaneously respecting the behaviors of the leg-
ged robot. Farshidian et al. [140] proposed a task space
decomposition method that eliminates the coupling
between contact force and non-contact controllers. The

Page 20 of 30

WBC formulates locomotion control as an optimiza-
tion problem considering the full dynamics of the leg-
ged robot, and then all joints’ desired motion tasks can
be achieved. However, solving the optimization problem
in real-time is still a great challenge because the com-
putational requirements are very high. To address this
challenge, the dynamics and constraints of the legged
robot can be formulated as linear constraints with con-
vex cost functions, such as a QP [141]. The combination
of searching for solutions in the null space of higher pri-
ority tasks and handling explicit inequality constraint
problems yields a relatively small QP problem as equal-
ity constraints are involved in the cascade of QPs [142].
Thus, the WBC coupled with hierarchical optimization
(HO) can be implemented in a legged robot with a real-
time control loop at the 1 kHz level. Recently, StarlETH
[20, 102-104] and ANYmal [10, 87], two fully torque-
controllable quadruped robots, achieved impressive loco-
motion performance using the WBC method. The robots
can traverse unperceived obstacles without the require-
ment of motion planning from the operator.

Compared to SLIP, VMC, and MPC, WBC has three
advantages by incorporating the full dynamics of the leg-
ged robot. First, it is capable of dealing with almost all
constraints, which is more difficult with the other meth-
ods [140, 142]. Second, there are no explicit trajectories
to be tracked at the joint level, which increases the com-
pliance of legged robots and decreases the complexity of
motion planning [20, 87]. Third, WBC realizes upper-
level control more easily because it provides an abstract
formulation for the planning [10, 102-104].

6.2.2 Model-free Control

It is clear that the above model-based methods have
obtained impressive control performance in multilegged
robots. However, there are still two main disadvantages:
(i) the limited detail used in the modeling inevitably
yields compromises in performance such as agility, com-
pliance, and energy efficiency; (ii) the development of
model-based controllers is extremely labor-intensive.
In model-free approaches, there is neither a kinematic
nor a dynamic model of the legged robot involved in the
control. An early model-free control method was the
CPG method. Recently, some learning models have been
incorporated in optimized controllers [3, 143]. Thanks to
the intrinsic simplicity of model-free methods, model-
free control is an appealing method for the dynamic loco-
motion control of multilegged robots.

Central pattern generator (CPG). It is universally
known that animal walking is primarily generated by a
combination of a CPG and reflexes [105]. The CPG con-
sists of layers of neuron pools coupled with oscillators
in the spinal cord, whose outputs are converted into
He and Gao Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:79

rhythmic control signals that drive the leg extensor and
flexor muscles [144]. The spinal reflexes are in charge of
the selection of gait patterns, the timing of swing and
stance activities, and the adjustment of CPG outputs
[107]. In robot control, the “reflex” refers to the joint
torque generation resulting from the sensor informa-
tion and the response as CPG phase adjustment based
on the sensory feedback to the CPG [105]. The CPG
controller can not only produce well-coordinated leg
movements but also accomplish gait transitions with
simple descending control signals [145]. Moreover, the
controller can use a neural oscillator (NO) with rein-
forcement learning to obtain parameters online [146]
and optimize various parameters [147]. A great deal of
previous research regarding the CPG model attempted
to generate dynamic locomotion, such as in the Tekken
1 and 2 [105-107], Cheetah-cub [40], HyQ [17], and
Baby elephant [108]. Recently, the design team of Tek-
ken robots used a leg loading feedback mechanism to
each CPG for the posture control of a new quadruped
model instead of vestibular feedback, as seen in Fig-
ure 19 [148]. Using the proposed CPG model with leg
loading feedback, robot gaits can autonomously tran-
sition from walking to trotting and then to transverse
galloping along with its acceleration or deceleration,
similarly to animals. Furthermore, interlimb coordina-
tion during gait transitions can be self-organized using
the CPG model with physical communication through-
out the body [143].

Page 21 of 30

There are two obvious trends for CPG control: (i) the
external sensory information, such as the robot torso’s
postures [105], touchdown feedback [107], and leg load-
ing [148], is applied to the CPG model to improve control
performance; (ii) the CPG is combined with another con-
trol method, such as inverse dynamics [17, 108], RL [143,
146, 147], or VMC [149]. There are also some issues that
need to be further studied. For example, CPG with feed-
back is likely to degrade the compliance of legged robots,
and the situation will get worse if position control is
adopted [127]. Nevertheless, CPGs provide an impressive
approach to generate gait trajectories by using the limit
cycle behavior of coupled NOs to produce joint control
signals in real time [150]. CPG-based control greatly
reduces the control dimensionality of legged robots while
remaining highly flexible to gait patterns.

Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL). RL_ has
obtained tremendous progress in recent years, and
many algorithms have been developed to cope with
autonomous locomotion problems [151-153]. These
are data-driven methods, which promise to avoid the
aforementioned limitations of model-based approaches.
However, there are two difficulties in applying RL to
locomotion control. First, RL typically requires weeks or
months of training to generate highly agile and efficient
algorithms [154]. Second, learning methods cannot be
directly applied to physical prototypes because of the pos-
sibility of sudden and chaotic behaviors during training
[152]. Simulations are appealing environments because

they can provide abundant data for machine learning.
Unfortunately, there exists a “reality gap” [155] between
real and simulated systems because of such factors as
unconsidered dynamics, incorrect model parameters,
and calculation errors [109]. The reality gap can be elimi-
nated by improving the simulation fidelity or the robust-
ness of the controller to variations. Lee and Park [156]
improved the simulation accuracy of a high-DOF legged
robot by inertial parameter identification. The robust-
ness can be obtained by a large amount of training that
involves numerous randomization aspects. For example,
Xue et al. [110] used dynamic randomization to develop
effective policies that can be transferred directly to the
real world. Tan et al. [109] achieved a robust controller
by adding perturbations in a compact observation space
and randomizing the physical environments. After learn-
ing in simulation, a quadruped robot called Minitaurs
can successfully implement dynamic gaits of trotting and
galloping in the real world. This method depends on the
analytical actuation model, which can be easily obtained
for the direct-drive actuator used in Minitaurs. However,
it is very difficult to obtain for complex actuators, such
as SEA and hydraulic actuators. Recently, Hwangbo et al.
[3] proposed an effective learning approach to deal with
a high-performance locomotion controller with SEA
actuators. This approach was successfully used for the
ANYmal quadruped robot. First, the physical parameters
of the robot were identified, and the uncertainties were
estimated. Second, an actuator net with complex actuator
dynamics was trained. Third, based on the models gener-
ated in the first two steps, the control policy was trained.
Finally, the trained policy was deployed directly on the
physical system, as seen in Figure 20.

6.3 Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is one of the most important parame-
ters to be minimized in the control of dynamic locomo-
tion. The energy efficiency is related to the gait pattern,

stride, and duty factor. Biological research on animals
shows that there exists an optimal speed for each kind of
gait pattern which leads to the lowest energy consump-
tion [157]. To achieve the optimal energy-saving mecha-
nism, animals usually select walking gaits at low Froude
numbers and running gaits at high Froude numbers
[158]. Furthermore, there exist resonant frequencies at
which the locomotion energy consumption is minimal.
Animals can keep their energy consumption at mini-
mum by tuning their body resonance when they change
their speeds [159]. Hoyt et al. [160] proposed a set of
relationships between the mechanics, gait parameters,
and energetics based on experimental data. On the basis
of research results on animals, the energy efficiencies of
multilegged robots have been greatly increased.

The total COT is a commonly-used metric for evaluat-
ing the energy efficiencies of animals and legged robots,
which is written as

COT = P/Wy, (6)

where P, W, and v are the robot's power, weight, and
speed, respectively [21]. The energy efficiencies of most
multilegged robots are still worse than their biologi-
cal counterparts, as seen in Figure 21. For instance, the
COT of the BigDog quadruped robot (COT = 15) is sig-
nificantly higher than animals of similar mass. In fact,
the conversion of electricity to mechanical energy is
much more efficient than the conversion of biological
energy to mechanical energy. Thus, it is possible for robot
designs to produce inefficiencies. To improve energy effi-
ciency, passive dynamics have been employed to design
legged robots, such as the Ranger robot from Cornell
University [161]. Although it obtained very high energy
efficiency (COT=0.19), the Ranger sacrificed agility
to maximize the passive dynamics. Legged robots with

more versatility, such as BigDog and ASIMO, are much
less efficient than animals of similar scale. Series elas-
tic elements have also been adopted to improve energy
efficiency. For example, the StarlETH [20] and ANYmal
[10] robots obtained COTs of 1.7 and 1.2, respectively, by
employing SEA actuators. There exist three major energy
losses, namely, heat losses of actuators, transmission
losses, and interaction losses with the environment. To
reduce these losses, Seok et al. [22] adopted a motor with
a large gap radius, a regenerative driver, and a low iner-
tia leg to design the Cheetah series robots. The Cheetah
robots obtained very low COTs, rivaling running animals
with similar masses [23, 25].

6.4 Software Architecture

The multilegged robot is a typical MMM robotic system,
and its software computing architecture is very compli-
cated. The hierarchical control architecture is usually
adopted for the control of multilegged robots. A typi-
cal tiered control architecture consists of high-level and
low-level controllers, as seen in Figure 22 [114]. The
high-level controller includes a gait pattern modulator
and a leg-trajectory generator. The former imposes an
intended gait-pattern on the gait pattern modulator, and
the latter offers a designed foot-end trajectory to the low-
level controller, i.e., the leg controller. The leg controller
realizes virtual leg compliance through active imped-
ance control [162] or proprioceptive impedance control
[114]. In the hierarchical architecture, low-level control
operates at much higher frequencies than high-level con-
trol. For instance, the real-time whole-body controller
of the ANYmal robot is timed by the CAN driver, which
communicates with the actuator units at 400 Hz. How-
ever, the commands are exchanged to a less time-critical

computing resources for future sensing, planning, and
navigation [25].

There are two basic hypotheses [112] for this tiered
control architecture. First, the continuous self-stabilizing
task of dynamic locomotion can be achieved by planning
the compliance of the virtual leg. Second, owing to the
equilibrium-point hypothesis [163], the modulation of
ground reaction force can be adjusted by designing the
foot-end trajectories of the stance phase. Thus, the con-
tact force control can be effectively achieved by penetrat-
ing the equilibrium position of the impedance control
to the ground surface. The most significant advantage of
the tiered control framework is that it has fewer control
parameters such as gait-patterns, locomotion speed, and
foot-end trajectories. Furthermore, all control param-
eters except the virtual ground-penetration depth can be
predetermined by preliminary experiments. The Cheetah
1 robot using this kind of control model with fixed con-
trol parameters can yield self-stabilizing trot-running at
speeds up to 6 m/s [113].

7 Future Research

In the above sections, the mechanism, actuation, percep-
tion, and control of highly dynamic multilegged robots
are surveyed, and many important research results
are presented. From this review, key topics for future
research on multilegged robots can be determined as
follows.

7.1 Mechanism and Actuation

In terms of mechanisms, bionic inspiration is still the
primary basis for design. There are three detailed factors
for design, namely actuation—transmission decoupling,
serial—parallel coupling, and rigid—flexible coupling, as
seen in Figure 23. Actuation—transmission decoupling
yields the low inertia leg and makes it easy for electrical
actuation devices to be protected from harsh environ-
ments. For a leg mechanism with serial—parallel hybrid
topology, the serial module enlarges the foot-end work-
space while the parallel module increases the stiffness.
The rigid—flexible coupling mechanism has the greatest
ability to handle uncertainties or disturbances like con-
tact collisions.

In terms of actuation, there exist QDD, SEA, and
hydraulic actuation methods, which can meet the basic
actuating requirements of highly dynamic multilegged
robots. However, actuation dynamics must be modeled
more precisely in the future, a process that depends on
attaining accurate physical parameters or force compen-
sation algorithms. Physical parameters can be identi-
fied by both experimental and simulation methods. For
instance, reinforcement learning is an effective method
to determine control parameters of actuation dynamics.

Because there exist time delays between force measure-
ment and dynamic response in the actuation process,
output torque error will inevitably be produced. For
simple actuators such as QDD, the delay model can be
derived, and thus the output error can be easily elimi-
nated by model-based force compensation. However, for
complex actuators, such as SEA and hydraulic cylinders
commonly used in large-scale legged robots, the mod-
els of force measurement delay and dynamic response,
and the stiffness and damping of the actuators are all
unknown. Therefore, the force compensation of complex
actuators is still a challenging issue for highly dynamic
multilegged robots.

7.2 Perception and Control

In terms of perception, there are two important aspects
that need to be further studied for highly dynamic mul-
tilegged robots, i.e, the improvement of adaptability
and multisensor fusion. Regarding the first aspect, the
perception algorithms used for other mobile robots like
wheeled or tracked robots cannot be directly used for
multilegged robots. For instance, a legged robot should
have the ability to step on, step over, or bypass obstacles,
which requires a map containing detailed geometric fea-
tures of the local terrain. However, few works concerning
wheeled or tracked robots establish such maps. Regard-
ing the second aspect, multisensor fusion includes not
only the fusion of multiple exteroceptive sensors, such as

 

 

LiDAR and a stereo camera but also the fusion between
exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors. For exam-
ple, the fusion of measurements from IMU with 3D leg
odometry and 3D visual odometry measurements from
3D vision can be used for robust pose estimation of mul-
tilegged robots in harsh outdoor environments. The com-
putation of leg odometry is based on a forward kinematic
model, which needs measurements from proprioceptive
sensors such as joint encoders.

In terms of control, there are two important conclu-
sions. First, the combination of the self-determination
of the multilegged robot and human supervision is still
the key to a breakthrough for the legged robot to perform
complex missions (Figure 24). The current state of mul-
tilegged robots’ technologies cannot meet the require-
ments for performing complex tasks in harsh outdoor
environments. The human-in-the-loop control mode is
a better choice for multilegged robots. The legged robot
obtains necessary information via fusion perception such
as vision-based and force-based fusion perception. This
information is used for both control planning of the mul-
tilegged robot and human decision-making. The opera-
tor will give orders to the multilegged robot according to
visual and haptic sensing. The control system of the leg-
ged robot consists of a high-level planner, low-level plan-
ner, and low-level controller, which autonomously carry
out mapping and localization, trajectory planning, active
impedance control, and so on.

Second, it is believed that the conventional control
architecture will not meet the requirements of future
intelligent legged robots. The traditional architecture
consists of communication and execution layers, which
can be realized by the robot operating system (ROS) and
the real-time operating system of the controller, such
as Linux, as seen in Figure 25. Three are three types of
information for the legged robot, i.e., the mission (such
as manipulating), human commands, and perception.
The behaviors of legged robots consist of the configura-
tion of the whole body as well as the motion character-
istics and trajectory characteristics of all end-effectors
of the torso and legs. Traditionally, the legged robot
obtains its behaviors by information modeling accord-
ing to methods mentioned in Sections 5 and 6. The

ROS realizes communication between the information
and the behaviors. Then the input of actuation can be
achieved according to kinematic and dynamic models
of legged mechanisms and the actuators. The control-
ler equipped with a real-time operating system, such
as Linux enables communication between the behav-
iors and the inputs. The whole process is shown in
Figure 26. However, with the development of artificial
intelligence, some novel control methods such as RL
have been used to improve the dynamic performance of
multilegged robots. Therefore, it is vital to the develop-
ment of legged robots to establish a new decision layer
in the ROS and Linux, which is called the brain of ROS
(BROS, see Figures 25, 26). The BROS is employed to
establish the relationship between the information and
the behaviors. First, the description and classification
of behaviors of multilegged robots must be studied, and
then the databases of configurations, motion, and tra-
jectory characteristics can be established. Second, the
description and classification of each kind of informa-
tion need to be proposed, which can form logic map-
ping from information to behaviors.

8 Conclusions

In recent years, multilegged robots have achieved
impressive advancements in dynamic performance.
However, they are still far from being significantly ver-
satile and robust. This paper addressed major points

that might lead to breakthroughs for multilegged
robots.

(1) Twenty-one typical multilegged robots were sur-
veyed, and the most appealing performances of
these robots were presented. It was noted that some
quadruped robots have recently entered the market,
which might help meet real commercial require-
ments and promote the development of key tech-
nologies.

(2) The commonly used serial and parallel configura-
tions of leg mechanisms were described and clas-
sified. The latest transmission structures and rigid—
flexible coupling structures were also presented.

(3) Three types of actuators-namely, hydraulic, QDD,
and SEA actuators-were analyzed. Since actuation
has a significant impact on many aspects of multi-
legged robots, this paper devoted special attention
to the three important functions of actuation: high
robustness against impacts, accurate velocity con-
trol, and low-impedance force control.

(4) Sensors and modeling methods used for perception
were reviewed. Studies concerning the mapping
and localization abilities of multilegged robots were
surveyed.

(5) Control methods were presented in terms of gait
pattern, control strategy, energy efficiency, and soft-
ware architecture. The control of highly dynamic
multilegged robots is another significant challenge,
and thus this paper paid particular attention to
the development trends of control strategies. Four
dynamics-based control methods and two model-
free control methods were illustrated in detail.

Although great research progress has been achieved
in the field of multilegged robots, there are many sig-
nificant problems that need to be further studied.

(1) Novel mechanisms with serial-parallel coupling,
rigid-flexible coupling, and actuation-transmission
decoupling topologies must be synthesized. Actua-
tion dynamics must be modeled more precisely in
the future.

(2) The adaptability improvement of perception mod-
eling and multisensor fusion are still open issues.
Control models with a combination of robot self-
determination and human supervision as well as
control architectures with the BROS system need
further study..
