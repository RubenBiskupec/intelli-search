Abstract

With the rapidly growing demand for large-scale online education and the advent of big data, numerous research
works have been performed to enhance learning quality in e-learning environments. Among these studies, adaptive
learning has become an increasingly important issue. The traditional classification approaches analyze only the
surface characteristics of students but fail to classify students accurately in terms of deep learning features.
Meanwhile, these approaches are unable to analyze these high-dimensional learning behaviors in massive amounts
of data. Hence, we propose a learning style classification approach based on the deep belief network (DBN) for
large-scale online education to identify students’ learning styles and classify them. The first step is to build a

learning style model and identify indicators of learning style based on the experiences of experts; then, relate the
indicators to the different learning styles. We improve the DBN model and identify a student's learning style by
analyzing each individual's learning style features using the improved DBN. Finally, we verify the DBN result by
conducting practical experiments on an actual educational dataset. The various learning styles are determined by
soliciting questionnaires from students based on the ILS theory by Felder and Soloman (1996) and the Readiness
for Education At a Distance Indicator. Then, we utilized those data to train our DBNLS model. The experimental
results indicate that the proposed DBNLS method has better accuracy than do the traditional approaches.

Introduction

With the deepening integration of big data [1] and edu-
cation, the learning revolution, represented by MOOCs
[2], Khan academy [3] and Flipped classroom [4], has
had a strong impact on traditional forms of education
and has highlighted the importance of large-scale online
education in reshaping education reshaping—that is,
globalized resources, modularized supply, personalized
teaching and independent study can be implemented by

restructuring and process reengineering. Large-scale on-
line education has made significant breakthroughs in
teaching environments, content presentation, teaching
modes, and learning evaluations. Large-scale online edu-
cation also innovates and revolutionizes study approaches
and is an effective way to promote educational equity and
improve teaching quality. By offering new learning situa-
tions and technologies, the unique characteristics of
MOOCs have given rise to a new learning model, person-
alized learning [5, 6]. In a MOOC environment, learners
can select and order customized courses according to
their own purposes and backgrounds. However, the mate-
rials in MOOCs are rather complicated; consequently
learners can easily become trapped in “learning Trek” and
“cognitive overload” situations [7] during the process of
receiving information. Nevertheless, MOOCs provide the

same learning materials and learning activities for all
learners and ignore individual differences because they fail
to analyze individual learning behaviors. As a result,
MOOCs cannot achieve the ability to teach students ac-
cording to their aptitudes [8]. By analyzing online learning
behaviors, we can accurately identify a user’s learning
characteristics and recommend personalized resources to
help them improve their quality of learning. At present, it
is urgent to determine how to analyze and identify the
learning features of individual users by mining big data in
adaptive learning [9, 10].

In an online learning environment, individual differ-
ences between learners are clearly evident in terms of
time, learning duration, selected learning content, online
interactions, etc. Some learners prefer to complete learn-
ing tasks during the daytime, while others prefer learn-
ing at night. Some learners participate in discussions or
group activities on discussion forums or though other
social networking applications, while others prefer quiet
study. Among all the individual characteristics, learning
style is an important factor that affects learners’ individ-
ual differences. In other words, different learners have
different tendencies in terms of learning style [11].

To date, researchers have made important contribu-
tions regarding how to apply learning styles to online
learning, especially in the field of learning style identifi-
cation and prediction [12-15]. Most of these studies
mainly collected and recorded real behavior data left by
learners during the network learning process to build a
set of learners’ network learning behaviors, and used
data mining algorithms, neural networks or simple cal-
culation rules to automatically detect learning; thus
some research results have been obtained. However, the
central problem is that these studies were not based on
large-scale online learning platforms; consequently, they
do not meet the demands of modern online learning
platforms for effective learning style detection based on
a large number of complex network learner behaviors.

Therefore, it is urgent to solve problems such as how
to identify learners’ learning styles, how to guide individ-
ual learners to construct learning objectives and plans,
and how to recommend specific learning resources that
reflect an individual’s needs and abilities. Identifying
learning styles through learners’ online behavior and
classifying them correctly plays an important role in
realizing adaptive learning. In ta MOOC environment,
the following three important problems must be solved
to accurately identify and classify learning styles:

1) What type of learning style model is suitable in
MOOC learning environments?

2) What is the relationship between learning behavior
and learning styles in MOOC learning
environments?

(2020) 9:26 Page 2 of 17

3) What classification method can be used to
overcome the problem of inaccurate classification
due to the high dimensionality of learning behavior
data in MOOC environments?

Through intensive study of the relevant literature con-
cerning learning styles, we found that the learning style
model proposed by Felder-Silverman is suitable for
MOOC online learning environments. Meanwhile, the
online learning relationship between behavior character-
istics and learning styles is complex. Through our obser-
vations, together with the results obtained from experts,
we found that differences in student behavior can be de-
scribed using the following four dimensions: information
processing, perception, input, and understanding. There-
fore, the characteristic indicators should be developed
based on these four learning behavior dimensions to
form the data mining dimension.

We propose a learning style classification based on a
DBN for MOOCs, called DBNLS. In this method, the in-
herent characteristics of learners—their learning styles—
are adopted as the classification criteria. First, we summa-
rized and analyzed individual learner differences and pref-
erences to build a learning style model suitable for
MOOC learning environments. Then, we determined
which learning-habit indicators should be used based on
expert experience and linked the indicators to learning
styles within individual sessions. The deep learning model
DBN was used to learn the high-dimensional learning
style features and model learning styles to classify students
accurately. Finally, we collected network learning behavior
data by analyzing the weblogs left during online learning
sessions on StarC [16], a MOOC platform used at Central
China Normal University. Meanwhile, we also conducted
offline empirical research and collected learning style
questionnaire data, which we used as training samples to
train the DBN model. The trained DBNLS model was ap-
plied to classify students’ learning styles. The results show
that the method proposed in this paper is superior to the
traditional methods.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

1) Learners’ intrinsic characteristics and learning styles
are introduced as an important standard for learner
classification. Simultaneously, the explicit attributes
of the network behavior are effectively mapped to
the intrinsic characteristic learning style indicators.
These network behavior indicators serve as
important DBN inputs for classifying students’
learning styles.

2) We introduce social interaction factors into the
learning style model, with the view of including the
network learning environment characteristics and
the learner interactions in the learning platform.
Zhang et al. Journal of Cloud Computing: Advances, Systems and Applications

The learning style model established in this paper
focuses not only on the static learning resources
available to students but also on how they interact
with others. For example, some students tend to
complete tasks through communication and
discussion, while others tend to think and work
independently.

3) We introduce a deep-learning algorithm into learn-
ing classification in the field of education. This ap-
proach effectively overcomes the problems of the
sharp rise in computational complexity resulting
from high-dimensional data in traditional classifica-
tion methods and data overfitting conditions.

4) The research was conducted using a practical
online learning activity. We collected and
distinguished both online and offline data. The
offline data served as training data used to train the
model, which subsequently was used to classify
students’ online learning behaviors. The results
show that the proposed mechanism is considerably
more accurate than is the traditional classification
model.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Related
work and background introduces the related works and
provides some background concerning learning styles,
the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) learning
model, and BP. We then present the learning style
model and the classification model in Learning style
model in MOOCs. We present our DBNLS algorithm
and its training model in Learning style detection based
on deep belief neural networks. The details of the ex-
perimental evaluation are described in Section 5, and
this work is concluded in Conclusions.

Related work and background
Research on learning style theory
The concept of “learning style”, first defined by Herbert
Thelen, has since evolved into dozens of learning style
theories and has been put into practice in the field of
education. With the teaching methods described in
“Teaching Students in Accordance with Their Aptitude”
and “Learner Centered”, an increasing number of
scholars have shifted their focus to the learning style of
learners, which is hoped to be fully considered in the
MOOC design process. In recent years, the rapid devel-
opment of online educational tools such as MOOCs has
inspired scholars to consider how to reflect different
learning styles in online education so that appropriate
materials and methods could be suggested accordingly
to help improve learning efficiency [11—15, 17].

Theories on learning style have become relatively ma-
ture after a long research history. Many scholars have
proposed sophisticated learning style models. According

(2020) 9:26 Page 3 of 17

to Curry’s learning style model, all learning styles can be
classified into three levels, namely, “teaching preference”
the outer level, “information processing mode” the mid-
dle level, and “cognitive style” the innermost level [18].
Learning style models of this type include Kolb [19],
Honey and Mumford [20], Dunn [21] and Felder-
Silverman’s learning style models [11]. In addition, other
models such as cognitive styles, VARK, and Keefe’s
learning style model, propose different definitions of
learning style.

Dunn’s learning style model is the representative the-
ory of the “onion model” at the outer level. Dunn was
mainly concerned about the stimuli that influence learn-
ing activities [19]. These stimuli are related to the learn-
ing environment, social environment, physiological
factors, psychological factors and emotional factors.
However, all these stimuli are highly unstable and vul-
nerable as can easily be observed. In contrast, Kolb was
interested in the learning process. He suggested that
each learning process goes through four self-related
phases. Learners exhibit different preferences towards
these phases [19]. Based on the learning models in [19,
22], and [20], Felder-Silverman provided a brand-new
learning style model [11] that focuses on learners’ indi-
vidual cognitive characteristics and provides a compre-
hensive description of learning styles by combining
information processing, information cognition, informa-
tion input and information understanding.

Felder also designed the Solomon Learning Style Scale
based on the learning style model, which provides a
good method for measuring learning styles. As a result,
Felder-Silverman’s model is not only widely used in
practice but also suitable for a web-based learning envir-
onment. Moreover, the Solomon Scale enjoys fairly good
reliability and validity and has become popular in the
educational field [23, 24]. Although scholars have pro-
vided different definitions, they all include the three
main characteristics of learning styles. First, learning
style varies among individuals, which means that differ-
ent learners tend to have different learning style prefer-
ences. Second, learning style formation is affected by
stimuli from both the outside environment and the inner
self, such as cultural discrepancies, family factors, educa-
tional factors, and physiological factors. Third, learning
style affects learning behavior. Learners with different
learning styles show differences in learning strategies
and learning habits.

Because the measurement approach biased toward es-
sential characteristics (cognitive characteristics) by Felder-
Silverman fits web learning, and Felder-Silverman’s model
has been proved through numerous experiments to have
gained a high frequency in practice, as shown in Table 1,
this paper chooses Felder-Silverman as the base learning
style model [25]. However, characteristics such as social

interactions in new learning environments, such as
MOOCs, were not considered in Felder-Silverman’s
model even though they should be considered in web
learning. Therefore, although based on the Felder-
Silverman model, this paper will expands the social inter-
action dimension to make it more suitable for a MOOC
teaching environment.

Learning style identification

The traditional questionnaire approach to measuring
learning style does not fit well in a MOOC teaching en-
vironment—primarily because factors such as the sub-
jective consciousness of the interviewees, failure to
understand questions, and learning preferences mea-
sured at a specific point would negatively affect the ac-
curacy of the results. Therefore, an increasing number of
scholars both domestically and internationally have in-
stead been studying learning styles through automatic
detection methods [26-30]. An automatic detection
method is a way to detect learners’ learning styles auto-
matically by collecting real data recorded about learners
by web learning platforms and adapting data mining,
neural networks or simple calculation rules to the set of
learning behaviors that arise in in web learning contexts
[31-35].

The University of Vienna analyzed learning platform
data and web logs formed during learning platform ses-
sions to recognize learners’ learning behaviors [31]. In
[32], the authors predicted students’ learning styles by
analyzing log data using BP neural networks, while [33]
used a Bayesian network approach to recognize learning
styles of students attending artificial intelligence online
courses and discovered a significant disparity in the ac-
curacy of predicting learning styles from different di-
mensions [34] combined decision tree and _ hidden
Markov models to evaluate learning behaviors and solve
difficulties in sequence data to more accurately analyze
of sequential and comprehensive learning styles from
the understanding dimension. A contrast test was con-
ducted in [26] on the teaching efficiency of adaptive
learning styles. The results show that the students who

(2020) 9:26 Page 4 of 17

attended adaptive courses acquired a higher learning effi-
ciency and performed better on examinations. The authors
of [28] reported that standard achievement assessments
could not only assess students’ learning abilities but also de-
tect individual learning characteristics and predict the re-
sults [29]. analyzed and processed the web pages visited by
web-based learners to study learning styles, and [30] re-
corded web-based learners’ learning demands and activities
and explored their individualized features to study learning
performance assessments.

Both the traditional learning algorithms and the back-
propagation with adaptive learning rate (BPAL) network
algorithm have two weak points. The first is that the raw
data cannot include too many properties; the greater the
number of properties are, the greater the difficulty is
when composing a corresponding vector. When execut-
ing the classification algorithm, the computational com-
plexity increases exponentially as the vector length
increases. Second, the mapping relations between the
properties of the raw data and learning styles cannot be
too complex. Thus, these algorithms are unsuitable for
complex mapping relations. The conventional methods
fail to analyze and process the complex relations be-
tween the behavior data of web learning and learning
styles. However, deep learning is a way to extract charac-
teristics from vectors in a step-by-step manner, allowing
more useful features to be studied by building a machine
learning model with multiple hidden layers and enor-
mous amounts of training data to promote the classifica-
tion and prediction accuracy.

Deep belief networks

Deep belief networks (DBNs) were first proposed by
Hinton et al. in 2006 [36]. A DBN analyzes the potential
features of texts, images and voice by constructing a
multilayer neural network model [37]. The training data
proceeds through the network layer by layer, and each
layer extracts more advanced features than the previous
layers. Deep learning has substantial advantages over
traditional neural network learning methods from two
aspects. One is that each individual layer’s training
greatly promotes the training efficiency. The other is
that they avoid the traditional neural networks’ risk of
becoming trapped in local minima under an unsuper-
vised learning environment. The DBN model can be a
combination of a multilayer RBM (unsupervised learning
network) [38], BP (a supervised classifier) [39] or other
prediction models.

As shown in Fig. 1, an RBM consists of two layers: a
visible layer (visible units) and a hidden layer (hidden
units).. The connections between neurons have the fol-
lowing characteristics: no connections within the layer
and a fully connected inner layer, where the inner layer
includes both the visible layer neurons and the hidden

layer neurons. The term fully connected refers to the
connection between every neuron in the visible and hid-
den layers. In an RBM each neuron has only two states:
0 or 1.

An RBM is an energy-based undirected generative
model. Its energy function is formulated as follows for a
given set of states (v, i):

ny Ny Ny Ah
Ea(v, h) = ) _ bivi- ) j Fi ) i=] ja Wavilty,

(1)

whose terms are described as follows:

v = (V1, V2,°"",Vp,)" : the state vector for the visible
layer, v; represents the state of the first i neuron in the
visible layer;

h = (hy, hy, °*,hy,)' : the state vector for the hidden
layer, h; represents the state of the first j neuron in the
hidden layer;

a = (1,42, “+ dy) ER™ ‘the bias vector of the visible
layer, a; indicates the bias of the i neurons in the visible
layer;

b = (by, bo, --, by, )" ER” :the bias vector of the hidden
layer, b; represents the bias of the j neurons in the visible
layer;

W = (wy)eR”*”:the weight matrix between the hid-
den layer and the visible layer. w; represents the connec-
tion weights between the i neurons in the hidden layer
and the j neurons in the visible layer.

The above shows the component form, but it can be
rewritten in matrix form:

Eo(v,h) = -b’h-a! v-Wvh. (2)

Using the energy function defined in Formula 1, the
joint probability distribution of the state (V, H) can be
given as follows:

(2020) 9:26 Page 5 of 17
1 _E,(v,h)
Po(v,h) = Zo. my (3)
where

Zo = ne (4)

which is a normalization factor, also called the parti-
tion function.
Through derivation, we obtain

Po(hy = 1| v) = sigmoid @ + yo mK) (5)

Po(vz —] | h) = sigmoid (a ++ yo wih) (6)

The sigmoid function is a commonly used activation
function in neural networks and is defined as follows:

 

sigmoid(x) = ( ves) (7)

RBM training

Given a training sample, RBM training is intended to ad-
just the parameters 0 {W, a, b} to fit the given training
sample. For this parameter, the probability distribution
of the corresponding RBM representation should fit the
training data insofar as possible. The mathematical de-
scription is as follows:

Suppose the training sample set is

S= {viv}, (8)

where n, is the number of training samples, v! = (v‘,
v5,°"*,vi,),i=1, 2, «+, 45, and the samples are independ-
ent and identically distributed. The goal when training
the RBM is to maximize the likelihood function.

Los =[[" Pv). (9)

The product [];",P(v') which addresses special prob-
lems can be derived from the strict monotonic property
of the function Inx; the maximization of Lg 5 is equiva-
lent to In Los. Therefore, the goal of training RBM is

to maximize the likelihood function.

In Los = In 12.2) = So In P(v).

For simplicity, in the following, Lg 5 is simplified to Ls.
Then, the maximum likelihood function evaluates the

Contrast divergence (CD) is a standard method for training
an RBM [40]. The steps in the k-step CD algorithm (abbrevi-
ated as CD-k) are simple. Specifically, approximately Vv € S
take an initial value of v© =v ; however, the implementation
of k-step acquisition Gibbs sampling, which constitutes the
first t steps (t = 1, 2, ---,k), is executed as follows:

Use P(h | vé-)) to sample ne-,

Use P(h | vé-)) to sample v’;

Then, through k-step Gibbs sampling, we obtain the
v formula to approximate the corresponding desired

Learning style model in MOOCs

Learning style model

The related studies show that Felder-Silverman’s learning
style is suitable for use in web-based education environ-
ments, and the Solomon questionnaire that matches it has
relatively high sophistication and popularity. From the per-
spectives of information processing, perception, input, and
understanding, the learning style model classifies the learn-
ing styles into 16 categories, which are LS = (Procession,
Perception, Input, Understanding}. Perception = {Sensitive/
Intuitive}, Input = {Visual/Verbal}, Understanding = {Se-
quential/Global}. Nevertheless, the model considers only
the interactions between learners and learning materials ra-
ther than the interactions between students as well as be-
tween students and teachers, and the latter is the defining
characteristic in MOOC learning environments.

Opinions from domain experts were adequately
considered to build a learning style model suitable for
MOOC environments. Based on the Felder-Silverman
model and considering the new features available in
online learning environments, the learning style model
used in this study adds social factors and independ-
ent/dependent/competitive types with reference to the
measurement of interpersonal factors in the Readiness
for Education at a Distance Indicator (READI) [41].

We built a learning style model suitable for MOOCs called
MOOCLS, that comprises five dimensions and is able to pro-
vide a comprehensive description of learners in net-based
learning environments. MOOCLS = (Procession, Perception,
Input, Understanding, Society}, Procession = {Active/Reflect-
ive}, Perception = {Sensitive/Intuitive}, Input = {Visual/Ver-
bal}, Understanding = {Sequential/Global}, Society = {social/
solitary}. The dimensions in the model and their perform-
ance characteristics are listed in Table 2.

fundamental education tool. StarC has made great contribu-
tions to resource sharing nationwide. Two hundred MOOC
resources were made available online from March 2015 to
August 2016, and 85,345 accounts were opened, 32,987 of
which were active. The platform provides various functions
for users to learn and communicate, such as knowledge
maps, videos, tests, wikis, instant messaging, etc. All the data
produced in the learning process are recorded in the system
and constitute a set (F) of users’ learning behavior features.
We then map these learning behaviors according to the
learning styles defined by the MOOCLS model and the expe-
riences of e-learning experts to predict which learning style
model the user belongs to based on the user’s learning be-
havior features, as is shown in the Table 3.

Active/reflective learning style and e-learning behavior
A learning style can be recognized by users’ learning be-
haviors on forums, wikis, and homework in the active/

reflective dimension. Generally, active learners tend to
have more posts, post replies and post views in the
forum, while reflective learners prefer to think in private
and tend to read posts instead of posting. This approach
can also be used to recognize active/reflective learners.
A wiki is an important feature through which teachers
can instruct students by providing key information.
When teachers make an entry, students can revise and
extend its definition, connotation and denotation, in the
course of which each change to the wiki view and all the
wiki edits are recorded. Active learners are inclined to
try more wiki functions and continually revise the entry.
In contrast, reflective learners analyze each question
carefully and look up wiki entries more than they revise
or update them. Regarding homework, data concerning
the time an assignment is submitted before the home-
work deadline and the frequency of completed home-
work problems are collected.

The users’ video play time is recorded as well as the fre-
quency of video views, K-map views, textbook views,
wiki views, wiki edits and introduction views. Verbal
learners are more inclined to read text messages such as
course book listings, course introductions, wiki edits and
views, while visual learners prefer materials such as
graphs, tables and videos. As a result, the time they
spend on video and the frequency with which they check
K-maps tend to be larger.

Sequential/global learning style and e-learning behavior
Outline views, introduction views, button clicks and
tables of contents views are collected to help deter-
mine whether the learning style is sequential or glo-
bal. Global learners normally visit comprehensive
introduction pages, such as outline views and intro-
duction views, while sequential learners visit fewer
such pages. Sequential learners prefer to click but-
tons, while global learners prefer to navigate by click-
ing catalogue links.

Social/solitary learning style and e-learning behavior

From a social interaction perspective, learners can be di-
vided into social and solitary types. These two types are
distinguishable by number of posts, forum visits, replies,
post views, post replied to, posts viewed by, self-
homework views, charts, and chart replies. Social learners
like to communicate with others, while solitary learners
prefer to study alone. Therefore, social learners tend to be
more active in discussion areas. They communicate with
others frequently by posting, replying to posts and using
built-in chat tools. They also maintain good relationships
with others through their posts, post replies and chats.
Solitary learners are much less active than their social
counterparts and more likely to focus on their own home-
work. These learners have fewer posts, post replied to,
viewed by, and fewer chat messages.

Description of the learning style test

The learning style test recognizes a learner’s learning
style based on learning behavior features. It can be for-
mulated as follows:

F>Ls

where LS € {00000, 00001, -::,11111} and the user’s
learning style belongs to one of the learning style di-
mensions. For example, a 00001 means that a user’s
learning style could be recognized by fundamental
features and properties from the following dimen-
sions: information processing as Active, information
perception as Sensitive, information input as Visual,
information understanding as Sequential, and social
interaction as Social.

Learning style detection based on deep belief
neural networks

Predicting and identifying users’ learning styles by
analyzing a large number of e-learning behaviors is a
complicated process in light of the complicated inter-
actions in learning and the high-dimensionality of the
data caused by remarkable differences. The traditional
classification approaches cannot identify users’ learn-
ing styles effectively and accurately. In this paper, the
deep learning DBN model is used to identify the
users’ learning styles. Although deep learning in other
areas has achieved great success, it has still not been
widely applied in the field of educational technology.

DBNLS model

The DBNLS (DBN for MOOCLS) model is the core
component of identifying learners’ learning styles.
DBNLS consists of a multilayer RBM and a BP network
layer: the RBM implements feature extraction and the
BP assists in fine-tuning the DBN and predicting learn-
ing styles. The core procedure can be formulated as fol-
lows. The first step is to obtain set of original learning
behavior data by collecting and pretreating network be-
havior data. After training the DBN model with the ex-
tracted set, the features and weights of the e-learning
activities are determined. Some of the learning styles are
recognized through questionnaires and set as the stand-
ard dataset. Thus, the DBN model is fine-tuned and
trained by adding the BP to fit the DBNLS to identify
the learning style model in e-learning activities. The de-
tails are shown in Fig. 2.

The steps of DBNLS are as follows:

Step 1: Data preprocessing: Eliminate logged dates
that deviate from the normal values, and normalize
the dates from the characteristic value of learning

maximum value with a single characteristic value) to

Step 2: Measure part of the active users’ learning
styles through the Index of Learning Style
Questionnaire. The scale contains 44 questions.
Each question is based on different learning style
dimensions. With four dimensions in total, each
dimension includes 11 questions, and each question
corresponds to 2 alternative answers. Learning
styles can be tested accurately using this scale. By
labeling the online learning styles with the
corresponding e-learning activity data from the
questionnaire, we finally obtained a labeled
activity set DB,,,.;. We then divide the dataset
into a training set DBy,;, and a testing set

Step 3: We used the data from DB,,,;,, to train

the DBN. BP received supervised training based on
DByain after the unsupervised DBN training.

Step 4: We used DB,,,, to test the performance and
effect of the DBNLS model.

DBNLS model training

After training the DBNLS model the DBN can extract
the behavioral characteristics of network learning behav-
iors and identify the learning styles of network learning
behavior. The process of training the DBNLS learning
style model is to adjust the parameters of each layer of
the RBM to minimize the reconstruction error of the
DBNLS model output. The model can abstract and ex-
tract the most original features of the sample data. The
RBM parameter set of each layer of the DBNLS model
W=W+n(7-AW)

a=a+y(*Aa)

b =b + n(7-Ab)
and b are the weight matrix, the bias vector of the
visible layer to the hidden layer, and the bias vector
of the hidden layer to the visible layer, respectively.
The DBNL model training is performed layer by layer,
and the output of each RBM layer is used as the

in this paper is 0 = , where W, a

input to the next layer. The gradient descent method
is used during the training of each layer of the RBM
to maximize the likelihood function of the RBM out-
put. When the gradient descent reaches a reasonable
value (or the training times reach a preset value), fea-
ture extraction is complete, and the DBMLS model
has obtained a complete representation of the training
data. At this point, the training process ends.

To perform learning style detection, a known analysis
test sequence is input as a parameter into the DBMLS
model, and the classifier output of the DBNLS model is
used as the prediction result.

According to the introduction of the DBN model,
DBN training can be simplified into several independ-
ent RBM training sessions. The feature vector data
are used as the input to fully train the first RBM;
then, we fix the weight matrices and bias of the first
RBM. The hidden layer neurons are set as the input
vector to the second RBM. After fully training the
second RBM, we stack the second RBM on top of the
first RBM. The steps above are repeated until the en-
tire training process is completed for all the RBM
models. Finally, the hidden layer neuron state of the
last RBM is set as the input to the BP neural network
to supervise it efficiently.

DBNLS training can be roughly divided into two
phases. The first phase is to initialize the model pa-
rameters, in which the given vector training sample
S(|S| =,), training cycle T, learning rate n, and k al-
gorithm in CD-k is set before specifying the unit
numbers n,, m;, of the visible and hidden layers and
initializing the vectors a, b as well as the weighting
matrix W. Then, the training process is as follows:

FOR iter = 1,2,---, T DO

1. transfer CD —k, generate AW, Aa, Ab.
2. refresh the parameters: W = W + ni AW),

To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
DBNLS training, the important parameters have been
processed. The DBN classification algorithm is the
core part of DBNLS; it determines the learning style
identification performance of the whole DBNLS. The
DBN classification algorithm is shown in Fig. 3.

Small batch data During the course of the FOR loop in
the second training step, the training sample set S is ap-
plied to generate the data AO’ (AW, Aa, Ab) one time
through superposition of the partial derivative in various
samples. By dividing set S into tens or hundreds of small
batches and calculating them individually, the training
efficiency can be improved considerably, and the advan-
tages of GPUs and MATLAB matrix multiplication can
be exploited. To address the problem that the gradient
of the parameter differs for the different capacities of
small batch data, we can divide the total gradient by the
size of the small batch data to obtain the average gradi-
ent during the parameter updating process:

Ag

In (23), B denotes the small batch data capacity. Every
small batch of data should include samples from each
class, and the samples function better when they are of
equal size. The size of B is set to multiples of the
number 10.

Learning rate The study of n plays a key role in the
process of updating neural network parameters because
its size directly affects the algorithm training perform-
ance. A large n improves the rate of convergence; how-
ever, it also can cause the algorithm to become unstable.
In contrast, a smaller n improves algorithm stability, but
slows down convergence [42]. In this paper, a momen-
tum term was added to update the parameters to pro-
mote both the convergence speed and the performance
equilibrium.

In (24), A is the momentum learning rate. The addition
of X causes parameter updating that is not totally in ac-
cord with the current sample gradient direction; instead,
it is combined with the previous parameter change
direction.

Number of hidden layer units Due to the lack of the-
oretical support, it is difficult to determine the RBM
numbers of hidden layer units in DBN. Generally, the
units can be determined according to the number of
neurons in the input and output layers. If the hidden
layer units are quite small, the ability of the RBM model
to obtain information will be too weak to sum and re-
flect the characteristics of the training set. When there
are too many hidden layer units, training will require
more time and cause overfitting problems.

We determined the number of hidden layer units
through experiments in this paper. The first step is to
set the number of hidden layer units to a smaller value
and then train on the samples. The reasonability of the
results are judged according to the number of hidden
layer units. When the training effect is poor, we can in-
crease the number of hidden layer units until the results
reach reasonable values.

The prediction of learning style

During the DBNL model training, the expressions of dif-
ferent network behavior characteristics are established.
The MOOCLS learning style model is established in the
form of parameter set 8 ={W,a,b}. When another set of
network learning behavior characteristics are input, the

trained DBNLS can quickly identify the learning style
the input network behavior characteristics belong to.

Experimental

We conducted a set of experiments to set the parame-
ters and examine the effectiveness of our proposed
DBNLS approach for identifying learning styles in terms
of accuracy and quality.

The experimental environment

StarC is a free MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)
platform open to K-12 education set up by the Central
China Normal University. It is a research exchange and
results application platform of the National Digital
Learning Project and Technology Center, and it works
to deliver free learning courses designed by first-rate
teachers in our country to provide high-quality teaching
materials for the majority of young students and to help
educators establish an effective online learning commu-
nity. Educators use the platform to design and release
online courses and online teaching evaluations. During
the process of online learning on StarC, interactive data
of network behavior, such as independent learning jour-
nals, test performances and learners’ essential informa-
tion are produced and stored.

This study is based on the curriculum reform experi-
ment carried out by Suzhou Educational Informatization
Reform. Our candidates are more than 500s year stu-
dents from 10 classes in Suzhou Junior High School and
Zhenhua Junior High School. All the students are eager
to learn. Before the online learning courses formally
started, some targeted training was delivered by the
teachers to help the students understand how to use an

learning platform to conduct independent

Data preparation

In addition to the behavior data collected by the StarC
platform, we also collected offline questionnaires. We
could associate the offline subjects’ names and student
numbers using an online learning behaviors dataset. The
questionnaires were mainly used as the class labels for
the training dataset. The learner behaviors were trained
through the DBNLS model, and finally, the classification
results were obtained and compared with the class labels
and used to assess the accuracy of the DBNLS model.

The questionnaire data

The questionnaire used in this study is divided into two
parts. In the first part, we designed the offline question-
naire of this research based on the acquisition and map-
ping of online learning behaviors, according to the Index
of Learning Styles quantization table [11], which de-
scribes a learning style model and refers to the maturity
scale of each dimension in the DBNLS model. Van Zwa-
nenberg’s research results indicate that the Index of
Learning Styles scales have good reliability and validity
[42]. The online learning styles model constructed for
this research used all the items of the Index of Learning
Styles scales to ensure both the consistency and integrity
of the scales. In addition, it adds the social interdimen-
sion—11 questions for the social dimension of learning
style. The second part of the questionnaire captures per-
sonal information. To enable the offline respondents to
adapt the online data analysis objects, this part seeks to
acquire personal information such as the testee’s real
name, student number, and StarC platform user account,
enabling one-to-one correspondence between the stu-
dents’ learning style information and their online learn-
ing behavior data.

The scoring formula for this scale has three steps. The
first step is to classify a and b answers to questions cor-
responding to each dimension in the questionnaire.
Then, the second step is to determine the total number
of answers to the questions in each dimension. Finally,
the last step is to compare the larger sum with the
smaller sum and combine the difference value with the
letter of the larger sum. The final result is added to the
last list. (The difference value means indicate the ten-
dency level of the learning style; the letter denotes

Table 4 Index of learning styles

(2020) 9:26 Page 12 of 17

different types of learning style). The design for measur-
ing the items for social contact and solitude in the social
dimension referred to learning-styles-online.com [43].
Each question adopts a three-level scale for measure-
ment, where a “O” means unmatched and a “1” means
matched. The forum of the questionnaire is shown in
the Table 4.

To explain the class label role of the questionnaire in
the DBNLS model, the measuring items in the question-
naire needed to be designed. There are 44 questions in
the questionnaire corresponding to the Index of Learn-
ing Styles and 11 questions for each dimension for a
total of 55 questions. The specific questionnaire question
content refers to [43, 44] and the Learning Style Self-
Test Questionnaire, as shown in the supplementary ma-
terial below. With the assistance of the head teacher in
the subject class and under the assumption that the
questionnaire data matched the platform data, all the
questionnaires were effective. To ensure that all the
questionnaires were repeatedly confirmed and examined,
520 questionnaires were recycled, of which 508 are valid.

According to the Table 5, the measurement result “9a”
in the information processing dimension means that the
subject belongs to the “active type” and has a strong ten-
dency level in learning style. The measuring result“5b”
in the information perception dimension means that the
subject belongs to the “conscious type” and has an aver-
age tendency level of learning style. The information in-
put and information comprehension dimensions can
also be analyzed in this way. For the social dimension, a
1 means the subject belongs to the “social level” learning
style. In summary, the measurement result is =10,101 =
21. The online learning behavior data are used to obtain
the corresponding learning style by comparing the data
trained through the DBNLS model and the question-
naire results.

Network behavior data

The data produced by the learners during the whole
learning process is stored in a MySQL database, as
Mongo data and as a journal file. The user table is used
to store students’ personal information, including birth
date, grade, gender, learner types, while the journal file
is used to record the online learning student interactive
data (the students’ personal data was hidden). As shown
in Fig. 3, this table reflect only part of the learning data

from one student. Typically, there will be hundreds of
records after a student finishes an entire course.

The processing and choice of data have a large effect
on the test learning style results; thus, these aspects are
core steps in the learning style testing process. For this
study, we preprocessed the log files and extracted the
core property information, course information, forum
information, wiki information and assignment submis-
sion information.

After communicating with four veteran teachers who
participated in the experiment for this study, we con-
firmed the five types of learning style dimensions and the
corresponding Internet learning behavior, which is shown
in Table 2. Accordingly, we collected the number of visits,
posts, readers, repliers, posts replied to and post read from
the forum aspect; the compilation of wiki entries changed,
the number of changed wiki entries and the number of
read wiki entries from the wiki aspect; the advance times
of assignment submissions, the number of exercises, the
times the assignments were performed, checking and
examining homework from the homework aspect; the
number of message sent, messages replied to and message
replies from the instant messaging aspect; the durations
and times when video was played from the video aspect;
and 24 other parameter values related to other aspects
such as the number of visits to the course outline, course
abstract, course catalog, course teaching materials,

knowledge map, the number of navigational clicks to
move to the “previous/next page” and so on. These are
considered to be core characteristic attributes.

We also obtained core personal information, such as
the learners’ names and student IDs by linking the stu-
dent ID to the userInfo table in the “school in CCNU”
database, as shown in Fig. 4.

The preprocessing of data

In this paper, the learning style data are composed of
two parts: training data and test data. The training data
are divided into 30,000 unlabeled training data and 6150
labeled training data. In total, there are more than 30,
000 records containing 32 types of learning styles. The
test data comprise more than 2050 records.

The network learning behavior data, as discussed in
the previous section, come from all the learners’ network
behavior in the 10 courses of the “normal school” plat-
form. These learners consist of two groups: 820 students
who completed the learning style questionnaire and
many other online learners who did not complete the
learning style questionnaire. Based on the student [Ds
and usernames, we associated the learning style informa-
tion with the students’ learning style questionnaires and
the unlabeled network learning behavior data. Thus, we
extracted 8200 different Internet learning behaviors.
Then, we integrated the questionnaire data into the net-
work learning behavior to form the 8200 labeled learn-
ing style data, as shown in Fig. 5, forming learning style
tags that include _type information.

To improve the quality of the data. We eliminated
some invalid learning behavior data. Then, we ran-
domly divided the 8200 labeled learning style data
into two groups at a 3:1 ratio: 6150 data items were

used as labeled training data for supervised model
training; these data are denoted as train_label. The
remaining 2050 data were used as a test datasets, de-
noted as test _label, to test the effects of the DBNLS
model. Finally, the train_label test_label datasets were
used to train test the DBNLS model.

 

Another part of the unlabeled data was collected
from unknown learning style students who had also
taken the 10 courses on the “normal school” plat-
form. There are approximately 30,000 records in this
part. An example of the form of the data is shown

data, unlabeled data did not include the last line
(the types of learning styles) because their learning
styles were unknown. We used this part of the learn-
ing style data plan for unsupervised DBNLS model
training.

DBNLS classifier evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of the DBNLS model, we
chose the ILS Standard Index of Learning Styles to col-
lect the student learning style data of students. As ex-
plained before, these students were attending specific
courses in the StarC Course Platform; thus, their online
learning style behavior data was collected. We correlated
the learning style data of each student with their online
learning behaviors to form the learning style detection
data, as shown in Table 6. We separated the data into
two parts for training and testing the DBNLS model
classifier.

Table 6 demonstrates the results of the DBNLS model.
The column is the ground truth of the learning styles of
each student, the row headers indicate the learning style
predictions by DBNLS, and the values in the table show
the instances numbers in which a student with the i
learning style was falsely predicted as the j learning style,
here 1 < =i < =32 and 1 < =j < =32:

To further evaluate the DBNLS model, we decided to
compute the classification accuracy. As is shown in the
Table 7, the accuracy scores for the procession, percep-
tion, input, understanding, and sociality dimensions were
84%, 81%, 89%, 69%, 79%, respectively as is shown in the
Table 8. TN and TP represent the true negative in-
stances and true positive instances, respectively, and n is
the total number of items in the dataset.

In addition, we also applied the BP neural network to
perform the same classification experiments as the
DBNLS model. The result show that DBNLS clearly per-
forms better than the traditional BP neural network.
Garcia P used a Bayesian network to classify four types
of learning styles; the average accuracy of DBNLS was
also better than that achieved by BP.

We found that compared to the traditional BP neural
network model, the standard deviation of the DBMS

model’s accuracy is 0.1033, which is quite stable. As is
shown in the Table 9, the standard deviation of the ac-
curacy of the BP model is 0.8019, which is relatively
large and indicates model uncertainty. Because the DBN
LS model uses unsupervised pretraining of the RBM, the
RBM is pretrained, and its weight matrix is adjusted to
near-optimum values. Therefore, the stability of DBNLS
is greater than that of the BP neural network model.

We further analyzed each data dimension and found
that the detection rate for sequential/global learning
styles reflected a significantly lower value in the under-
standing dimension. By analyzing the student logs, we
found that most students read the whole course—that is,
there was no difference among the syllabus and course
profiles in terms of the number of visits. Moreover, most
students did not skip units and read the entire unit. This
phenomenon can be observed in the results obtained for
the understanding dimension, where no global learners
were discovered.

To summarize the study results, we can conclude that
DBNLS performs better than do traditional methods for
complex learning style classifications that consider more
properties.

Conclusions

The differences between learners are determined accord-
ing to each learner’s previous knowledge of the subject
matter, their learning style, learning characteristics, pref-
erences and goals. Being able to accurately classify on-
line students through networking learning behavior
analysis could enable more effective personalized sup-
port for students seeking information and learning in an
online context. This paper proposes a learning style
identification and classification method based on a DBN,
called DBNLS. First, we built a student learning style
model for MOOCS based on the existing Felder-
Silverman model and expert experience. According to
the proposed learning style model and its implications,
we evaluated the correlations between network learning

behaviors to learning style within individual sessions;
then, we used the deep learning DBN model to learn
those learning style features and model learning styles to
classify students accurately.

We conducted several experiments on an actual edu-
cational dataset to verify the proposed method. First,
some behavioral patterns in the various learning style di-
mensions were determined by conducting an experiment
with learning content based on the ILS theory by Felder
and Soloman (1996) and Readiness for Education At a
Distance Indicator. We collected actual network learning
behavior data from a MOOC learning platform and la-
beled the collected learning style data using ILS theory
to analyze and classify them. Then, we utilized those
data to train our DBNLS model. Compared with trad-
itional classification methods (BP and BN), the proposed
method achieves good accuracy and performance. How-
ever, the accuracy of the predictions regarding the un-
derstanding learning style dimensions is not perfect.

In the future, we plan to obtain more learning behav-
iors to improve the accuracy of predictions regarding
the understanding learning style dimensions. Then, we
plan to apply the DBNLS to other personalized learning
systems, such as personalized recommender systems and
personalized learning navigation.
