High-throughput density functional perturbation theory
and machine learning predictions of infrared, piezoelectric,

and dielectric responses

Many technological applications depend on the response of materials to electric fields, but available databases of such responses
are limited. Here, we explore the infrared, piezoelectric, and dielectric properties of inorganic materials by combining high-
throughput density functional perturbation theory and machine learning approaches. We compute [-point phonons, infrared
intensities, Born-effective charges, piezoelectric, and dielectric tensors for 5015 non-metallic materials in the JARVIS-DFT database.
We find 3230 and 1943 materials with at least one far and mid-infrared mode, respectively. We identify 577 high-piezoelectric
materials, using a threshold of 0.5 C/m*. Using a threshold of 20, we find 593 potential high-dielectric materials. Importantly, we
analyze the chemistry, symmetry, dimensionality, and geometry of the materials to find features that help explain variations in our
datasets. Finally, we develop high-accuracy regression models for the highest infrared frequency and maximum Born-effective
charges, and classification models for maximum piezoelectric and average dielectric tensors to accelerate discovery.

INTRODUCTION

The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI)' has revolutionized the
development of new technologically important materials, which
historically has been a time-consuming task that was mainly
dominated by trial and error strategies. Since MGI launched in
2011'*, high-throughput computational®*? and experimen-
tal'?**"°” techniques have become a foundation for the “materials
by design” paradigm. Moreover, the synergy among multi-
disciplinary sciences, along with rapid advancements in the
electronic-structure methods, computational resources, and
experimental techniques has made the process of materials
design faster and far more efficient in some cases. As a result, the
community is gradually migrating towards systematic
computation-driven materials selection paradigms7'%'?"!?78-%,
where functional materials are screened by establishing a direct
link between the macroscopic functionality and the atomic-scale
nature of the material. We are in a data-rich, modeling-driven era
where trial and error approaches are gradually being replaced by
rational strategies”°° °°, which couple predictions not only from
specific electronic-structure calculations of a given property but
also by learning from the existing data using machine learning.
Subsequent targeted experimental synthesis and _ validation
provide a means of rapid iteration to verify and improve
computational models.

Applications of these computational techniques in a high-
throughput manner have led to several databases of computed
geometries and many physicochemical properties, AFLOW’,
Materials-project®, Knhazana'’, Open Quantum Materials Database
(OQMD)°, NOMAD’, Computational Materials Repository (CMR)*”,
NIMS databases*’, and our NIST-JARVIS databases®®*!~7941~47,
Despite a few systematic experimental databases of IR data (such
as https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/vib-ser/), a systematic
investigation of IR for inorganic materials is still lacking. Similarly,

there have been only a few systematic databases developed for
piezoelectric (PZ) and dielectric (DL) materials such as by De Jong
et al.*®, Petousis et al.*?°°, Roy et al.°', and Choudhary et al.*'. In
this work, we significantly expand the scope of these previous
efforts by developing systematic databases for infrared (IR)
absorption spectra, piezoelectric tensors, and dielectric tensors.

Vibrational spectroscopy based on infrared (IR), Raman, and
neutron scattering are ubiquitous methods to probe the chemical
bonding, and thus the electronic structure of a material. Infrared
frequencies are classified in three categories: far (30-400 cm_'),
mid (400-4000 cm~'), and near (4000-14,000 cm~') IR frequen-
cies. Traditionally, IR spectroscopy was only used to probe organic
materials, but with the availability of instruments capable to
detect frequencies 600cm~', IR spectroscopy has also been
proven successful in distinguishing phases of inorganic com-
pounds>*“, thermal imaging?’, infrared astronomy”°®, and food
quality control’.

The piezoelectric tensor (PZ)°® describes the change in the
polarization of a material due to mechanical stress or strain, or
conversely, the change in stress or strain due to an external
electric field. Similarly, the dielectric tensor?”°° describes the
change in polarization due to an electric field. A related quantity,
the Born-effective charge (BEC) tensor, describes first-order
response of the atomic positions to an electric field. All of the
PZ tensor-components are zero for materials that have inversion
symmetry, leaving 138 space groups with non-zero PZ response
while DL tensors and BEC tensors can have non-zero components
regardless of symmetry. However, even when non-zero values are
allowed, symmetry still strongly restricts the structure of these
tensors.

While IR data can be used in infrared-detector design, the
associated PZ°', DL°’, and Born-effective charge data can be utilized
for designing sensors, actuators, and capacitors°?*. In addition,

there is a significant interest in finding lead-free piezoelectric
materials to replace lead zirconate titanate (PZT) in various
applications. All the above quantities can be obtained from density
functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations°?~®”. The DFPT is a
well-known technique to effectively calculate the second derivative
of the total energy with respect to atomic displacement. The
computational phonon-spectroscopy method has been recently
shown to be an effective means for characterizing materials, as
discussed by Skelton et al.”? and Kendrick and Burnett’'. The
information obtained using the DFPT method can also be utilized for
predicting piezoelectric coefficients, static dielectric matrix, and
Born-effective charges, as described by Gonze®® and Wu et al.°°.

To validate our calculations, we compare them to the handful of
available experimental data and show the uncertainty in predic-
tions. We also identify materials that we predict have exceptional
IR, PZ, or DL properties, which may be good candidates for
experimental synthesis and characterization. Finally, we develop
high accuracy supervised machine learning models based on the
classification and regression methods to pre-screen high-perfor-
mance materials without performing additional first-principles
calculations. This work is a continuation of our previous datasets
for exfoliability®, elastic**, optoelectronic*', topological?"??, solar-
cell efficiency*', and thermoelectric** property, scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy image® datasets. The complete datasets for IR, PZ,
BEC, and DL properties are provided on the JARVIS-DFT website
(https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JVASP.html). The JARVIS-DFT is
a part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) at NIST.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We use DFPT to predict the infrared, dielectric, and piezoelectric
response of insulating materials. Out of 38,000 3D materials in the
JARVIS-DFT database, we select materials with OptB88vdW
bandgaps >0.1 eV*' and energy above convex hull <0.5 eV/atom’?
and in their corresponding conventional cell representation. This
leads to 10,305 materials. Note that the OptB88vdW gaps are
generally underestimated compared to experiments but are useful
in pre-screening. The convex hull helps enumerate the thermo-
dynamic stability at OK. We further narrow down the list of
candidates with the number of atoms in the simulation cell <20
atoms leading to 7230 systems. We have completed calculations
for 5015 materials so far and other calculations are still ongoing.
After the DFPT calculations, we obtain the phonon-frequencies at
[-point as well. We predict infrared, piezoelectric, and dielectric
properties of systems only with all positive phonon-frequencies
because the materials with negative frequencies are dynamically
unstable. Dynamically unstable materials are usually the high
symmetry structure of a material that undergoes a symmetry-
lowering structural phase transition at low temperatures, such as a
ferroelectric transition, but further calculations are necessary to
understand these behaviors. For the dynamically stable materials,
we also train machine learning models to quickly pre-screen
materials for the next set of DFPT calculations. Such machine-
learning models have not been reported before to the best of our
knowledge. A brief- flow-chart of the whole process is given in
Fig. 1. Now we discuss in detail individual components of this
work below.

Infrared intensity

As mentioned above, the infrared intensity is important for
thermal-imaging, infrared-astronomy, and food-quality control.
Using Eqs. (1)-(7) (see “Methods” section), we calculate the IR
intensities of 3411 materials with bandgap >0.1 eV and positive
phonon frequencies at [-point. We compare nine experimental
(Exp.) IR modes with the DFPT results to estimate the data-
uncertainty. The comparison is listed in supporting information
(see Supplementary Table S1). Based on the data _ in

methods. ML models can be considered as a screening-tool for the
DFT calculations.

Supplementary Table S1, the difference in IR mode location
between our calculations and experiments has a mean absolute
deviation of 8.36 cm‘. This difference is small compared to the
total range of IR frequencies, from 0 to 1000cm~'. Several
previous studies also report the difference between DFPT
computed frequencies and measured peaks in this range’*~”®. In
addition to intrinsic limitations in the DFT-exchange-correlation
function, this small discrepancy may be caused by the fact that
our calculations are carried out at OK while experiments are
typically done at 300K, or that experimental systems can contain
defects and impurities, which are absent in our calculations. Given
the strong agreement between theory and experiment, we expect
that our carefully curated database will be useful for materials
characterization.

To analyze the overall trend in the IR data, we plot the results
for all materials together in Fig. 2. We observe that most of
the modes are less than 1500 cm! which is consistent with the
fact that inorganic materials generally have much lower IR
frequencies than organic and soft materials, which typically
contain covalently bonded light elements, leading to higher
vibrational frequencies. Moreover, a close look at the dataset
suggests that 3230 materials have at least one far-IR mode, and
1943 materials have at least one mid-IR mode. As expected, we
could not find any material with near-IR modes, as the largest
frequency we find is 3764.cm_ | for Mgs(HO3)2 VASP-13093). We
find 41 elemental systems such as crystalline nitrogen (JVASP-
25051), krypton (JVASP-907), xenon (JVASP-25276), etc. have no IR
peaks. This can be attributed to the acoustic sum rule for Born-
effective charges, which forces the total Born-effective charge of a
system to add up to zero. From the dataset, we also observe that
1426 materials have only far-IR, 1804 both far and mid-IR, and 139
mid-IR peaks. Some of the materials with the lowest IR frequencies
are from the halide family, such as CuBr (JVASP-5176), Agl (JVASP-
12023), TlTe3Pt2 (JVASP-4627), while some of the highest
frequencies are obtained for O- or OH-containing compounds,
such as Mgs;(HO3)2 (JVASP-13093). All the materials above
2078cm~' contain hydrogen and the next highest set of
frequencies are obtained for compounds with C-N bonds, which
is reasonable, as w~m '* (where w is frequency and m is the
atomic mass). These trends may be useful as a starting point in
identifying new materials for infrared-related devices, like
detectors, sensors, and lenses.

Next, we compare the DFPT and finite-displacement method
(FDM) phonon frequencies (obtained from our elastic-constant
database**) for 2926 materials and 72,624 phonon modes (as

shown in Fig. 2b). We find that the DFPT and FDM compare very
well (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.99), and _ significant
differences are only found for a few molecular systems such as
crystalline Hz, Nz, and a few lanthanide oxides (such as ErBiO,
JVASP-49979). This consistency suggests an overall high quality of
our computational dataset.

In Fig. 2c, we analyze the space-group variation of materials
with at least one far-IR (blue) and mid-IR (green) peaks. Some of
the high-symmetry space-groups with a high number of materials
with far-IR peaks are 36, 80, 129, 166, and 216. As shown in Venn
diagram in Fig. 2d, we find that a large number of materials with
far-IR peaks are chalcogenides (O, S, Se, Te-based compounds);
however, our database of inorganic materials is generally biased
towards oxides (39% are chalcogenides, 14% are halogens, 19%
pnictides, and 28% others), and we find many examples of halides
and pnictides with far-IR peaks as well. Halides such as MgF3, LiF,
etc. have been used in several astronomical telescopes such as
Hubble telescope’® for infrared astronomy, and non-oxide
chalcogenides such as CdTe have been used for infrared night
vision cameras. We find that denser materials generally have lower
phonon frequencies, which can be observed in Fig. 2e. This can be
explained by the fact that the denser materials have heavier
atoms leading to lower phonon frequencies for fixed spring
constants. Conversely, high IR modes seem to require low-density
materials. Finally, we analyzed how the dimensionality*’ of
materials affect the far-IR peaks (Fig. 2f). While we find that most
of the far-IR-peak materials have 3D bonding, we also determine
that a significant fraction (20.9%) are low-dimensional, which is

slightly higher than their overall representation in the database of
17.2%. The low-dimensional/vdW-bonding is determined based
on the bond-topology or lattice constant criteria’. Several
examples of materials with different dimensionality with low
and high-IR modes are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The complete list
is provided in the Supplementary Information (see “Data
availability” section). Identifying low dimensional dielectric mate-
rials is important for designing ultrathin flexible electronic devices.

Piezoelectric properties

The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process where materials
exhibit electrical polarization resulting from an applied mechanical
stress, or conversely, a strain due to an applied electric field.
Common applications for piezoelectricity include medical applica-
tions, energy harvesting devices, actuators, sensors, motors,
atomic force microscopes, and high voltage power generation”®.
As discussed in the “Methods” section, PZ responses can be
measured under constant strain, giving the piezoelectric stress
tensor ej or constant stress, giving the piezoelectric strain tensor
dj. In Supplementary Table S2, we compare DFT computed PZ
stress tensors (maximum e;) to experimental ones for several
classes of materials, such as oxides, nitrides, and sulfides, and in
several crystal structures. We find that the mean absolute
deviation in max (e;) is 0.79 C/m*, which is reasonable at least
for initial screening purposes. The relaxed-ion contribution to the
piezoelectric tensor is proportional to the inverse dynamical
matrix (see Eq. (5) in the “Methods” section), which makes this
contribution very sensitive to low-frequency IR modes. These

modes are often very sensitive to temperature changes and
defects, especially in ferroelectric materials, which makes a direct
comparison between theory and experiment challenging’’. In
Fig. 3a, we show a histogram of the distribution of the maximum

npj Computational Materials (2020) 64

absolute value of the ej; PZ tensor component across the dataset,
which shows a peak at zero and a long-tailed distribution. Most of
the materials have max ej less than 1.0, but some of the high PZ
materials have max. e; above 4C/m*. We choose a 0.5 C/m?
threshold to select whether a material is a good PZ material,
giving rise to 577 screened materials. The 0.5 C/m* threshold value
is used in Fig. 3d-f. In Fig. 3b, we plot a similar histogram for the
maximum component of the dj tensor, the more commonly
measured piezoelectric coefficient. The value of d33 is generally
below 50x10 '7C/N as shown in Fig. 3b. Examples of the
predicted lead-free high PZ materials, which we do not find
reported in literature are MoO3 (JVASP-30103), YWN3(JVASP-
38813), W(BrO), (JVASP-30364), InBiO3(JVASP-34653), NbNO
(JVASP-52492), MgTiSiO; (JVASP-9481), MgCN,z (JVASP-7814),
CazSnS, (JVASP-40157), ZnTa,0, (JVASP-9231), and Bi3TaO7
(JVASP-13350). The highest PZ values naturally require a
combination of high-Born-effective charges and low-frequency
IR modes, in combination with a crystal symmetry that allows for
the non-zero piezoelectric response. This confluence of factors
makes strong piezoelectricity difficult to predict and optimize.

As depicted in Fig. 3c we compare the stress and strain-based
PZ. We find that there is no obvious relation between the stress
and strain PZ tensors, implying that accurate compliance tensor is
essential to predict the dj values. It is important to note that PZ
strain tensors are the components which are generally measured
during the experiments. Next, in Fig. 3d we analyze the chemistry
of high PZ materials (using 0.5 C/m? as a threshold). Like the IR
data, the high PZ materials are dominated by chalcogenides, with
very few halides. We find most of the materials with high PZ are
3D, with low-dimensional materials under-represented. Some
examples of 3D and low-dimensional materials are given in Table
3. Analyzing the crystal systems of the high-PZ materials, we
observe that orthorhombic systems are the most represented
crystal system (Fig. 3e), while space group 216 is the most
common space group. As the PZ is a tensor quantity, we analyze
the tensor component distribution for the whole dataset in Fig. 4a,
b. All the piezoelectric tensor components have similar distribu-
tions with outlier materials with high coefficients. The e33
component has the largest number of high-value piezoelectric
response materials. This stands in contrast to other tensors, like
the elastic tensor, where diagonal components tend to dominate,
and many components are almost always near zero. Our database
can also be used to identify unusual piezoelectric mechanisms,
such as negative piezoelectricity’®, but such detailed analysis is
beyond the scope of current work.

Dielectric properties

Dielectric materials are important components in many electronic
devices such as capacitors, field-effect transistors computer
memory (DRAM), sensors and communication circuits°”°°. Both
high and low-value DL materials have applications in different
technologies. To evaluate the uncertainty in the data, we
compare the dielectric constant of 16 materials with respect to
experiments and the linear optics methods. The comparison is
listed in Supplementary Table S3. We find the DFPT total DL has a
mean-absolute deviation (MAD) of 2.46, which is lower than
MAD of 2.78 for linear optics-based Tran-Blaha modified
Becke—Johnson (MBJ) potential with respect to experiments.
Next, we analyze the dielectric constant data obtained using the
DFPT method. In Fig. 5a, we plot the distribution of the average of
the diagonal values of the dielectric tensor (Ey,). We find a peak
value of 8.9 and a long tail towards high values. Setting our
threshold for high dielectric constant materials at 20, we identify
441 materials. Some examples of previously unreported low- Eayg
materials are CCIN(JVASP-14343), GeF,4(JVASP-22445) and Mg
(CN) SVASP-29285), BClz (JVASP-164), PHF, (JVASP-25550) while
high-k materials are ZnAgF3 (JVASP-7792), CaZrNz (JVASP-79475),

36962), NbBi307 (JVASP-13286), and RuC (JVASP-36402). In Fig.
5b, we compare the dielectric constants from this work to the
low-frequency limit of the linear optics method we used to
calculate the frequency-dependent dielectric function in our
previous work*'. The electronic part of the DFPT dielectric
constant is in close agreement with that obtained from the
linear optics method. Importantly, the ionic contribution to the
static dielectric constant is frequently larger than the electronic
contribution. Our dataset of electronic and ionic components can
guide experimentalists to choose a material with either high and/
or low ionic-contribution compounds. As expected, the electronic
part of the dielectric constant and the bandgaps have a
qualitative inverse relationship’’, as shown in Fig. 5c. This
relationship, combined with the underestimation of bandgaps
by semilocal DFT functionals, can lead to an overestimation of
electronic dielectric constants. Electronic bandgap properties are
already discussed in detail in our previous work*'. The dataset
suggests that most of the high €,,, materials are 3D, with again a
high number of chalcogenides (Fig. 5d). However, the low-

dimensional dielectric materials could be of great technological
importance, because the capacitance of a layer is generally
inversely proportional to its thickness, potentially allowing for
ultrathin vdW-bonded devices. Examples of 3D/2D/1D/0D bulk
dimensional materials with a high and low-dielectric constant are
shown in Tables 4 and 5. We find similar crystal system trends for
high DL and PZ materials. In Fig. 5e, f, we show the crystal system
and dimensionality trends of the screened materials. We observe
that trigonal and tetragonal crystal systems are highly favored for
the high DL materials. Similar to the PZ data, most of the high PZ
value materials in our database are 3D. The electronic part of the
dielectric constant can be directly used to estimate other physical
properties such as the refractive index and the birefringence,
which will be analyzed in detail in a follow-up work in the future.

Dynamically unstable materials

Our analysis finds many materials with imaginary phonon
frequencies at [-point, which we call dynamically unstable
materials, and which we exclude from our main analysis. In order

to be observed experimentally, these materials must be stabilized
by finite temperature contributions to the free energy, which are
neglected in this analysis. Unstable phonon modes typically
indicate that materials will go through phase transitions, and are
therefore of interest for applications as ferroelectrics, antiferro-
electrics, ferroelastics, etc. We find 1061 materials with at least one
imaginary phonon frequency at [-point. We observed that most
unstable materials have high crystal symmetry, and would likely
go through symmetry-lowering phase transitions. Many of these

scope of this work, but may be the topic of future work. A list of
dynamically unstable materials is given in the Supplementary
Information (see “Data availability” section).

Born-effective charge analysis

In Figs. 6 and 7, we show some of the general trends in the PZ, IR,
and dielectric data. The relaxed ion contributions to all the
properties considered in this work depend on the Born-effective
charges, making understanding trends in the BEC important to
understanding the entire dataset. In Fig. 6a the overall distribution
of the maximum BEC in a material and in Fig. 6b the absolute
difference in maximum BEC and the maximum formal charges®’ in

charges, there are significant outliers with anomalous BEC, which

piezoelectric and dielectrics and is commonly associated with
ferroelectrics. For example, Fig. 6c, d portrays the maximum BEC
charge of a material and the minimum frequency versus the
piezoelectric and ionic dielectric constant, and it is evident that
almost all the high-response materials have high BEC and low-
frequency modes at [-point. We note that while anomalous BECs
are often a signature of ferroelectric materials, we remove
materials with unstable phonon modes at F in this work.

Chemical trends

Next, we depict the trends across the periodic table of the
properties investigated in this work in Fig. 7. In order to
understand the contribution of various elements to a given
property, we weigh an element in a material one or zero
depending on whether the material has a maximum-IR for far-IR
peak (Fig. 7a), has PZ value greater than 0.5 C/m? (Fig. 7b), has

dielectric constant more than 10 (Fig. 7c), and has BEC more than
5 or not (Fig. 7d). After such weighing for all the materials in our
dataset, we calculate the probability that an element is part of a
high-value material using the threshold defined above. For
example, suppose there are x number of Se-containing materials
and y of them have a property over the threshold, then the
percentage probability (p) for Se is calculated as p =<x 100%.
We find that high-IR peaks generally have the light elements H, B,
C, N, or O, as discussed earlier. The highest PZ, DL, and BEC most
commonly have Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, or Bi. The first five elements are

npj Computational Materials (2020) 64

commonly found in 4+ and 5+ oxidation states in insulators,
which tends to result in high BECs, and these elements are also
present in many ferroelectric perovskite oxides. Most of the
transition metals after d° have low IR/PZ/DL and BEC values that
can be related to the partial-filling of d-orbitals. Similar behavior
for other materials properties such as elastic properties has been
observed?*. Somewhat surprisingly, our database shows the Bi has
a higher average piezoelectric response than neighboring lone-
pair element Pb, which is commonly associated with a high-
piezoelectric response, especially in PZT, suggesting that Bi may
be effective as a Pb-free piezoelectric substitute.

Machine learning

Recent advances in data infrastructure, statistics, machine learn-
ing, and computational methods have led to an explosion of
computed data in the field of materials science*”?°*?*°. Here, we
apply the machine learning classification model using classical
force-field inspired descriptors (CFID)*°, gradient-boosting deci-
sion trees (GBDT)°®”°® to our dataset consisting of 3954
dynamically stable materials. We partition the complete dataset
of highest IR frequency, highest Born-effective charge in a system,
highest PZ tensor value, and average dielectric tensor in 90-10%
train-test divisions. To obtain optimized parameters (number of
trees, number of leaves, and learning rate) for each model, we
carry out hyper-parameter optimization with 5-fold cross-valida-
tion on the 90% training data for each model. First, we train a
regression model for predicting the highest IR frequency mode of
a material. The mean absolute error (MAE) and /* on the 10% held
set for such a model are 67.8 cm ' and 0.96, respectively. A scatter
plot of the performance on the held set is shown in Fig. 8a. While
the MAE of the ML model of 67.8cm~' is about 8 times higher
than the MAE of DFPT with respect to experiments, it is small with
respect to the whole range of investigated values. The high
value and obvious trend in Fig. 8a shows that the maximum IR
frequency can be at least roughly predicted using M. Furthermore,
a 5-fold cross-validation shows a MAE score of 77.84 + 34.67 cm |
supports such a conclusion. The corresponding learning curve
(Supplementary Fig. $1) shows that the model error decreases as
we add more data, suggesting that this model will improve as our
database increased.

GBDT inherently allows accessing the importance of all the
features of the models. For this model, feature importance analysis
shows that some of the most important descriptors are radial
distribution function data, especially at 1.5 and 5.9A, electron
affinity, and atomic radii of elements. The high importance of
short bond-lengths can be easily understood as it indicates the
presence of H-containing compounds, which tend to have high IR
modes as discussed earlier.

Similarly, we train a regression model for maximum BEC in
materials. Predicting for the test dataset, we find the MAE and r’ in
BEC as 0.6 and 0.76, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8c, showing that
a significant portion of the BEC can be predicted using ML. A 5-
fold cross-validation shows MAE of 0.69 + 0.31, therefore support-
ing the above conclusion. Given the non-trivial relationship
between the BEC and the formal charge, shown in Fig. 8b, it
may be difficult to improve this model. Some of the most
important features are the radial distribution function at 3.4A,
6.2 A, angle distribution at 143°, dihedral angle at 95°, atomic radii,
and heat of fusion of elements. We notice that the standard
deviation for cross-validation in both the above two regression
models is about half of the actual MAE values (IR: 34.67 vs
77.84 cm~' and BEC: 0.31 vs 0.69). We provide the learning curves
for these regression models in supporting information (see
Supplementary Fig. $1). Again, it shows that the models would
improve if we add more training data.

We try similar regression models for a maximum value of the PZ
tensor (MAE: 0.47 C/m?) and average DL tensor (MAE: 4.91), but

these regression models perform poorly, with 7<0.2 in both
cases. Therefore, we train classification models for predicting the
high PZ and high dielectric models using a threshold of 1 C/m? for
PZ and 10 for the dielectric constant, instead of trying to predict
exact values, as for IR and BEC. In classification models, the
accuracies are evaluated in terms of the area under curve (AUC) of
the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (Fig. 8b, d). The
ROC curve illustrates the model’s ability to differentiate between
high and low-performance materials. We find ROC AUCs of 0.86
and 0.93 for the high PZ and high DL materials. For each property,
the 5-fold cross-validation result is shown with the gray region
around the ROC curve. We find a very small deviation due to the
swapping of datasets during cross-validation, indicating the model
is fairly agnostic to the choice of test data. For the above models,
in addition to the structural descriptors, chemical descriptors such
as heat of fusion and maximum oxidation states of constituent
elements are important. We note that the structural features are
more important for the above DFPT-based properties than
quantities such as formation, exfoliation energies, bandgaps
where chemical descriptors were more important as shown in
our previous work*®. This highlights the higher difficulty in
predicting the DFPT-based properties studied in this work, as
these properties depend strongly on the structure of the material,
rather than mostly on just the type of elements and bonding.
All these models, along with the data, are publicly available at
https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/jarvisml/ to predict the performance of
new compounds. These ML models can be used to identify
materials worth performing the next set of DFPT calculations. For
instance, we apply the classification models for high DL values on
1,193,972 materials taken from AFLOW’, Materials-project®, Open
Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)°, Crystallography Open
Database (COD)®”, and JARVIS-DFT databases combined. We convert

Published in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

the structures from these databases into CFID and then we can
easily apply the trained models. As the predictions in ML are very
fast, we quickly pre-screen 32,188 high DL materials. Now, these
new materials can be prioritized in the next set of DFT calculations
in our database workflow. We have applied such workflows
previously for various quantities such as exfoliation energies, solar-
cell efficiency, and thermoelectric with appreciable success.

In summary, we perform a multi-step high-throughput compu-
tational screening study for infrared, piezoelectric, and dielectric
materials, using DFPT on 5015 inorganic materials. These data
constitute one of the largest datasets of infrared, dielectric, and
piezoelectric properties. Creating such a repository is a necessary
step for data-driven material-design. We verify our workflow by
comparing our computational results with several experimental
measurements and alternative computational techniques like
finite-differences, finding strong agreement. Using this database,
we analyze the trends in these properties in terms of the
dimensionality of materials (0D/1D/2D/3D), space-group, and
chemical constituents, and we find various correlations that
quantitively confirm and match some known chemical and
physical trends and may help designing improved materials. We
have identified several candidate compounds for high-performing
infrared-detectors, piezoelectrics, and dielectrics that have not
been studied experimentally yet, to the best of our knowledge. To
summarize, some of them are listed in Tables 1-5. We observe that
many hydroxides and halides have high and low-IR modes,
respectively, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, which are trends that can
be used for the rational design of IR-detectors. We identify several
candidates with high piezoelectric stress and strain coefficients,
and notice that they are generally oxides and belong to
orthorhombic crystal system. Somewhat surprisingly, we note
that PZ-stress and PZ-strain coefficients are not strongly

correlated. We verify the inverse relationship between bandgap
and dielectric constants at a large scale and predict several new
materials with unusually low and high constants (shown in Fig. 5c).
We find that most of the halides have low while oxides have high

dielectric constants. Using the phonon data at [-point, we identify
many dynamically unstable materials, which may include new
functional materials like ferroelectrics. Most of the high piezo-
electric, dielectric, and Born-effective charge materials contain

npj Computational Materials (2020) 64 Published in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
elements such as Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, and Bi. Most of the high-
performance materials in the above classes are three-dimensional
(i.e, no vdW bonding) in nature, but there are also several
candidates of 2D, 1D, and OD materials that can be useful for
flexible and unique electronics applications. In addition to finding
trends and correlations, we use our data to train machine learning
surrogate models to expedite the computational screening
processes. We achieve high accuracy models for predicting
Born-effective charges, maximum IR mode, and classifying high
piezoelectric and dielectric materials. We find bond-lengths,
electron-affinity, and atomic radii as some of the most important
features in the machine learning models which are also intuitive
and helpful for physical understanding. We believe that our
results, workflow, and tools can act as a guide for the experimental
synthesis and characterization of various next-generation
materials.

METHODS
Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations

The DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab-initio simulation
package (VASP)?”?'. The entire study was managed, monitored, and
analyzed using the modular workflow, which we have made available on
our GitHub page (https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis). Please note that
commercial software is identified to specify procedures. Such identification
does not imply recommendation by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. We use the projected augmented wave method?””* and
OptB88vdW functional™*, which gives accurate lattice parameters for both
and non-vdW (3D-bulk) solids®7>. In this work, a material is defined as low-
dimensional if it contains vdW-bonding in one (2D-bulk), two (1D-bulk), or
three (OD-bulk) crystallographic directions**. Both the internal atomic
positions and the lattice constants are allowed to relax until the maximal
residual Hellmann-Feynman forces on atoms are smaller than 0.001 eV
A~'. The k-point mesh and plane-wave cut-off were converged for each
materials using the automated procedure in the JARVIS-DFT’”. We assume
that achieving absolute convergence in energy is sufficient for obtaining
reasonable DFPT results, and this assumption is supported by the
agreement between frozen-phonon/finite-difference/finite-displacement
method and DFPT as well as linear-optics and DFPT results (discussed
later). We also carry out K-point convergence for three materials: Si, AIN,
MgF, as test cases to show that our converged K-points are sufficient to
predict the DFPT related data as shown in Supplementary Table $4. We
carry out the DFPT calculation on the standard conventional cell for each

The dielectric constant can be derived from the dielectric susceptibility
using:

Eap = €o(Sap + Xap) (7)

In Eqs. (4) and (5), the first term represents the electronic contribution
and the second term the ionic contribution for DL and PZ constants,
respectively.

The PZ is a 3 X 6 tensor, the DL 3 x 3, and the BEC N x 3 x 3 tensor. The IR
intensity of phonon modes is calculated using:

f(n)=S_

a

S ° Zap(s)ep(s, 1)
sB

where e,(s, n) is the normalized vibrational eigenvector of the nth phonon
mode of the sth atom in the unit cell, and a, B are the cartesian
coordinates. Z,a(s) is the Born-effective charge tensor of sth atom (here we
explicitly write both the cartesian indices of Z). These approaches are
universal and have been already applied to various material classes. More
details about the DFPT formalism can be found in elsewhere®”®°.

Machine learning training

Our machine-learning models were trained using GBDT®”*® and CFID*°
using a 5-fold cross-validation grid search on the 90% training set. Using
the best model found during the grid search, we test the model on the
10% held set and report the performance. The accuracy of the regression
models and classification models were evaluated using MAE and ROC
curves, respectively. The principal idea behind the GBDT algorithm is to
build new base learners to be maximally correlated with the negative
gradient of the loss function associated with the whole ensemble. The
CFID approach gives a unique representation of a material using
structural (such as radial, angle, and dihedral distributions), chemical,
and charge properties for a total of 1557 descriptors. We trained
machine learning regression models to predict the highest IR frequency
and maximum BEC of a material and classification models to predict
whether a material has high PZ coefficient (>0.5C/m*) and dielectric
constant (>20).
