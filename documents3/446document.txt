brain’s performance indirectly. Electrocardiogram (ECG* ~1z..al displays the variation of
cardiac dynamism that has been analyzed in this wo.': to extract the psychological
competence of the young students. A cardiac state-1 idu. ing prototype and MATLAB based
graphical-user interface (GUI) have been developed imyp'emented, and vindicated for cardiac
data acquisition and processing respectively. Co.nt rehensive investigations on linear, non-
linear, statistical, and time-frequency ana’ ys.s 0, cardiac signal as well as on their parameters

sharp peaks at brainstorming state iu hr2e-dimensional spectrogram plot, and the dominance
of sympathetic nervous system (~ NS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity for
balancing autonomic nervou. system (ANS) in parameters like standard deviation of NN
intervals, stress index, po've., and index of centralization are the key factors have been
anatomized for a fina, a, >7u1sal. The trustworthiness of the ascertaining approach has been
validated by further ane! sis of the GUI’s report and the evaluated individuals’ scores in the

mathematical test.

1. Introduction
The complex human body is a subject for numerous physical, psychological, and
hormonal activities. Synaptic transmission, cardiac rhythms, muscular activities, metabolism,

blood circulation, renal function are some of the major functions controlling the human body
for performing daily activities. In literature [1], cerebellum functions have been correlated to
cardiac rhythms as a combined effort to illustrating premeditated human physical activity.
The autonomic nervous system (ANS), a subdivision of the peripheral nervous system,
influences internal bodily functions such as cardiac rate, motor control, respiratory rate, and
so on when human body performs numerous activities for instances health care, mental
belongings, physical engagements, and especially psychological work.

ANS further subdivided into two parts, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which gets changed to the activities of the human body,
and becomes predominant alternatively depending on the type of work human performs. A
clear variation in cardiac rate has been found when a perso *ncounters a change in the
working environment. ECG is the most sensitive huma.’ bc dy parameter to evaluate
psychological working competence because heart’s rhythn ci ntinuously responds to all the
changes in human activities. Current trends in wireless ca.diac state monitoring systems with
accurate and authentic analysis have produced an innu’2cve and versatile approach for ECG
analysis.

In many pieces of literature, IoT based E’*‘G monitoring system [2] got implemented to
monitor patient’s health remotely whei. F/G monitor lacks adequate application of noise
elimination techniques and proper dicsnosis of obtained signals. ECG signal has become an
inevitable tool for biomedical analy .1s , ertaining to human bodies’ response to change in the
environment. Use of time-fregien.y analysis in terms of continuous wavelet transform
(CWT) and Short-time Fourie: ‘ransform (STFT) for ECG signals have been noticed in [3] to
determine arrhythmia in heert rue using a single lead signal. ECG signal was also exploited
to investigate mental stite .nd physiology in the ship bridge simulator control room [4]
where, heart rate variabil y (HRV) and electro-dermal activities noticed to play a vital role in
changing mental states. Assessment of mental stress based on ECG signals is the key findings
in [5], where, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique was used to extract information
considering high frequency and low-frequency portion of the ECG signal. Human stress was
determined, analyzed, and classified in [6-8] using short time ECG signals as key resources
of data analyses. Signal processing and data analysis techniques involved in the early
discussed literatures are the key motivation providing succor to the determination of
psychological competence from ECG signals.

This dissertation drapes with a brief discussion on the development of Cardiac state-
inducing prototype at first, then the design of graphical-user interface (GUI) on the
MATLAB platform to segregate, parameterize, and analyze ECG signal will be discussed in
details, and at the end, parameterized features describing diverse physical, hormonal, and
psychological activities on the human body will be taken into account in order to ascertain
the psychological competence of the subjects. Performance of the subjects while appearing
on the skill-based mathematical test will be further vindicated in the light of the features
found in ECG signal analysis and their performance on the table.

This paper has been organized in four sections where materials and methods used to define
different aspects of this literatures are depicted at first, then in the second section, results
depicting pre-processing stages of cardiac signal and extraction of features pertaining to
defining psychological activities of individuals are formulated and obtained. In the third
section, comprehensive discussion based on both extracted psychological features and
aftermath of mathematical test is made to validate the resul of ‘he work. The fifth section

draws an overall conclusion of the work.

2. Materials and methods
Working procedures, materials, and method, 3 iweorporated in this work are organized in
four sections: 1) Design of Cardiac state-ind. cing prototype, 2) Data acquisition, 3) Design

of GUI platform, and 4) Analysis of higi.'v-yrioritized features and parameters.

2.1. Cardiac state-inducing prototype
Cardiac state-inducing prototype comprises of sensor (AD 8232), arduino processor, W1-
Fi module, cloud server and LCD display. Sensor (AD 8232) along with three electrodes
connected as depicted in Fig. 1 (a) senses lead-I ECG signal from human body which will be
thereafter referred as ‘subject’ in this article. Arduino processor designed to work at 10 volts
reads unfiltered data directly from sensor with its 10 bit ADC pin and makes it legible by
amplifying and filtering out noisy part. An LCD display is featured here to see heart rate
locally Fig. 1(b). Wi-Fi module (ESP 8266) is used here to transmit lead-I ECG signal to the
internet linked HTTP server where the data is further analyzed and stored. The ECG signals
are collected from the subjects during the complete experimental prototype with a sampling
frequency of 9600 bps. A complete arrangement of cardiac statu-:sducing prototype is shown

in Fig. 2(a, b).

2.2 Data acquisition process

All the subjects were briefeau »bout the purpose and duration of the experiment. Prior to be
appeared on experiment, ele “tre des (Ag/AgCl) were placed on arteries of left and right arms
and right foot, as deg‘cte1 in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2(a), of subjects on the basis of an Einthoven
triangle placement. Cons: lidated contact in between Electrode and skin surface was ensured
to maintain a slightly warm and moist atmosphere in order to lower contact impedance and
obtain strong signal. All subjects were managed to seat on comfortable chair with one table in
front having a room atmosphere with no noise, adequate light and temperature 22+1 °C at
open air. Experiment was conducted for 30 minutes as illustrated in Fig. l(a), where each
subjects were asked to perform specially designed skill based mathematical task within 10
minutes, later in this dissertation this state will be revived as brainstorming state (BSS). A
relax time of 10 minutes was performed by each and every subjects before and after

performing mathematical tasks respectively, these two states will be revived as pre and post
brainstorming state. [Ilumination of green light on sensor indicates it receives data from

subjects as pictured in Fig. 2(a), this fact was ensured during the entire experiment.

analyzing data.

When the experiment gets commenced lead-I signals starts transferring from subject’s
body to device, here sensor starts reading, arduino processor starts amplifying and filtering,
Wi-Fi module starts transmitting the obtained data to the [oT cloud. Subsequently HTTP
server Starts storing data accordingly and all these events happen simultaneously. An operator
who have access to HTTP server, https://ecg-real-time.OOOwebhostapp.com, will be able to
monitor data storing process sitting remotely Fig. 2(c). Stored data in HTTP server is
compatible to be saved in .xlsx format for further analysis, transmission and calculation of
crucial supporting parameters. In this work data collected from server in .xlsx format has
been incorporated with newly developed GUI on MATLAB for further manipulation in order

to ascertain students’ psychological working competence.
2.3 Design of a GUI platform

Graphical user interface is an effective tools to monitor, analyze and assemble remote data
in order to reach decisive conclusion about patient’s health. In this work, GUI is designed to
perform certain tasks, helpful in analyzing and visualizing stored data as outlined in Fig. 2(d),
so that the operator who have little or no knowledge over data processing and the outcome of
the result can perform tasks by selecting specially designed buttons.

Several features like, loading ECG data, clearing previously plotted graphical signals are
built in GUI to perform basic tasks. For more analysis, options like, original ECG signal,
filtered ECG signal, detected peaks of the signal, Poincare plot, HRV, PSD, scalogram plot,
and 3-D spectrogram plot are incorporated in the designed GU: alatform to be visualized in
graphical form. Specially featured analytical parameters for instances, AHR, SDNN,
RMSSD, NNS5O, max RRI, min RRI, power (s*/Hz). -O-v: rlance, kurtosis, skewness of
uploaded data are made available at GUI so that ace4e:.'cian can guess the psychological
competence of subjects.

A decisive report of the experiment comprises c. mean RR interval (mean RRI), average
heart rate (AHR), index of centralization (IC, low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF/HF
ratio), stress index (SI) and psycholog.*al competence are picked on the GUI monitor to

assist the academician in order to reai.7e the tinal outcome of the diagnosis.

2.4 Analysis of highly-prioritized 1catures and parameters

Stored data in the server c. ntains unwanted noise moreover it is essential to adorn the
available data in the foric 0) medical terminologies, which makes this available data
subjected for further ana'ysis and modification. In order to establish interconnection between
cardiac patterns and br.in’s activities massive mathematical operative instruments, for
instances, 1) noise elimination, 11) detection of R-wave, 111) HRV analysis, iv) statistical
analysis, and v) time-frequency analysis have been subjected here to perform on concerned

data (an overall portrait has been outlined in Fig. 1(c)).

2.4.1 Noise elimination from ECG signal

In the dissertation, noises and unwanted signals in the received data arose from motion
artifacts, external interferences, baseline wandering, and power line frequency interference
was eliminated by using digital band pass filters. Normal ECG signal is low frequency signal
lies in range between 0.05 Hz to 100 Hz. It is established that R wave of ECG signal becomes

prominent within frequency range up to 35 Hz and amplitude of same signal varies from 10
HV to 5 mV [9]. A digital Butterworth band pass filter has been employed here to secure a
signal, recommended by American Heart Association (AHA) [10], devoid of baseline drift

and motion artifacts.

2.4.2 Detection of the R-wave

QRS complex is the most vital portion in the entire ECG signal where R-wave represents
most prominent spike and holds crucial information about pumping capacity of the heart.
Modified Pan—Tompkins algorithm helps detecting R-wave automatically when ECG data is
imported. To do so a threshold value of R-wave has been considered, on the basis of what R
waves are segregated for further processing.

2.4.3 HRV analysis

A commonly practiced tool works to estimate reg.latiin of cardiac autonomy also
describes variations between recurrent inter-beat-interva.c (R to R) is heart rate variability.
Physiological events, overwhelmed by local env'*cament, like psychological stress,
breathing, physical exercise, sleep and other 50 on putting significant effects on heart’s
performance can be indexed by HRV. Bein, a noninvasive electrocardiographic method it
also plays important role in determn.ns SNS and PNS function of ANS as well as
monitoring stress and cardiovascular ‘iseases. HRV analysis are classified into two types a)
linear analysis and b) nonlinear an/ty>.- this work has taken both this analyses on account
since they are entirely comptic'e with applications like ascertaining psychological
competence.

Linear HRV analysis x«rthex classified into two types i.e. time-domain features and
frequency domain featur 2s.) ime-domain features, came from detected R wave, comprises of
Mean RRI, SDNN, RN'SSD, NN50, MinRRI, MaxRRI, co-variance and SI features.
Frequency domain features evoked from fast Fourier transformed RR intervals are comprises
of power (will be discussed later by the name power spectral density-PSD), LF, HF, VLF,
LF/HF ratio and IC features. The PSD analysis in the frequency domain provides information
about how power is distributed as a function of frequency, it allows autonomic balance to be
quantified at any given time. PSD analysis acts on distinguishing and determining ANS
branches 1.e. SNS and PNS activities which are associated with spectral components [1.e., the
high-frequency band (HF), low-frequency band (LF), and very low frequency band (VLF)] of
HRV.

Nonlinear analysis made from RR intervals are comprises of Poincare descriptors (SD1,

SD2,SD1/SD2 ratio) features. All the early introduced features are described in table-2.

2.4.4 Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis in this work has been done in terms of kurtosis and skewness.

Kurtosis: The degree of peakedness of a distribution is measured by kurtosis, it also

reflects the stiffness of heart rate [13]. Increased kurtosis results in more concentrated of R-

waves around the mean. There are three types of Kurtosis, 1.e. leptokurtic, mesokurtic, and

platykurtic. Leptokurtic also known as positive kurtosis results when a sharp peak and heavy

tails are available on distribution. Mesokurtic usually defined as zero kurtosis is formed when
distribution resembles the normal distribution. Finally, platykurtic also known as negative
kurtosis happens on a distribution if thin tails and flat top forms on it.

Skewness: Skewness is a measure of symmetry of R-waves around the mean, basically it
measures the relative size of two tails. It reflects the loss of balance between SNS and PNS
activity of ANS in the cardiac system [14].

Skew[X]= e(4)

It is subdivided into three types, i.e. positive, negative «77 zero skewness. A positive
skewness aftermaths a tail that is longer in the right sia, ©. the PDF (probability density

correlation of skewness and kurtosis can be made wei, vositive skewness forms in parallel
with platykurtic distribution (-ve kurtosis), 1 g:tive skewness forms in parallel with
leptokurtic distribution (+ve kurtosis) an .ere skewness forms in parallel with mesokurtic

distribution.

2.4.5 Time-frequency analysis

Time-frequency analysis is a <'gna: processing technique that is used to analyze both time-
domain and frequency-dome‘n .*gnal to exhibit time variable spectral information. Time-
domain analysis provides .>fsrmation about amplitude affected by noise only, while
frequency-domain an.'y.*s ‘1olds out information about the spectral content of the signal
alone. Hence, time-frecur acy analysis offers the distribution of the signal’s spectrum over the
time-frequency plane and contains variation both in time and frequency to define the signal.
This analysis can be done using various promising transformation methods 1.e. scalogram plot
using continuous wavelet transform (CWT), 3D spectrogram plot using wavelet transform
(WT), and so on.

For an arbitrary discrete time of waveform of length n, the time frequency distribution is
calculated as follows [15].

_2afn 2

p,(n, f) = — ¥ wn —m)E(n)e  ™
Where E(n) is the discrete-time waveform, w(n) is the window function of length M that is
chosen to be less than N. A window functions such as Hamming window is used in the time-
frequency analysis. It is possible to investigate the nature of rhythms and differentiate among
various heart conditions through different control patterns. These patterns are understandable
by anyone without having knowledge of spectral analysis. Time-frequency analysis provides

clinically significant diagnostic information.

Scalogram plot: This plot using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to
produce time-scale representation which is _ indistinguishable to a_ time-frequency
representation of Fourier transform (FT). CWT is a promising technique in ECG that offers a
well-defined location of high-frequency components with a recoi.tion matched to its scale.
CWT holds more detailed information about beat to beat merraologies in the presence of
noise, it assists in identifying psychological responses. “l.> superiority of the wavelet-based
ECG approach is that R-wave abnormalities are «ssussed without the need for R-wave
endpoint identification [15].

CWT .(a,b) = J. fxcaty[—? f
al.
Where, w*(t) is the complex conjugate o1 mother wavelet, a is scale factor, and b is the

location parameter.

3D spectrogram plot: The ‘mn. 2-dimensional spectrogram plot using CWT provides more
accurate picture of the psychu'ogical competence due to morphological changes in intra-R
waves [15]. The three-d’.u..sional plots give time in one axis, the equivalent frequency on
another axis, and the CW: magnitude on the third axis. Despite the presence of noise, the
wavelet analysis will uuveil hidden time-frequency components of R waves at different

Stages.

3. Results and findings

The whole result section has been subdivided into four sections, 1) Pre-processing stage, 11)
Signal processing, and features extraction, 111) Time-frequency analysis, and iv) Outcome of
real mathematical test.

3.1 Preprocessing stage
Preprocessing stages comprises of acquisition of original ECG signal, filtering, and
detection of R waves for signal processing have been done in this work considering the data

of one subject only, since the outcome resembles for all the subjects.

3.1.1 Filtering of ECG signal
Initially obtained ECG signals are contaminated with different types of noises. In 2.4.1

processes and filters used to filter signals have been discussed.

Fig.3. Original ECG signal, fired ECG signal, and detected R waves of subject-1.

Original ECG signal collected fro the server has 3000 samples and it is divided into three
states i.e. pre-BSS, BSS, and >ost-BSS as depicted in Fig. 3. It has been filtered by
Butterworth band-pass filter ~it.. sampling frequency 50 Hz as shown in the second stage of
the figure to make it deve'4 Vf oaseline drift and motion artifact. For further investigation of
this signal two paran.cte.s ~.e. the amplitude of R-wave and RR interval are important in
order to correlate it with the psychological competence subject. To detect the R-wave from
the filtered signal Modified Pan—Tompkins algorithm has been used as depicted in the last
part of this figure. Three states in R-wave are conspicuous here as BSS has more frequent R-

waves compared to other states. The R-wave allows to derive the RR intervals and carry out

calculations of HRV in real-time.

3.1.2 HRV analysis
HRV in real-time as demonstrated in the Fig. 4, shows a heart rate versus RR intervals

curves for all five subjects. An abrupt change in heart rate for all the subjects have been

noticed during the transition from pre-BSS to BSS whereas the transition from BSS to post-
BSS represents a two stages change prior to become saturated. From the early discussion
(methodology section), it is evident HRV is sensitive to changes in ANS activity (1.e., SNS
and PNS) associated with physical or emotional stimuli. A combination of SNS and PNS
helps shape the regulation of heart rate. Both pre-BSS and post-BSS hold a PNS dominant
body while the BSS holds SNS dominant.

3.2 Signal processing and features extraction

Signal processing and features extraction in this dissertation are analyzed in three stages, 1)
linear feature analysis, 11) non-linear feature analysis and 111) statistical feature analysis.
Detected R-waves are the main key parameter based on what all form of further analysis is
going to be made. Features available in these analyses play a key role in formulating and

linking heart rate variation with the psychological competence of subjects.
3.2.1 Linear feature analysis

Linear analysis in this work is further classified into time-domain analysis and frequency

domain analysis has many parameters as outlined in table-3.

3.2.1.1 Time-domain analysis

In this work eight time-adumain parameters have been considered to demonstrate
psychological competence 1 >7ch subject.

Mean RRI for all ..e ."F ects found, as shown in Fig. 5(a), asymmetric in all the states. In
terms of numeric value ‘SS has lower values in contrast to other states for all the subjects.
This all points higher heart rate at BSS for all the subjects.

AHR of all the subjects has been found normal with typical values 60 bpm and 72 bpm
for pre and post BSS respectively. Moreover, BSS represents a towering AHR for all the
subjects Fig. 5(b). These variability’s in AHR symbolize an SNS dominant BSS and PNS
dominant pre and post BSS.

SDNN as depicted in Fig. 5(c) is more prominent in pre and post BSS, which symbolizes
ANS regulation and PNS dominancy in these states for all the subjects. As pre and post BSS
are states where subjects are set for relaxing, therefore, SDNN found in these states cannot be

dealt with ascertaining psychological competence.

Fig.5. Time domain analysis of the pre-processed signals; parameters represented in the figure are
consecutively a) mean of R to R interval, b) average heart rate, c) standard deviation of NN
intervals, d) root mean square of adjacent NN interval, e) coefficient of variance around the mean,

and f) stress index.
In the light of the asserted information in table-3, SDNN in BSS for different subjects
reveal their competency to solve mathematical tasks. Subject 1, 3, and 5 have better SDNN
profile (0.0197, 0.0228, and 0.0170 respectively) than the other two in BSS, which reveals
their proficiency in accomplishing ascertained tasks.

Effect of RMSSD on different states mirrors parasympathetic activity in the way to
control ANS regulation. Fig. 5(d) depicts BSS has significantly low RMSSD while other two
states hold potential RMSSD — in turn, this phenomenon shows, better SNS activity in the
BSS as subjects were set for performing cognitive tasks, whereas, pre and post BSS reveal
PNS dominancy because the brain is supposed to relax in these states.

NN5SO in this experiment reflects a resemblance among all tue subjects. BSS as shown in
table-3, has an identical value of 39 for all which indicates a bett :r SNS activity while doing
cognitive tasks. Poor NNS50O in pre and post BSS reveals su bjec s’ potential attention in BSS.

MinRRI and MaxRRI have a strong conspic™ou. correlation with HRV. As the
occurrence of heart rate is more frequent in BSS, thetc*c.e, minRRI and maxRRI as depicted
in table-3 are less significant (minRRI lies in ths ringe 0.2 to 0.22 and maxRRI in the range,
0.28 to 0.31) to other states’ for all the subiec.

Fig. 5(e) highlights a BSS, where sub, >ct |, 3, and 5 have noticeable co-variance of 0.004,
0005, and 0.003 respectively and othu-s have 0.0002. Post BSS indicates a significant change
from the other two states, as ths .‘*te is less important on account of ascertaining
psychological competence of the suc ‘ects, only BSS is crucial here to outlining this work.
Stress Index indicating the sti.ss handling capability of each subject plays a potential role in
finding who utilized his/hei tm st mental stress while performing cognitive tasks. As BSS in
the Fig. 5(f) details subj ct-. possesses maximum stress handling capacity with stress index
3.9745, whereas subjecr 1, 2, 4, and 5 possess 3.5247, 3.8774, 3.2371, and 3.8331
respectively. Stress index, itself, in particular, cannot ascertain psychological competence as
it reveals subjects’ stress taking ability for a specific duration of time. In this experiment, all
the subjects’ reinforced their stress handling capability while transiting from pre-BSS to BSS

and released as soon as their tasks were accomplished.

3.2.1.2 Frequency domain analysis

Features in this analysis as outlined in table-3 have been set to correlate psychological
competence of the subjects in different way.

PSD: Frequency domain allows exploring many signal features, which in time-domain 1s

difficult. The signal was transformed into the frequency domain using “Welch’s power
spectral density estimate” by considering Hamming’s window. It is apparent from the Fig.
6(a) that, each subject comes with unique power content in different states’. For instance,
subject-1 in the pre and post-BSS have power content of 280.37 and 280.14 s*/Hz
respectively, whereas, in BSS it’s value significantly drops to 209.12 s*/Hz. HRV signal
divided among VLF (0 — 0.04Hz), LF (0.04 — 0.15Hz), and HF (0.15 — 0.4Hz) deals with
SNS and PNS activity in each state. LF dealing both SNS, and PNS is more prominent at
BSS; VLF dealing with SNS are prominent at BSS; HF dealing with PNS is prominent at
both pre and post-BSS. From table-3 it has been demonstrated that VLF and LF hold more
power in the BSS while HF holds more power at both pre and post-BSS. Since pre and post-
BSS comprise of all frequency bands that’s why pre and post-Bo get higher power ratings in
contrast to BSS. Every subject comes up with the same outco.ne.

VLF: Fig. 6(b) reporting VLF has an eye-catching charge n its value for subject-3. Here,
VLF in BSS records 0.8130, an exceptionally hiche: value compared to other states.
Subjects-4 and 5 also show VLF that is higher in BSS <><a the other two states.

LF: Low-frequency analysis in this work con.e up with a resembling result for all the
subjects with an exception on subject-3. J.F ontent for subject 1, 2, 4, and 5 have a small

gain in BSS over pre and post BSS as de. cr’ved in Fig. 6(c).

HF: As depicted in (Fig. 6(d)), 1‘F for all the subjects getting reduced at BSS. A
significant change in HF noticed for Sut yect-3, wherein BSS HF found 0.0513 whereas in pre
and post-BSS measured HF are C 064u and 0.0641 respectively.

LF/HF ratio: LF to HF ra:‘o mirrors the parasympathetic activity of ANS. PNS mainly
leads to the conservation uo: *nergy and limiting cardiovascular activity when a subject/person
takes rest or gets relie1 “Yo.u physical or mental exercise. Almost identical LF/HF reported in

both pre and post BSS a. shown in Fig. 6(e).

Subjects get engaged in performing mathematical tasks in BSS reflects dominant SNS
activity of ANS in this state for all the subjects. Active and dominant SNS in this state is the
cause for both higher cardiac movement and higher LF/HF ratio. Pre and post BSS record an
average value of LF/HF by 2.637 where BSS records 2.647.

Index of centralization: Index of centralization pertaining to the central control of the
cardiac rhythm is associated with the brain’s functional state and calculated in each state for
every subject using the equation mentioned in table-1. A rise in IC indicates an increased

involvement of VLF and LF band to that particular state.

Particularly, S-1, 3, and 5 having IC around 18.5, possess better brain engagement while

solving cognitive tasks in BSS.

3.2.2. Non-linear analysis

Non-linear mechanism involved in complex heart rate regulation has been used in this
work to identify the location of the non-linear HRV components. When R-waves disappear
due to the occurrence of an arrhythmia, it becomes difficult to track irregular R-waves.

SD1/SD2: The Poincare descriptors (SD1, SD2, and SD1,SD2Z) of heart rate dynamics can
be better identified by dynamic analysis of Poincaré plot han traditional analysis techniques
of HRV. SD1 and SD2 are the standard deviations ner, -ndicular to and along the line-of-
identity (RR, = RRy+:) respectively. Sympathovag.! Valance is being mirrored on the
SD1/SD2 ratio. Different vagal activities get sc: egated upon the application of this ratio
which is not possible in a linear analysis. Fre: Fiy. 7(a) it is noticed that for all the subjects

BSS has comparatively higher SD1/SD2 the other two states.

3.2.3. Statistical analysis

There are two types of statistical axua ysis of HRV in time-domain. 1) Analysis calculating
RR intervals and 11) Analysis ¢ Ucunating differences of consecutive NN intervals. In this
work, RR intervals based calcslations are considered for further analysis. The statistical
analysis of HRV signals a.:nlays a significant departure from normality as reflected by
kurtosis and skewnes.

Kurtosis: In this worl, as shown in the Fig. 7(b), kurtosis in BSS are easily noticeable for
all the subjects. Pre and post BSS are noticed with poor kurtosis to BSS, which indicates a
more stiffed heart rate and positive kurtosis in BSS. Kurtosis measured from subject-1 to 5
are 3.5712, 3.8925, 3.0339, 3.808, and 2.4431 respectively.

Skewness: As shown in Fig. 7(c), all five subjects are having positive skewness at BSS
and negative skewness in the other two states, an exception results for subject-3 in pre-BSS.
Skewness in BSS are found consecutively 0.33, 0.04, 0.54, 1.73, and 0.26 for subject-1
through 5. In BSS, since all the skewness are positive, the tail of the skewness are longer on
the right side of the PDF and the balance between SNS and PNS activity of ANS are formed
where SNS is dominant to PNS for all the subjects.

3.3. Time-frequency 2n. lvs-s

Limitations of the pow er spectral analysis are that it represents only the frequency content
of the signal and does not give any additional information such as regularity or irregularity of
R waves. Outcome of time-frequency analysis in terms of scalogram plot and 3-D
spectrogram plot are outlined in the following articles.
Scalogram Plot

Each heartbeat is a group of distinct cardio-logical events, represented by significant
features in the ECG signal of different subjects as depicted in Fig. 8. By checking those
features, the pattern of R-wave recognition in different states of each subject is estimated. In
BSS, where recording time is in between 10 min to 20 min, as the subject is engaged in

performing a psychological task, distinguishable rhythmic patterns are found.

High-frequency componce.*ts of the signal that reacts to the steep changes are carried out
by low scales, while 'o\’-fr.quency information are available on the high scales. At BSS,
subject 1, 3,4, and 5 have higher frequency components with well-defined contours in time
that shows good information about beat to beat morphologies. Therefore, those subjects
having rhythmic patterns of high-frequency components possess good psychological
competence. Subjects 1, 3, 5 have been found with approximately equivalent psychological
competence in where subject 3 has attained more psychological competence due to continuity
of contours in BSS. Subject 2 has low psychological competence because of decaying

contours during BSS.

Three-dimensional spectrogram plot
Fig. 9 shows the three-dimensional spectrogram plots of different subjects for each of the

three states of this experiment availing the recordings only from single limb lead. During pre

and post BSS, a sharp peak appears to indicate the correlation between active neuronal

function and cardiac rhythm. In those states, the cardiac rate varies periodically with neurons

to control the synaptic transmission.

Moreover, a decay of peak appears during BSS due to arrhythmic episodes for performing

the psychological tasks. R-waves frequency components with a peak during BSS of the heart

were observed for subjects 1, 3, 5, which disappeared for subjects 2 and 4. So the peak at

BSS denotes more synaptic transmission of neuronal activity that provides an indication of

effective and high psychological competence than subjects 2 auc 4. At post-BSS, the normal

looking peak with the red color of intra-R waves is restored 1 all subjects.

4. Discussion

A real-time wireless cardiac state-inducing protc.y,> suitable and comfortable for
personal use has been developed and implemented to. collecting, primarily filtering, and
transmitting the cardiac rhythmic data to the cloryd s-rver. This ECG signals have been
further analyzed and considered as principa in struments to multiple feature analyses
particularly at specially designed GUI pla‘ic-m.

Data acquisition from a local serve:, Preprocessing of uploaded ECG signal, HRV
analysis, linear and non-linear feature analysis, statistical feature analysis, time-frequency
analysis and their graphical represe1.t’ tions have been carried out at ease on MATLAB based
GUI.

In the pre-processing stag*>. u.ree conspicuous states in R waves namely, pre-BSS, BSS,
and post-BSS have been »ouced when the signal was filtered and ready for further analysis.
Change in heart rate “vo.> t.1e normal range at BSS has been found for all the subjects in
HRVanalysis. ANS ac*'y.ty pertaining to physical and psychological events discussed and
demonstrated in terms of PNS and SNS activity for all the subjects, where BSS has been
reported as SNS dominant state while the other two states found in PNS dominancy.

From time-domain analysis of the linear features, comparative psychological competence
of subjects has been appraised using several parameters. Mean RRI and AHR come up with
better cardiac activities at BSS for all, while SDNN implies subjects 3, 1, and 5 have better
proficiency in accomplishing ascertained tasks. Parasympathetic activity to control ANS is
revealed by RMSSD, where BSS has been concluded with better SNS activity. A higher
value of NN50 at BSS draws subjects’ potential attention in the mathematical test compared

to other states. Another parameter ‘co-variance’ confirms subject 3, 1, and 5 have higher
performance in BSS compared to other subjects. One of the significant parameters in time
domain features is the Stress index, it indicates the stress handling capacity of each subject in
a particular moment. All the subjects have been noticed with potential SI in BSS. Pre-BSS
shows comparatively higher SI to post-BSS because of the fact that subjects had to bear latent
mental stress before appearing on the test. Considering individual cases, subject 4 has
revealed considerably less SI at BSS.

Frequency domain analysis takes a frequency component of the signal to analyze and
reaches at a conclusion to appraise psychological competence in a different way. From PSD
analysis, BSS for all the subjects has been confirmed with the significant presence of VLF
and LF whereas the other two states show the entire HF domu.cncy. Subject-3 possesses a
noteworthy result in VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF analysis whicl. are substantially different from
other subjects. VLF solely dealing with SNS has been found < ppreciable whereas HF mainly
dealing PNS found surprisingly poor for subject-3. AJ! ot..>r subjects have been reported with
remarkably similar outcomes for all these parameters. ""uex of centralization one of the most
prominent parameter in frequency domain ana'ys.s outlines subject-1, 3, and 5 have better
ANS activity at BSS.

The non-linear analysis involved i.. complex heart rate regulation analysis like the
formation of arrhythmia has outlined - findings in terms of SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2. Where,
all the subjects come up with simila nu. eric value and possessed a balanced ANS activity.

Significant departures from 10: ality reflected by kurtosis and skewness have been
remarked in statistical analysis. Positive kurtosis and slightly positive skewness at BSS for all
the subjects’ aftermath a sherp { vak, heavy tail, SNS dominancy, and the peak is longer at the
right side of the PDF

Time-domain and freg 1ency-domain analysis cannot draw a particular outline rather this
analysis support the main outcome from their standpoint view. From this realization, time-
frequency analysis in terms of Scalogram Plot and three-dimensional spectrogram plot have
been incorporated in this work, that helps set, along with other analysis, a specific judgment.
In this dissertation, scalogram plot reveals subject-3, 1, and 5 have similar psychological
competence whereas S-3 possesses second to none after-effect due to the continuity of
contour at BSS. In terms of a three-dimensional spectrogram plot, identical subjects (3, 1, and
5) have been reported more competent than others.

Individually secured score in the mathematical test draws an upshot where subject-3, 1, 5,

4, and 2 earned 90%, 70%, 60%, 50%, and 30% of the total score respectively.
In a nutshell, upshots of the time domain parameters settle subject 3, 1, 5, 2, and 4
respectively by ranks in terms of their competency. Furthermore, frequency domain features
seal subject 5, 1, 3, 2, and 4 in order. Non-linear analysis stresses more on Sympathovagal
balance, whereas, the statistical analysis highlights the SNS and PNS activities of ANS and
finally draws SNS dominancy in conclusion. In time-frequency analysis, both scalogram and
3-D spectrogram plot prompt an identical sequence where subjects 3, 1, 5, 4, and 2 stand
accordingly. Anatomization of this result and evaluated mathematical test outcome reveals
the ultimate conclusion by placing subjects 3, 1,5, 4, and 2 respectively from the top in terms

of their psychological competence for this experiment.

5. Conclusion

Successful implementation of real-time wireless ca diac state-inducing prototype for
capturing and transmitting cardiac signals from the hvu™«., body to any part of the world with
a view to sharing this signal with academicians has b. >: ensured in the first segment of this
work. An effective MATLAB based GUI has De_n designed and its fruitful application in
ECG signal processing has been vindicated. ?sycnological competence of the five subjects
have been ascertained by the combi.7d study and investigation of linear, non-linear,
statistical, and time-frequency featui.s analysis of the cardiac signal. Anatomization of the
signal processing outcome and the ..1thematical test ramification validate the overall
system’s canvass.

Critical patients and key du ~ision-makers are the potential sources for this system to be
applied in order to ascerta.1 th-ir psychological presence on the respective situation. Only
lead-I signal has been c ynsi ered in this work is a subject to be extended. Furthermore, the
implication of this syste:1 on diversified subjects and annexation of manifold signals like

EEG, EMG with ECG can play a vital factor in the mass acceptance of the system.

Highlights (Review)
Cardiac state-inducing prototype to measure ECG signal form human body has been
advanced in the first stage of the work
A GUI based on MATLAB platform has been designed in order to analysis the
obtained signal and extract premeditated features helpfu' cor ascertaining
psychological competence of the participants.
Signal processing and feature extractions have bee du 1e in three stages
o Pre-processing stage
= R-wave detection
= Heart rate variability analve‘s
o Signal processing and feature e .tiu.ct.ons
» Linear analysis
= Non-linear analysis
» Statistical ana’, ~is
o Time-frequency ar-'vs.°
Parameters found after ‘1gn.' processing and analysis helps defining the bodies
hormonal, physical ana . bsequently psychological changes in response to the
environmental ck ang *s they are going through.
Anatomization 0. all the early mentioned processes helps reach to ascertain
psychological competence of the participants.
Result of determined psychological competence of the participants has been validated
analyzing the result of skill-based mathematical test and the outcome of the GUI

report.
