Keywords: To expand our knowledge of the climate in the Lesser Antilles, we attempted to identify the spatio-temporal

climate informatics, as well as for many applications that cluster physical fields. We illustrated the pitfalls with
a dataset of cumulative rainfall from NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission for the period 2000 to 2014.
First, the pitfall is the lack of numerical evaluation of the clusters found by the algorithms, which prevents the
comparison of algorithms. We used silhouette index for this evaluation and to demonstrate other problems.
Second, algorithms like K-means cluster the points around their barycentre. For many physical fields, this
barycentre is trivial, which may lead to poor performances. Third, the L2 norm used in conventional clustering
methods, such as K-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, focus on the exact location of fields,
which leads to poor evaluations of similarity between fields. We replaced it by a similarity measure called the
expert distance (ED) that compares the histograms of four zones, based on the symmetrised Kullback—Leibler
divergence. It integrates the properties of the observed physical parameter and climate knowledge. With these
improvements, the results revealed five clusters with high indexes. The algorithms now discriminate the daily
scenarios favourably, thereby providing more physical meaning to the resulting clusters. The interpretation of
these clusters as weather types is discussed.

of a numeric evaluation of the clusters’ quality. The evaluation of the

The automatic identification of spatio-temporal structures that are
indicative of the atmosphere’s low frequency variability has long been
known as an important research objective (Michelangeli et al., 1995;

for Jury and Malmgren (2012) that will be discussed later), is as
follows: for a selected physical parameter, a day is characterised by
a spatial field that can be visualised as a map. The days that constitute

low homogeneity (producing clusters that contain very distinct situa-
tions) and low separation (producing clusters faintly distinct from each
other). When this point has been established, we analyse the origin of
the problems with these methods, which have two main causes.

First, the use of L2 as a similarity measure between two spatial fields
raises questions. We show that the distance L2, used to compare two
days, does not show the following basic characteristic: the proximity of
two days in the sense of the retained distance must be equivalent to the
proximity between them from a physical point of view. To overcome
this, we propose a pseudo-distance to cluster spatio-temporal rainfall
fields. We provide a physical explanation for the principles that led to
the definition of this pseudo-distance and show how incorporating it
will enable further realistic results.

Second, the use of a field average of a cluster days (its centroid)
as the main representative of a cluster (Jain, 2008; Gokila et al.,
2016) also raises questions. The rainfall dataset used in this study
has many spatial discontinuities that can probably explain the poor
results obtained by traditional methods. All the previous researchers
used algorithms like KMS that aggregate days around centroids on
more continuous datasets. The majority of the studies describe the
final centroids of the clusters as a WT. However, for the type of data
used in this study, this is trivial because this average may not be the
representative of an existing physical scenario. The pseudo-distance
that we propose improves this phenomenon when clustering.

To describe the resulting clusters, we present the most represen-
tative days of each cluster (not an average), which seem to be more
relevant endpoint. These clusters are related to the WTs and circulation
types (CTs) presented in the previous study. We consider their intra-
and interannual dynamics to understand their links with the seasons
and the interseasons. A specific analysis by island allowed us to under-
stand the impact of these rainfall patterns on the Lesser Antilles, and
we also compared satellite observation data (used for clustering) with
data from ground rainfall stations.

The data used and the methodology developed are presented in
Section 2. Section 3 provides an evaluation of the results obtained for
the study and a discussion of the important aspects of the results. It
is divided into the following two parts: at first, we present a numeric
comparison of methods, discuss our choices of parameters, and evaluate
the quality of the resulting clusters to show that our method gives
significantly better results than traditional methods; then, we provide
a physical analysis by relating the clusters produced by this method
to the existing knowledge on climatology in the Caribbean region. The
last section is dedicated to the conclusions and perspectives.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Datasets

The study data consist of rainfall measured by the satellites of the
Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (Huffman et al., 2007).
These data were spatialised with a grid of 0.25° longitude x 0.25°
latitude. The geographic zone ranges from —66.25 to —20.25°E and
from 5 to 30°N. It includes the Lesser Antilles islands along with the
northeastern part of South America and a part of the Central Atlantic
Ocean with the Cape Verde archipelago (cf Fig. 1). Each day was thus
represented by a field of 101 x 187 values, which were transformed
into a vector of 18,887 components. The data covered the period from
2000 to 2014, representing a base of 5415 days.

To determine recurring situations from the rainfall field, we used
conventional clustering methods such as the HAC or KMS (Monteleoni
et al., 2013; Rokach and Maimom, 2010; Parmar and Saket, 2017).
Notably, in the climate datasets, a field is a vector in a space with
very large dimensions (18,887 pixels in our case), which made the
search for relevant information relatively complex. To assess the study
area, surface rainfall data supplied by Meteo France (Guadeloupe and
Martinique) from 1979 to 2014 were used in the design of the expert

distance (ED) (Section 2.4). To complete the analysis and interpretation
of the clustering results, atmospheric circulation data at 850hPa from
ERA-5 collected by radiosondes from Wyoming Weather from 1979 to
2014, and tropical storm and hurricane tracking data from 2000 to
2014 indexed on Unisys Weather were used (Section 3).

2.2. Clustering performance measures

As pointed out in Section 2.4, current publications in the field lack
an important element, namely, they do not provide reliable, quanti-
tative performance measures that indicate the quality of the resulting
clusters. For example, in the article by Chadee and Clarke (2015),
only the centroids of the clusters were evaluated and the clusters
were considered to be correct because the centres were plausible and
physically interpretable. However, the dispersion of the clusters was
not evaluated.

The absence of such quantitative quality measurements is particu-
larly problematic when it comes in comparing the clustering methods.
It is necessary to implement a way to measure the quality of the
clusters, even if quality is recognised in the literature as a challenging
problem, primarily in the cases where it is difficult to form hypotheses
on the shape of the clusters searched for Tibshirani et al. (2001),
Halkidi et al. (2001) and Lallich and Lenca (2015).

In the absence of ground truth information, here is a list of some
internal quality measurements that can be used with the clusters: the
silhouette index (Rousseeuw, 1987), Calinski-Harabasz index (Caliski
and Harabasz, 1974), and Davies—Bouldin index (Davies and Bouldin,
1979). All of them combine the following two essential qualities ex-
pected for clusters representing different physical situations: compact-
ness (homogeneity) as well as distance (separation). We selected the
silhouette index because it has the following benefits:

* It provides a quality measure for each day within its cluster, for
each cluster, and for the method through all its resulting clusters,
* It is easy to interpret in terms of the pertinence of clusters.

Let us assume a clustering algorithm M, that divides a dataset into k
clusters. At the end of the clustering process, each point i of the data
is assigned to a specific cluster C,. The silhouette index S(i) for each i
is obtained as follows:
b(i) — a(i)

max(a(i), b(i))’
where a(i) is the average of the distances between i and the other
elements in its cluster and b(i) is the minimum of the averages of the
computed distances between i and the elements of every other cluster.
In Eqs. (2) and (3), d(i, j) expresses the distance used to compare two
elements i and j, as shown below:

— YY ans, (2)

a; = ——

and

b; = minja ie d d(i, j), (3)

where C, is the cluster of i and |C,| the size of C,;. By default, this

distance d(i,j) is the L2 norm. In this work, we will replace the

L2 distance with ED (Eq. (9)). Two other criteria may be estimated.

The first, which indicates the average quality of a cluster C,, can be

calculated by using the following formula:

— ¥ Si). (4)

Sc(C,) = —
c( i) IC] &

In order to evaluate all of the clusters obtained by applying a clustering
method M, to our data, we can consider the average of each cluster’s
coefficients, namely:

k
Sa(M,) = 7 >! Se(C)). (5)
i=l

By definition, each coefficient is between —1 and 1. The coefficient
reflects the combined evaluation of the proximity of an element to the
elements of its cluster and the distance of this element to all the other
clusters.

Sa(M,) provides an indication of the quality of the result of a clus-
tering method. For more information, readers can refer to Rousseeuw
(1987). Here are some commonly accepted reference values that we
will use later:

* values greater than 0.20 indicate good performance (existence of
relevant and well separated clusters),

* values less than 0.10 indicate the opposite,

* negative values indicate that many points are assigned to clusters
that do not represent the best possible choice.

2.3. Problems related to the L2 distance

All the work we were able to review in this domain uses the same
distance measurement to compare two fields, namely, the distance
associated with the L2 norm. For the record, this distance between two
vectors of daily data D,(v,, U5,...,v,) and D,(v,, V2,...,v,) is calculated
as follows:

 

n

Yi Di(v) = Drv), (6)

i=]

dy7(D,, Dy) =

where D,(u;) is the ith value v of the vector of daily data D, and n
is the length of vectors of daily data. This distance seems to be partly
responsible for the difficulties encountered by the clustering methods
in the field of climate informatics (Monteleoni et al., 2013). Fig. 2(a)
shows this property schematically, in which the distance L2 found
between the reference (in black) and the two fields is the same. In
addition, for fields such as rainfall, which show extensive spatial and
temporal irregularities, a day D, with a low spatial disparity relative
to the reference (Fig. 2(b)) will have a norm L2 equivalent to a day
Dy», red curve, with a bigger spatial disparity. Thirdly, when data are
described in a large vector space, a multitude of small fluctuations that
are spatially spread across the field can be considered as important as
one single big and very localised fluctuation.

2.4. Design of the expert distance

In this section, as with other authors in different application fields
before (Pandit and Gupta, 2011; Parmar and Saket, 2017; Gibbs and
Su, 2002; Shraddha and Suchita, 2011), we propose an alternative
similarity measure based on the fact that the correction, even slight,
of L2’s biggest weaknesses should result in significant improvements.
The construction of the proposed measure will reduce the influence of
the spatial location by a suitable subdivision and a quantification.

2.4.1. Partial management of spatialisation

For several computer vision applications, the image can be analysed
at the patch level rather than at the individual pixel level (Barnes
et al., 2011; Dinu et al., 2012; Amelio and Pizzuti, 2016). Image
patches contain contextual information and have advantages in terms
of computations and generalisations (Guo and Dyer, 2007). From this
point of view, the decomposition of an image into patches or zones that
do not overlap provides a simple but effective way of overcoming the
curse of dimensionality (Xin, 2017).

In this study, we subdivided the rainfall field of the North Atlantic
tropical zone into four patches (Fig. 1) to limit the computation time
and demonstrate the value of the approach without seeking to optimise
it. The definition of these zones serves an important purpose, namely, to
take the knowledge of field experts into consideration. Thus, each zone
corresponds to a specific and known centre of action. In Fig. 1, Al is
the zone in which the cold surges originate; A2 is the North Atlantic
Subtropical High (NASH) zone; A3 is influenced by the continental
zone and the arc of the Lesser Antilles; and A4 is the zone of low
pressure that is linked to the presence of the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ). To compare two fields, we subdivided the fields accord-
ing to these four zones and then compared each of them with their
correspondent.

2.4.2. Comparison of the distribution of intensities

Once each field had been spatially subdivided, we no longer had to
pinpoint the exact location of the phenomena in each zone. It seems
relatively reasonable to ignore their position down to the exact mesh,
and instead we looked at the distribution of the rainfall intensities of
the observed field, ignoring the notion of spatial location. In the ab-
sence of knowledge of the form of the distribution of rainfall intensities,
the Kullback—Leibler divergence appears to be a judicious choice (Kwitt
and Uhl, 2008; Kullback and Leibler, 1951; Walker et al., 2004). It is
expressed as follows:

P(c)
O(c)’

where P and Q are two distributions of discrete probabilities and c is
the index of possible values taken from each distribution. To obtain
a metric for R, that also has the symmetry property, we will use the
symmetrised divergence of Kullback-Leibler, namely:

 

Dx, (P,Q) = ¥) P(o)log (7)

Dxrs(P, Q) = Dg (P,Q) + Dx Q, P). (8)

Although it is possible to define a measure of the Kullback—Leibler
divergence adapted to continuous fields, we preferred to quantify the
data differently because estimating the probability densities of the
intensities raises parametrisation problems. Moreover, such quantifica-
tion might help to reduce the effects of the small fluctuations noted
in Section 2.3, even though edge effects around the boundaries of the
selected intensity classes remain. The histogram bins were determined
from the rainfall data collected in the area. We selected eight bins of

possible intensities. The boundaries of these bins were selected from
the rainfall data collected in the area such that the distribution of the
bins was uniform (cf. Table 1).

The distinct intensity distributions obtained were then used to
compute the Kullback—Leibler divergence in each zone. The average of
the divergences by zone provides the distance between two days. We
call this the expert distance, which is referred to as ED, and the quantity
is defined by:

where D, et D, are days and D,.Z; is the histogram of the zone with

in Fig. 1. All the operations listed above are summarised in Fig. 3.

3. Results and discussion

In this section, we present the results and discuss the results at
first from a computer science point of view. The last subsection will
be dedicated to an analysis of the results for the specific application
considered.

3.1. Performance measurements of clustering methods

We used algorithms such as HAC and KMS with which we sep-
arately linked L2 and ED. To reveal the possibilities of using these
two distances, the evaluation of the quality of the clusters obtained by
HAC-L2, KMS-L2, HAC-ED, and KMS-ED was performed by computing

the silhouette coefficients (Eq. (5)). Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the
silhouette coefficient as a function of the number k of clusters.

The results showed several interesting points for the comparison
between KMS and HAC, which are summarised below. Notably, the
methods based on the HAC algorithm produced coefficients that were
significantly lower than those obtained by KMS algorithms. Addition-
ally,

* For HAC-ED, the silhouette coefficient approached O for k > 3,
thus indicating the irrelevance of the clusters detected.

* HAC-L2 exhibited negative silhouette coefficients, thus indicating
that the points were affected by suboptimal clusters.

* HAC-ED produced results superior to HAC-L2, although the per-
formance of both remained very weak.

We can now eliminate the HAC algorithms and focus on KMS. This
choice is in line with the literature (Chadee and Clarke, 2015), in which
HAC has been used only to define the initial centroids of the KMS
algorithm by ruling out any random selection of these centroids. Here,

* KMS-ED largely outperformed KMS-L2.

* KMS-ED exhibited values mainly over 0.2 for a significant number
of clusters, thus indicating the presence of relevant structures
within the data.

* KMS-L2 exhibited values under 0.1 for k > 2, thus indicating

irrelevant clusters.

Although the shape of the curves generally decreased with k, a

slight inflection was observed around k = 5 in both cases.

* For this value of k = 5, KMS-L2 had a silhouette value of 0.08,
whereas KMS-ED had a value of 0.26.

The selection of the optimal k was not as clear-cut as we had hoped,
in spite of the noted inflection around k = 5 in both cases. This led
us to choose this number of clusters for the following analyses. When
considering large maritime areas with little land surface, such as the
Caribbean region (Fig. 1), according to authors of earlier works Vigaud
and Robertson (2017), Moron et al. (2016), Chadee and Clarke (2015)
and Saenz and Duran-Quesada (2015), the number of WTs obtained by
using KMS or HAC can range from 7 to 11. Hence, five WTs seems a
bit low in regard to the literature.

3.2. Visual inspection of the clusters found

For the present time, we have relied on the silhouette index for our
analysis. Let us now show how the values of the silhouette index are

by their algorithms. The idea behind this is that these averaged fields
are representative of the clusters. Fig. 6 show why we believe this idea
should be discarded when dealing with discontinuous fields such as
rainfalls. It shows, for a specific cluster found by KMS-L2, the centroid
(Fig. 6(a)), the nearest day to the centroid (Fig. 6(b)) and a random
day of the same cluster (Fig. 6(c)).

This figure shows the following interesting aspects. The centroid
does not look like any of the members of the cluster considered. We
think that computing the average tends to create continuous artificial
zones, which gives a bad spatial appreciation of the existing mete-
orological structures and leads to poor results for the clustering of
spatio-temporal rainfall fields using L2. This problem can be partially

rainfall in each region. These distributions are much more meaningful
for describing rainfall situations. For the following analysis, we will
consider, as a representative of the cluster, not the centroid but the
most representative element of each cluster obtained. This is the ele-
ment with the shortest distance to each cluster centroid (distance being

L2 or ED in their respective cases).

3.2.3. Separation and homogeneity of the clusters

As stated several times in this article, we prefer to rely on a single
performance measure than on a multitude of considerations. We need,
however, to prove that this performance measure is a good indicator
of these considerations. This section is dedicated to the separation and
homogeneity of the clusters.

of the clusters obtained by the KMS-L2 and KMS-ED methods for k = S.
These figures also show, for each representative field, the wind field
of the corresponding day. This wind field has not been used during
the clustering. It will be used in the physical analysis of the weather
types extracted by our method, later in this article. Those representative
fields (both rainfall and wind) should be as different as possible.

Fig. 7 clearly shows that for KMS-L2, clusters C2 and C3 in fact
depict situations that are quite similar with rainfall in the southeast.
C1 and C5 are also similar and depict low rainfall across the space and
an atmospheric circulation originating mainly from the northeast. The

exact spatial location of these rainfall situations is the only thing that
distinguishes them, thus illustrating precisely the limits of L2.

The results obtained for KMS-ED, shown in Fig. 8, highlight, con-
versely, very diverse clusters. Each case shows centres that are more or
less active.

3.2.3.2. Homogeneity. We also wanted to evaluate the homogeneity
(the internal variability) of the clusters obtained for each method. Of
these five clusters, for the sake of conciseness, we will present only
one cluster per method. For each method. we selected the cluster

L2 method and the C4 cluster for the KMS-ED method. The distance
of each of the days composing a cluster to their representative was
computed, and elements were sorted in ascending order. We extracted
six quantiles from this ranking, to evaluate how each cluster varied

internally. Fig. 9 shows the quantiles obtained for KMS-L2. Fig. 10 does
the same for KMS-DE.

In the case of the L2 distance (Fig. 9), the first three fields were
relatively similar to the representative element, whereas the last two
were different. In fact, on the central part and the northwestern edge,
we found rainfall zones that were well localised. When grouping the

results by the L2 distance, we observed a cluster of situations that were
certainly similar in terms of numbers but very distinct from a physical
point of view.

In the case of ED (Fig. 10), the elements of cluster C4 had a
certain physical constancy although they differed slightly in their visual
appearance. This cluster consisted of low rainfall fields.

3.2.3.3. Conclusion on the intrinsic quality of clusters. The visual in-
spection confirmed the results observed by using only the silhouette
index.

* KMS-L2 produced clusters of relative relevance, as some clus-
ters representative were similar. Moreover, days among a cluster
could be very different from a physical point of view.

* KMS-L2 produced more relevant clusters, which were reflective
of diverse situations. Among a cluster, days seemed similar.

From the point of view of the physical separation of the clusters,
the introduction of the ED has clearly enabled the acquisition of clusters
with a much higher relevance. In addition to the better results obtained
by KMS-ED, this facet tends to reinforce that clusters with a high
silhouette index are more relevant when it comes to their physical
significance.

3.3. Physical analysis

As stated in the introduction, we wanted to pinpoint some pitfalls
encountered when clustering daily fields in geoscience applications.
We attempted to highlight them and present some partial solutions
to these problems in the previous sections. This section will focus
on the remarkable results obtained by our simple method as soon as
these problems are dealt with. Our major goal was to extract typical
geospatial structures of meteorological data, focusing only on rainfall.
Some authors, like Jury and Malmgren (2012), have used several fields
E. Biabiany et al.

such as the surface temperature, sea-level pressure, and U zonal wind
to extract dominant modes with the help of a principal component
analysis (PCA). While such a combined analysis of different fields is
something we aim to do in the future, our article focuses on only one
field (rainfall) to illustrate the general method we are proposing.

In our method, we chose to aggregate spatial areas in a controlled
way (by using regions) to add as much physical knowledge as we could
acquire in the design of the extraction of WTs. An interesting aspect
of our study comes despite one of its limitations, namely, we treated
each day independently and clustered days by taking no account of the
time dependency between them, apart for the one found in the data
themselves (this is a common approach).

We propose a physical analysis of the clusters obtained by look-
ing at their intra- and interannual evolutions on a large scale. Then,
we will continue the study of the meteorological comparability of
daily precipitation at the local scale, including, in this case, surface
observations.

3.3.1. Large scales

3.3.1.1. Annual variability and trends. It is thus very interesting to
observe the temporal distribution of the fields contained in each cluster
to highlight possible annual and semi-annual cycles, as in Chadee and
Clarke (2015). The frequencies were derived by applying the cluster
analysis technique KMS-L2 and KMS-ED to the daily atmospheric pre-
cipitation patterns defined over the domain indicated in Fig. 1. We
also show the results of Mann—Kendall’s nonparametric trend test (Yue
et al., 2002), which was performed on the annual frequencies of each
group to test the null hypothesis of no trend at the 95% confidence
level (5% significance level). Radiosonde parameters at different levels,
such as specific humidity, wind direction, and intensity, were used
to characterise the clusters. The days in each of the clusters would
thus compare to several configurations in terms of outgoing longwave
radiation (OLR), sea surface temperature (SST), and wind circulation.
We will try, as far as possible, to link them to the clusters found in
previous study (Chadee and Clarke, 2015; Moron et al., 2016; Martinez
et al., 2019).

For KMS-L2, the results are shown in Fig. 11. On the left, we show
the annual variability of the monthly frequencies of days making up
each cluster, whereas the right side shows the inter-year change. Many
of them have a similar annual distribution. Moreover, no significant
trends over the 15 years of TRMM observations were found. This result
confirms that the L2 distance is still not very appropriate for classifying
daily rainfall fields, as it weakly reflects the seasonality effects for the
TRMM daily rainfall.

For KMS-ED, Fig. 12, the monthly distributions obtained were
clearly separated because they better integrated regional physical and
climatic knowledge. With this slight improvement, the results revealed
five clusters (k = 5) with high indexes (Sa(M,) > 0.2), which can be
characterised as follows :

* C1, represents 14.8% of the days analysed, with days spread over
the whole 12 months, but data remained rather grouped over the
first part of the year. The maximum was centred on the months of
April and May. This cluster was associated with CTs 1 to 5 found
in Chadee and Clarke (2015) and WTs 1 to 3, 7, and 8 found
in Moron et al. (2016). There were no significant trends for the
annual frequencies.

C2 and C3, 12.5 and 10.4% respectively were close to each other
because they were localised at the end of the year. However,
for C2, the maximum matched with September—October, whereas
for C3, this occurred in November. Decreases in the annual fre-
quencies were found for C2 (p-value = 0.02 and r* = 0.439),
whereas there were no significant trends for C3. These clusters
were associated with WTs 4,5,6, and 8 in Moron et al. (2016).

Computers and Geosciences 145 (2020) 104612

* C4 was the most prevalent type, in which it accounted for 32%
of the days. The elements of this one were mainly distributed
from December to April with a peak in February. It represents
the cluster of the dry season. The annual distribution showed
a marked “dip” between July and November (Fig. 12). Fig. 13
shows observations of the upper atmosphere at station 78897-
TFFR Le Raizet. The daily precipitation fields of C4 showed a
thin wet layer, which dried out at 800 hPa. In the lower levels,
the trade winds were from the northeast, whereas for the levels
below 500 hPa, the flow was predominantly from the northwest.
In this case, the drivers, which are the NASH and the SST, limited
the intensity of the observed rainfall (Davis et al., 1997; Dunion,
2011; Moron et al., 2015). The NASH and the North American
High are connected together and provide strong diverging trade
winds and subsidence in the Caribbean. The ITZC migrates south-
wards favouring the development of the southern flank of NASH
(Martinez et al., 2019). A detailed analysis of C4 indicated the
presence of heavy precipitation. These conditions were related to
cold fronts that managed to reach the low latitudes of the Lesser
Antilles (in January, April, and May). Indeed, at the interface
between the two air masses, the trade winds carry a flow of
warm, humid equatorial air, which intensifies convection and
the development of active frontal cloud bands producing heavy
rainfall (Beucher, 2010). The evolution of the number of days
per cluster over the 15 years of TRMM observations showed a
positive correlation, meaning an increase of C4 (p-value < 0.022,
r? = 0.342). This cluster can be associated with CTs 1 to 5 found
in Chadee and Clarke (2015) and WTs 1 to 3, 7, and 8 found in
(Moron et al., 2016).

C5, centred on July-August, was well separated from the dry
season and contained the last third of the daily rainfall analysed.
It represents the cluster of the rainy season with the highest
contribution to the annual rainfall. For C5, unlike C4, the trade
winds were established on a column of atmospheric air, which
was higher and wetter (Fig. 13). At this time of year, the NASH
is moving northeast, which allows the more humid trade winds
to flow to the east Caribbean due to the longer course over the
Atlantic Ocean on its southeast flank. The Atlantic ITCZ reaches
its northern most extent in the Lesser Antilles and begins its
southward migration at this time (Martinez et al., 2019). This
period corresponds to the increase in convection with increased
moisture advection in the Caribbean, which is favourable to
higher daily precipitation (Jury and Malmgren, 2012; Herrera and
Ault, 2017). There was also a significant positive trend (p-value
= 0.028, r? = 0.321) which reflects an increase of C5 between
2000 and 2014 (Fig. 12). C5 can be related to CTs 6-7 and WTs
4—6 found in Chadee and Clarke (2015) and Moron et al. (2016)
respectively. Conflicting trade winds (shear lines), caused in this
period by changes in wind direction and wind speed, passing
from the northeast sector to the southeast sector resulted in heavy
cloud cover and heavy rainfall. In addition, the close passages of
the eastern waves triggered powerful updrafts with large areas
of surface convergence favouring heavier rainfall on the eastern
Antilles (Beucher, 2010).

Among the five retained clusters, C4 and C5 represent 62% of the
sample, and these are the representative clusters of the bi-modal cycle.
The remaining third was divided equally between C1, C2, and C3.
Among the latter, some of the data may represent temporal transitions
between seasons. These transitions may highlight differences between
the northern and southern Caribbean. C2, C4, and C5 showed signifi-
cant trends. The drying trend found for C4 also has been found by other
authors over longer periods and prior to these TRMM observations
(Jury, 2009; Jury and Malmgren, 2012; Jury and Bernard, 2019). The
decrease in the number of C2 days over the last decade, combined with
the increase in the number of C5 days, indicates a potential shift or

even a tightening of the rainy season (Fig. 12). For TRMM daily rainfall
measured during these two periods, the increase in convection at the
beginning and end of summer can be attributed to the oceanic and
continental monsoon annual cycles (Jury and Malmgren, 2012). The
latter has a positive influence on early summer rainfall but negative
influence on late summer rainfall.

3.3.1.2. Links to hurricanes season. In our study regions, hurricanes are
a major concern for resident populations and thus, it was of interest to
analyse the distribution of hurricanes in clusters.

Tropical storms (TS) and hurricanes (H) recorded at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site from 2000 to
2014 helped us to attribute the different proportions of these types
of atmospheric hazards to the clusters retained in KMS-ED. This work
had not been done by Vigaud and Robertson (2017), Moron et al.
(2016), Sdenz and Durdn-Quesada (2015), Jury (2009) and Jury and
Malmgren (2012). The proportions are presented in Table 2. C2, C3,
and C5 contained almost all of these hazards. The highest number of
days with TS or H were found for C5, followed by clusters C2 and C3.
These clusters included around 80% of the H and more than 90% of the
TS. In relation to the size of the clusters, P.,.(H) in Table 2 results show
a proportion twice as large (13%) of H in C2 as that of C5 (5.8%) and
C3 (6.9%). C1 and C4 contained few hazards. However, in the previous
subsection, these clusters have been identified as dry day clusters, but
we did observe the presence of a few TS or H days. This seems to have
been due to the fact that the NOAA database covers the central Atlantic
Ocean and the whole Caribbean region. These phenomena are at the
limit of our domain (Fig. 1).

3.3.2. Local scales: Lesser Antilles of the east Caribbean

In this paragraph we focus on the TRMM rainfall observed over
the mountainous and flat islands of eastern Caribbean. Magnitude
of rainfall across the Caribbean are affected by localised mechanism
like orographic lifting or diurnal heating. They can enhance, to a
lesser extent, convection to produce very different rainfalls between
the windward and leeward parts in these islands (Jury and Bernard,
2019). In Fig. 14, we have calculated the mean cumulative rainfall over
all the meshes (occupying at least 20%) of the land surface, mean of
spatial sum (MSS). The average per pixel of rainfall is represented by
the mean of spatial mean (MSM). We also recorded the percentage of
zeros included in each case (DWR).

These quantitative measures regrouped C1 and C4 (dry days), and
C2 and C5 (rainy days), while C3 remained the intermediate cluster.
The MSM results showed very different orders of magnitude, i.e. 5 to
7.5 mm/day for C2 and C5, 2 to 3.5 mm/day for C3, and 1.04 to 2.07
mm/day for C1 and C4. The MSS values of the islands of Dominica,
Guadeloupe, and Martinique were the highest. Mountain ranges of
these islands are real imposing barriers to the trade winds, which leads
to orographic ascent of the humid air mass and precipitation. C1 and C4
had the highest DWRs on average, respectively between 34 and 60%,
thus reflecting the presence of many days without precipitation in these
clusters. For the flat islands, the values found were generally high but
we believe there was bias due to the low surface area.

The histogram in Fig. 15 compares TRMM to weather stations
observations in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The TRMM data had
overestimated pixels without rain and underestimated high rainfall.
These results were found by Jury and Bernard (2019) for the cloudy
peaks of this region. Biases reported here (e.g. low precipitation) could

be related more to the peculiarities of the micro climate in steep topog-
raphy than to the performance of model physics and data assimilation.
However, it should be noted that rainfall between 8.7 to 16.4 mm/day
is relatively well measured by the TRMM data.

Considering that the class 8.7-16.4 mm/day represents a moderate
rainy day (well detected by TRMM), Fig. 16 shows the intra-annual
(y-axis) frequency distribution for the analysed period (x-axis). The
intra-annual evolution of this class over time showed good agreement
between the local and regional scales. For the dry (C4) and wet (C5)
seasons, the moderate rainfall class was almost evenly distributed with
low frequencies. In the other three clusters, peaks with higher frequen-
cies appeared but the distribution was more scattered (dispersed). From
2002 to 2011 C1, C2, and C3 showed punctually isolated maximums
of moderate rainfall frequencies, which were observed from April to
December. C1 seemed to be the cluster of the April-May inter-season,
with its dry to rainy transition, and C3 appeared to be the cluster of
the reverse transition during November—December.

4. Conclusion and perspectives
4.1. Conclusion

In this study, we used a similarity measure more suitable for the
analysis of climate data for clustering tasks based on the Kullback—
Leibler measure. This involved the design of a new metric, named the
expert distance (ED), in which some knowledge of the meteorologi-
cal structures derived from observational studies was considered, and
we proposed a novel and unique strategy to strengthen the expected
physical relevance. The unit data clustered were the daily rainfall data
obtained by TRMM measurements on either side of the Lesser Antilles
(the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea), and this was conducted to
obtain the clusters of days with similar climate profiles.

We applied unsupervised classification methods (KMS or HAC) to
discover global trends within the clusters. The analysis we performed
by using these two methods encountered the following difficulties.
First, as rainfall totals were widely scattered, ‘‘near” fields in the
sense of L2 were rare; the L2 norm tended to agglomerate fields with
a common spatial structure, although they were otherwise different.

13

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this

Additionally, the centroid used by KMS did not always represent a
realistic physical situation.

Although the L2 norm is frequently used in climate data clustering,
the results obtained herein were unsatisfactory, as the L2 standard
did not effectively quantify the physical similarity between configura-
tions. To better quantify the similarity of the daily rainfall, a spatial
subdivision of fields was used. Once these patches were defined, we
implemented a pseudo-distance based on a relaxation of the precision of
the spatial location of the fields, and we compiled histograms and com-
pared them by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Similar concerns
have already emerged in the field of retrieval image research, and we
developed a subdivision technique suitable to our field corresponding
to known precipitation drivers.

In addition, we used the silhouette index to evaluate the qual-
ity, coherence, and separation distance between the resulting clusters.
We completed this analysis with a visual inspection of the clusters
observed, which confirmed that expert deviation allows us to obtain
improved results than the L2 standard when applied to this type of
meteorological data. Five clusters, resulting from our best algorithm,
were evaluated by experts.

Two main classes accounted for 62% of the daily totals, in almost
similar proportions. For these, the monthly distribution and spatio-
temporal averages were representative of the two predominant seasons
at these latitudes, namely, the dry season and rainy season. These were
focused respectively on the months of February and August-September.
Moreover, the interannual evolution revealed a significant increase
in the number of constituent elements of these two clusters during
the 15 years of measurements. There was a decrease in daily rainfall
(drying), which was spread over the first four months of the year.
Additionally, the rainy season seemed to be earlier as it moved towards
the month of July. The spatio-temporal averages of the daily totals were
5-6 times greater for the mountainous islands.

Our study confirms the trends deduced by other bibliographical
works. It also highlights certain small differences that have remained
unattainable by classical clustering methods. The results obtained led
to finer analysis details of the spatio-temporal dynamics of daily pre-
cipitation. Importantly, the analysed series was short and these results
may evolve in accordance with increases in the observation period and

improvements in the technologies used in the observation of rainfall by
satellites, while remaining subjacent to the evolution of the climate.

The last third of the daily totals was rather representative of the
transitions between the two main seasons. Two of them showed a more
spread out intra-annual distribution of dry days, i.e. 14.8% of the total,
followed by an average decrease in very rainy days in September-
October. These results confirmed the drying trend in this region. With
variable positioning and monthly durations, transitions were generally
very difficult to identify. Only one of the clusters, 10.4% of the total,
was representative of the transition from the rainy to dry season.

The new metric used represents a concrete step forward in the
analysis of possible climatic and seasonal trends based on spatio-
temporal data of daily rainfall. It offers good potential for identifying
the dynamics of transitions, which often herald the possible severity of
the two main seasons.

This study was based on a collaboration between physicists and
computer scientists interested in the methods of data mining from large
databases obtained either from satellite observations or computed as in
the case of meteorological reanalyses.

The extracted clusters, from a climate physicist point of view, were
characterised by relevance, if not originality. However, we believe that
this method adds more finesse and accuracy in the analysis of the fields
for a reasonable number of clusters.

4.2. Perspectives

We presented an approach that should be widely relevant to the
present scope of Climate Informatics, as our observations remain valid
for any application that uses the clustering of fields. However, as our
goal was the extraction of weather types, we focus on these perspectives
in future.

14

At first, we could do the exact same study for other single pa-
rameters, such as the wind or temperature, with the benefit that we
can knowingly compare the quality of the clusters found for each
parameter, utilizing silhouette index. Hence, it is possible to select
the parameters that give better clusters and probably show that some
parameters are irrelevant in the study of weather types in the Lesser
Antilles.

Interestingly, we might, with small adjustments, combine param-
eters to extract clusters of days by relying on a diverse and more
complete information. We can evaluate such data with a couple or
several parameters to obtain potentially better clusters.

Furthermore, some parameters (for example, wind) might explain a
phenomenon (for example, rainfall). Such an analysis is now possible
by clustering the days according to a parameter (wind) and evaluating
the quality of the cluster according to the explained phenomenon
(rainfall). Employing silhouette index, we should be able to select the
best parameter for a given phenomenon.

Computer code availability
