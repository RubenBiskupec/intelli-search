1 Introduction

As Al continues to transform many industries, including the
legal service industry, experts around the work are unani-
mous in predicting exponential growth in AI as a paramount
technology to bring new tools and features to improve legal
services and access to justice. PWC showed in its annual AI
predictions report, legal tech solutions providers will most
surely adapt and adopt existing AI tools and transform them
into tools to help legal businesses to grow. From Al-powered
judges, AI robot lawyers and Al-powered features for con-
tract or team management tools, this trend will continue to
find its use in the day-to-day work of layers and change the
legal sector.

When Professor Richard Susskind wrote the book The
Future of Law in 1996 [1], he predicted that in the future,
lawyers and clients would communicate via e-mail. This pre-
diction was seen as shocking at the time, especially to people
working in the legal profession. However, communications
via e-mail became a reality for lawyers and their clients very
soon after the book was published. This story provides an
insight into the challenges faced in bringing the tradition-
ally conservative legal system into the cutting edge business
environment where AI can thrive.

Professor Susskind recently published a new book titled
“Online Courts and the Future of Justice” [2], where he
argues that technologies like AI are going to bring about
a decade of change in the legal sector and transform the legal
systems as we know it. Although automating our old ways of
working plays a part in this, even more, critical is that artifi-

cial intelligence and technology will help give more improve
individuals access to justice.

The idea is that in the near future people will use the court
system submit evidence and arguments to the judge online
or through some form of electronic communication. Essen-
tially, in this scenario the judgments could move from the
courtroom to online. In a digital society, we should certainly
be able to institute extended courts where we go beyond
decisions made by judges to some kind of diagnostic sys-
tem to guide people regarding their legal options and how to
assemble evidence and provide alternative ways for dispute
resolution.

The future legal system could use AI technology to help
solve disputes without requiring lawyers or the traditional
court system. It is entirely conceivable within a relatively
small number of years that we will have systems that can
predict the outcomes of court decisions based on past deci-
sions by using predictive analytics. Imagine if people had the
option instead of waiting for a court date (and support from
the traditional legal system) to use a machine learning system
to make a prediction about the likely outcome of a case and
then accept that as a binding determination.

Some of the biggest obstacles to developing a legal system
such as this is the lack of multidisciplinary research in this
area, bringing together researchers from social, engineering
and computer sciences together to address the key challenges
posed by our modern society.

Ultimately, technology can help us improve outcomes and
give people a way to resolve public disputes in ways that pre-
viously were not possible. While this transformation might
not solve all the struggles with the legal system or the access-
to-justice issue, it can offer a dramatic improvement enabled
by AI as service.

2 Future trends in Al as a service in law
So far, the emphasis on technology in the legal system has

been to support lawyers and their staff in some of the work
they do, such as e-mail, accounting systems, word processing

and more [3]. Now, we are beginning to see the merits of
using technology to automate some tasks such as document
analysis or document drafting—essentially moving from the
back office to the front office.

Al in legal services has been seen in the recent past as
a method for automating tasks via software to achieve the
same outcome as if a law practitioner had done the work [4].
However, the latest developments in AI have allowed solu-
tions to go way beyond this historical perspective. Today, AI
solutions in the legal services can be grouped into one of the
three areas: document analysis, legal research and practice
automation [5].

The broad category of document analysis includes con-
tract analysis, document review, e-discovery and due dili-
gence [6]. Companies old and new offer Al-powered docu-
ment analytical tools [7]. For example, JPMorgan has used
its proprietary program Contract Intelligence, nicknamed
“COIN,” to decrease its annual contract review time by
360,000 h [8]. Newer companies like Kira Systems, eBre-
via and many others offer time and thus cost-saving benefits
based on their use of AI for due diligence and contract anal-
ysis [9].

AlI-based legal research tools offer a variety of analytical
and predictive capabilities [10]. Many legal research com-
panies have created brief analysis tools that identify relevant
cases not included in an uploaded brief [11]. Some offer
litigation analytical tools that analyze precedent case data
and other data to aid lawyers in predicting case outcomes
[12]. The Supreme People’s Court in China created an AI-
based tool called FaXin to help judges identify precedents
[13]. A company called Intraspexion leverages deep learning
to predict and warn users of their litigation risks [14]. Pre-
dictive analytical company CourtQuant has partnered with
two litigation financing companies to help evaluate litigation
funding opportunities using AI [15]. Intellectual property
lawyers can use Al-based software from companies like
TrademarkNow and Anaqua to perform IP research, brand
protection and risk assessment [16].

The practice automation category refers to the use of
AI solutions to perform tasks ranging from document
automation to e-billing management [17]. Neota Logic’s
PerfectNDA tool leverages the company’s AI platform to
streamline the process of creating non-disclosure agreements
[18]. LegalMation uses AI to automate generation of various
litigation-related documents such as pleadings and discovery
requests. WeVorce and Hello Divorce automate divorce-
related processes via AI [19]. Allstate uses AI to automate
claim summary generation [20]. In the UK, Keoghs has cre-
ated multiple Al-powered systems that automate litigation for
personal injury claims [21]. In patent prosecution, Specifio’s
Al-based software automatically drafts a first-draft patent
application from a user-provided set of claims. CLOEM

S.U.S.A. generates variants of input claims to help patent
drafters properly define the scope of their invention [22].
As shown by these three categories, AI could intro-
duce improved efficiencies and cost savings to legal service
delivery. The lower-cost services enabled by the use of AI
could even increase access to legal services [23]. Ultimately,
researchers at Deloitte, McKinsey and elsewhere predict that
automation technologies like AI could someday automate
significant portions of legal jobs and improve legal service
delivery and became valuable assets for their firms.
Nevertheless, despite all the latest AI developments in
relation to legal services, there are a number of interesting
areas of future development and potential fruitful research.

3 Future areas for research

The development and use of AI for the provision of legal
services is limited with regard to three main aspects, namely
(1) data; (2) algorithms; and (3) implementation.

Data are a critical part of AI systems as both training
material for developing AI algorithms and input material for
the actual use of AI. The development and use of AI algo-
rithms in the provision of legal services is limited by a lack
of easily accessible and analyzable datasets [24]. The say-
ing goes that most law firms are “document rich and data
poor’ and public data such as judicial decisions and opin-
ions are either not available or so varied in format as to be
difficult to use effectively [25]. Furthermore, poor quality
or flawed datasets can cause AI systems to output-biased
results [26] Datasets may have poor quality or flaws for a
variety of reasons. For example, the data may exhibit human
bias, such as recruiters’ gender discrimination of job candi-
dates. Data collection or preparation techniques may result in
statistical biases in the dataset such as unrepresentative sam-
ples (selection bias) [27]. Datasets may even be intentionally
manipulated or corrupted to yield discriminatory analyses
[28]. Beyond data quality issues, significant data privacy and
cybersecurity concerns also arise with the use of massive
quantities of data by AI systems [29].

Algorithmic limitations also impact the use of AI in the
legal industry. As mentioned in the above examples, all AI
systems currently available perform only very specific set of
tasks. AI works best when there are clear data patterns and
definitive answers; it performs poorly when applied to the
abstract or open-ended situations requiring judgment, such
as the situations that lawyers often operate in [30]. In these
circumstances, human expertise and intelligence are still crit-
ical to the development and the available AI solutions still
not sophisticated enough to understand and adapt to nuances
and to respond to expectations and layered meaning, and
comprehend the practicalities of human experience. Thus,
Service Oriented Computing and Applications (2020) 14:223-226

AI still a long way from completely replace people in the
legal profession.

There are many concerns that AI algorithms are inherently
limited in their accuracy, reliability and impartiality [31].
These limitations may be the direct result of biased data, but
they may also stem from how the algorithms are created. Fur-
ther research is necessary on programmers’ decision-making
processes and methodologies when coding and training an
AI algorithm [32]. For example, how software engineers
choose a set of variables to include in an algorithm, deciding
how to use variables, whether to maximize profit margins or
maximize loan repayments, can lead to a biased algorithm
[33]. Programmers may also struggle to understand how an
AI algorithm generates its outputs—the algorithm may be
unpredictable, thus validating “correctness” or accuracy of
those outputs when piloting a new AI system may be chal-
lenging. But some researchers argue that limited accuracy is
sometimes ““good enough’ for particular tasks” or that algo-
rithms can be useful despite their imperfections. Research on
the types of AI for particular use cases and perhaps a spe-
cific methodology for the creation of algorithms for solution
development in particular scenarios would be invaluable in
fostering confidence and increasing adoption of AI services
in the legal industry [34].

The use of AI is further limited by challenges arising dur-
ing an organization’s AI implementation process and this
aspect could also benefit from further research focus. Firstly,
understanding the business model impact of AI solutions
in this particular sector which have many business models
based on hours billed, such as those commonly used by law
firms, may not incentivize the efficiency improvements that
AI systems can provide [35]. Secondly, effective deploy-
ment of AI requires a clearly defined use case and work
process, strong technical expertise, extensive personnel and
algorithm training, well-executed change management pro-
cesses, an appetite for change and a willingness to work with
the new technologies. Potential AI users should recognize
that effectively deploying the technology may be harder than
they would expect. Indeed, the greatest challenge may be
simply getting potential users to understand and to trust the
technology, not necessarily deploying it [36].

Introducing these AI systems as services, however, could
narrow the gap between the users’ trust and technology
deployment. These AI services with rich function descrip-
tions, explicitly defined inputs and expected outputs can be
flexibly and easily orchestrated with no or little coding to
increase the efficiency in system prototyping and implement-
ing for the users to simulate and test different scenarios which
could build users’ confidences.

4 Conclusion

The intersection of AI and law has been a topic of research
and discussion for at least fifty years. But the development
and deployment of AI are accelerating. Future research in
this area must be multidisciplinary and representative of the
key challenges which will be faced in the deployment of AI
solutions as services to improve the legal practice. Perhaps
the next decade will be as life changing to legal profession-
als and to society as users of legal systems. Despite AI’s
limitations, and perhaps because of them, lawyers should
consider how the rise of AI will impact their profession and
their ethics in the years to come. Legal professionals gener-
ally should explore how they might leverage the opportunity
now to improve legal service delivery via new processes and
technology and contribute to the development of AI-based
services while ensuring the ethical development of AI solu-
tions in this area.
