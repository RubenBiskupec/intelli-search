1. INTRODUCTION

In a distribution system, power quality has attracted researchers and operators' attention due to the
increment of the power electronic equipment and the non-linear load utilization [1]. The power quality issues
such as voltage sag and voltage swell affect the performance of the consumer sensitive equipment. Thus, it is
necessary to improve the quality of the power delivered to the user. In practice, there are various methods
reported to improve the power quality in the distribution network. One of the solutions is the utilization of the
dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) to mitigate the harmonics and compensate for the voltage sag and swell
during power system operation [2-4]. The DVR is utilized by controlling the voltage source connected in
series between the loads and the grid. It is used to regulate any disturbances that affect sensitive loads [5-7].
In the literature, there are several types of DVR controllers reported, such as feed-forward and feedback [8],
fuzzy and adaptive proportional-integral-fuzzy controllers [9].

Sliding mode control (SMC) is a control method used with the DVR to regulate the voltage supplied
to the three-phase load. SMC is preferred in various nonlinear control applications due to its fast response,
easier to implement, and robust with the variation of the system parameters. In the literature, the SMC for the

DVR application is reported in [10]. The method uses 12-switch, 3-phase voltage source converter to provide
the required compensation following a voltage disturbance. Next, a multilevel SMC combines a three-phase
inverter and three single-phase inverters to inject the voltage compensation to the system [11]. The power
converters are controlled by the SMC. On the other hand, the SMC controls a single-phase DVR by tuning
the parameters of the controller [12]. In [13], the SMC is utilized with the DVR to address the issue of
voltage sag in the system, specifically. The particle swarm optimization technique is utilized in [14] to
estimate the optimum parameters of the SMC to mitigate the THD of the voltage. The SMC utilized in this
report is based on the synchronous reference frame to obtain the DVR reference voltage. The majority of the
SMC reported in the literature is based on a variant of a linear sliding variable with a linear differentiator to
obtain the derivative of the error function. Although it has shown satisfactory performance in the various
report, its application is limited to the presence of noise the measured input signal, which is inevitable
in practice.

This paper presents a robust SMC technique for DVR to address the limitation of the linear
controller. The method is based on the approximate classical sliding mode differentiator (ACSMD) with the
nonlinear sliding variable (NSV). In this paper, the sigmoid function is used to define the appropriate control
response based on the input to mitigate the voltage disturbance that occurred in the system. The proposed
method is robust against the presence of noise in the measured input signal. Consequently, this allows the
DVR to maintain the voltage magnitude at the constant value, minimize the steady-state error bound, and
reduce the total harmonic distortion of the system. Following this introductory section, the proposed
methodology of the ACSMD with NSV is discussed in Section 2. This section elaborates on the ACSMD in
detail, the selection of the NSV method, the description of the test system model, and the performance
indicator utilized in this study. Next, the proposed methodology is applied, and the results are analyzed in
Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes the work presented in this paper.

2. METHODOLOGY

This section discusses the methodology proposed in this study. The section starts with the
elaboration of the ACSMD technique, followed by the selection of the NSV approach. Then, the test system
model and the performance evaluation measurement are discussed.

2.1 Approximate classical sliding mode differentiator (ACSMD)
The ASCMD works by estimating the error signal e as in (1).

e=xt+o (1)

From the equation, e is the error in the input signal, x is the observer dynamic, o is the observer
sliding variable, respectively. The observer dynamic x is obtained form its derivative function formulated in
(2). In (2), the gain k and f are the sliding mode differentiator gain, respectively. The gain k and f are
selected to force o goes to zero as k > |é|. Consequently, let the estimation of é become the output of the
following low pass filter (LPF) as in (3).

x= ~= + tan"1(fo) (2)
TU+V= - « tan-l(fo) (3)

From (3), T is a time constant of the low pass filter (LPF), and v is the LPF output, respectively.
Eventually, the derivative of the LPF output is represented as in (4). The derivative of the LPF output is the
output of the ACSMD method [15].

v= ~(—v + - « tan-1(fa)) (4)

The selection of the time constant of the LPF and the gain f are very critical to the performance of
the ACSMD technique. In this study, these parameters are set based on the study reported in [15]. These

rae 2
parameters should be selected such that (4) is minimized. Therefore, these two parameters are set such that 7

is as small as possible. In this study, T is set to 0.01, and f is set to 100, respectively. In addition, tT should be
set small enough to eliminate the high-frequency term in the input error signal.

2.2 Sliding variable approach
2.2.1. Linear PID sliding variable

The proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller has been utilized in the various control
application in practice. Over 90% of the industrial processes utilize PID in their daily operation [16, 17] due
to its robustness, ease of maintenance, and simplicity [18, 19]. The PID controller consists of proportional,
integral, and derivative gains that scale the value of error ¢ between the input and output of the controller.
In the sliding variable technique, the sliding variable Sjineg- based on the PID controller is
represented using (5).

de(t)
dt

Serror — Kpe(t) + Ky i e(t)dt + Kp (5)

In (5), Kp, Kj, and Kp represent the proportional, integral, and derivative gains, respectively.

2.2.2. Nonlinear sliding variable
In the following items, the nonlinear sliding variables are proposed. The sliding variable will contain
a nonlinear term which it functions to the error signal.

S(e) =e +Af(e) (6)

Where S(e) is the linear sliding variable, é is the linear derivative of the error, A is the sliding
variable parameters, f(e) is a linear function of e. The sliding variable becomes linear. In the actual
situation, S(e) is not equal to zero in the sliding mode. Instead, S(e) will be highly oscillated and bounded
signals. In the following subsections, the nonlinear sliding variable is suggested where f(e) is a nonlinear
function of the e. In addition, the robustness will be tested. This will show the superiority of the nonlinear
against the linear sliding variable. Equation (7) represents a mathematical function that has a sigmoid curve
or S-shaped characteristic of the curve. The logistic function shown below is the standard below choice for a
sigmoid function [20].

x

S(x) =—== =

1+e-* 1+e*

 

(7)

Where S(x) is the sliding variable of the function x, from the information above, the sigmoid
function is monotonic and have the first derivative as bell-shaped, it is constrained by a pair of horizontal
asymptotes as x— + oo, It is convex for values is less than 0, and it is concave for values more than 0. For
these specifications, sigmoid function and its affine compositions can possess multiple optima.

f (x) = arctanx (8)

In the present work, the arctan function is used in the construction of the sliding variable.
Accordingly, the sliding variable becomes;

S(e) =é+A* tan l(a *e) (9)

In this equation. S(e) is the sliding variable, a, and A are the sliding variable parameters, and e is the
input error signal. As in the previous two cases of the sliding variable, the ultimate bound on the error e can
be estimated via Lyapunov function as follows;

V ={-A*tan-!(a *e) +S} * sign(e) < —A* tan-1(a * le]) +p (10)

Where V is the derivative of Lyapunov function, sign(e) is the signal function, and p is a positive
constant, the ultimate bound on the error e(t) is determined as;

1 p
le(t)| > <tan(2),ast > (11)

From the above inequality, the ultimate bound on e can be adjusted to a suitable value via a proper
selection of the design parameters A and a.

3. APPLICATIONS, RESULTS, AND DISCUSSIONS
3.1. The modeling of system and simulation

The proposed system of the DVR is investigated by using MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the
disturbances when it occurs in a distribution system. The disturbances considered in this study are balanced
sag, unbalanced sag, balanced swell, and unbalanced swell. The parameters of the test system model are
obtained in [23]. Figure 1 represents the system under study. The system consists of an AC source that feeds
the two feeders through a three-winding transformer. Each feeder connected to a winding transformer to
supply the required power to different types of loads. The DVR connected in series with the second feeders
to mitigate the voltage disturbance occurred in the system by injecting a required voltage.

3.1.1. Case 1: Balanced three-phase voltage sag

A balanced voltage sag is applied to the system by overloading the load at t=0.1s until t=0.15s.
Then, the induction motor in the system is overloaded at t=0.185s until t=0.2s. Consequently, the voltage
amplitude is reduced in all three phases, as depicted in Figure 2(a). In the figure, the voltage is reduced from
the nominal voltage to 0.7096 pu and 0.612 pu for the two operating situations, respectively. Consequently,
the DVR senses this disturbance and injects a required voltage magnitude as shown in Figure 2(b). As a
result, the voltage amplitude at the load side increases, as shown in Figure 2(c). Following the compensation,
the voltage increases to 0.999pu, 0.9992pu, and 0.9992pu in Phase A, B, and C, respectively. In addition, the
total harmonic distortion (THD) at the load voltage before compensation is 8.79. The THD improves to 1.41
following the compensation of the proposed DVR technique. The result discusses in this study corroborated
with the result reported in [24].

3.1.2. Case 2: Unbalanced voltage sag

In this study, the load is overloaded at t=0.2s until t=0.3s. Only phase C is applied to simulate the
unbalanced voltage sag condition. Following this disturbance, the voltage amplitude is reduced to 0.4996pu,
0.8992pu, and 0.9007pu in Phase A, B, and C, respectively, as shown in Figure 3 (a). Then, the DVR detects
the voltage sag and rapidly inject a proper magnitude to regulate the voltage at the load side as in Figure 3
(b). Consequently, the voltage amplitude at all three phases is restored to 0.9993pu, 0.9993pu, 1.0000pu in
Phase A, B, and C, respectively. Figure 3(c) shows the compensated voltage of this case study. Additionally,
the THD at the load improves from 15.78, before the compensation, to 1.71 after the compensation using the
proposed DVR.

3.1.3. Case 3: Balance three-phase voltage swell

In this case study, the load is suddenly turned-off to simulate the voltage swell disturbance in the
system. The voltage swell occurs at t=0.1s until t=0.2s. Figure 4(a) shows the voltage swell that occurred in
the system. The figure shows that the voltage increases from the nominal voltage to 1.398pu in all phases.
Following this voltage swelling, the DVR sense this difference and inject a required voltage magnitude.
Figure 4(b) shows the phase voltage injected by the proposed DVR to compensate for the load voltage
difference. Figure 4(c) represents the voltage amplitude at the load side after compensation. The result
indicates the voltage at all phases improves to 0.9998pu. Moreover, the THD at the load bus before the
compensation is 10.85. The compensation by the proposed DVR improves the THD to 0.87.

3.1.4. Case 4: Unbalanced voltage swell

This case considers an unbalanced voltage swell occurred at t=0.2s until t=0.3s. In this operating
situation, the voltage at Phase A, B, and C increases to 1.408pu, 1.146pu, and 1.124pu, respectively. This
result is observed in Figure 5(a). Subsequently, the DVR detects the disturbance and injects a required
voltage magnitude to mitigate the voltage disturbance, as shown in Figure 5(b). Figure 5(c) shows the load
voltage following the compensation using the proposed DVR. In the figure, the load voltage in Phase A, B,
and C increases to 0.9998pu, 1 .0000pu, 0.9994 pu, respectively. Plus, the THD at the load bus improves from
11.10 to 0.85 after the compensation.

4. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this paper reports a DVR controller method using the ACSMD with the Arctan
method. The results show that the proposed method is able to compensate for the voltage in the test system
model under the balanced voltage sag, unbalanced voltage sag, balanced voltage swell, and unbalanced
voltage swell. Following the compensation, the THD at the load bus is also improved. The comparison

indicates that the proposed method shows a better performance in terms of ITAE as compared to the method
reported in the literature. This implies that the ACSMD with the Arctan method is able to compensate the
voltage under various voltage disturbances better as compared to the method discussed in this paper.
