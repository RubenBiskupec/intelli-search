available at the end of the article capture users’ learning and behavior (e.g., passive video watching). In this paper, we
present a study with 40 students who watched a MOOC lecture while their eye-
movements were being recorded. We then proposed a method to define stimuli-
based gaze variables that can be used for any kind of stimulus. The proposed
stimuli-based gaze variables indicate students’ content-coverage (in space and time)
and reading processes (area of interest based variables) and attention (i.e., with-me-
ness), at the perceptual (following teacher's deictic acts) and conceptual levels
(following teacher discourse). In our experiment, we identified a significant mediation
effect of the content coverage, reading patterns and the two levels of with-me-ness
on the relation between students’ motivation and their learning performance. Such
variables enable common measurements for the different kind of stimuli present in
distinct MOOCs. Our long-term goal is to create student profiles based on their
performance and learning strategy using stimuli-based gaze variables and to provide
students gaze-aware feedback to improve overall learning process. One key
ingredient in the process of achieving a high level of adaptation in providing gaze-
aware feedback to the students is to use Artificial Intelligence (Al) algorithms for
prediction of student performance from their behaviour. In this contribution, we also
present a method combining state-of-the-art Al technique with the eye-tracking data
to predict student performance. The results show that the student performance can
be predicted with an error of less than 5%.

Introduction

We present a study to investigate how well stimuli-based gaze analytics can be utilized
to enhance motivation and learning in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Our
work seeks to provide insights on how gaze variables can provide students with gaze-
aware feedback and help us improve the design, interfaces and analytics used as well as
provide a first step towards gaze-aware design of MOOCs to amplify learning.

The evidence for understanding and supporting users’ learning is still very limited,
considering the wide range of data produced when the learner interacts with a system
(e.g., gaze Prieto, Sharma, Dillenbourg, & Jesus, 2016). Devices like eye-trackers have
become readily available and have the capacity to provide researchers with unprece-
dented access to users’ attention Sharma, Jermann, & Dillenbourg, 2014). Thus, besides
commonly used variables coming from users’ click-streams, keywords and preferences,
we can also use eye-tracking variables to accurately measure students’ attention during
their interaction with learning materials (e.g., MOOC lectures).

A multitude of factors affect academic performance of the students: previous grades
(Astin, 1971), students’ efforts and motivation (Grabe & Latta, 1981), socioeconomic
differences (Kaplan, 1982), quality of schooling (Wiley, 1976), attention (Good & Beck-
erman, 1978) and participation (Finn, 1989). In this contribution, we address the gen-
eral question of how gaze-variables (related to students’ reading and attention) can help
students to watch MOOC videos more efficiently? We tackle this question from a
teacher’s perspective (how much student follows the teacher) and call it this gaze-based
measure “with-me-ness”. With-me-ness is defined in two levels: (1) perceptual (follow-
ing teacher’s deictic acts) and (2) conceptual (following teacher discourse). Specifically,

in this contribution, we address the following two questions:

1. How eye-tracking behaviour mediates the relationship between students’ mo-
tivation and learning within a MOOC?.
2. How well we can predict the learning gain and motivation from the eye-

tracking data in its most basic form?

In order to answer these questions, we define variables using the stimulus (video lec-
ture) presented to the students. These variables are defined using information from the
stimulus with the different levels of details. Once, we have the variables, we perform
mediation analysis to answer the first questions. To answer the second question, we
utilize one of the most basic eye-tracking visualisations, “Heat-maps” (Spakov & Minio-
tas, 2007) to extract features and use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to

predict the students’ learning gains.

Video based learning
The use of educational videos has been widely employed in the past years. Educational
videos is a vital element in several online learning forms (in a MOOC, or how-to video
tutorial), students spend enormous amount of time watching various forms of educa-
tional videos (Seaton, Bergner, Chuang, Mitros, & Pritchard, 2014). Educational videos
have been studied extensively during the last decades, through the lenses of empirical
studies and theories (Giannakos, 2013). One of the most commonly acceptes theoretical
angles it the one of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML, Mayer &
Moreno, 2003), CTML provides several insights on how video-based learning (and
multimedia in general) can be used effectively.

Paivio (2013) argued that information provided by both auditory and visual channels
should increase recall and retention. Studies by Mayer and Moreno (2003) have shown
Sharma et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:13 Page 3 of 19

that visual information helps to process and remember verbal information and vice
versa. This argument was strengthened by cue-summation theory showing that learning
performance in the combined audio and pictures was better than in the combined
audio and text, if the numbers of available cues or stimuli are increased (Severin, 1967).
The major benefits of video as a facilitator of educational content include presentation
of detailed information (with text and image), efficient engagement of students’ atten-
tion, simulating discussions and providing concrete real life examples with visualiza-
tions (Schwartz & Hartman, 2007).

During the last year, video-based learning practices are applied in a variety of ways,
such as the flipped classroom, small private online courses (SPOCs), and xMOOCs.
Today, advanced video repository systems have seen enormous growth (e.g. Khan
Academy, PBS Teachers, Moma’s Modern Teachers, Lynda) through social software
tools and the possibilities to enhance videos on them (Giannakos, 2013).

Existing research on video-based learning involves many features of today’s MOOCs
lectures. Volery and Lord (2000) identified 3 success factors in online education: usable
and interactive technology design, instructors’ enthusiasm and interest in the tool and
students’ exposure to the web. Tobagi (1995) developed an online distant learning sys-
tem to capture lectures real time, compress them, store them on an on-demand system
and transmit the videos to internal server. The on-demand video system server elimi-
nated distance limitations and provided time independent access to study material.

Tobagi (1995) compared different modalities of video lectures (interactive video, in-
structional television and television) and preconceptions of difficulty for different modal-
ities and found that there was no significant difference in the learning outcome but there
was a significant difference in the level of preconceived difficulty in television and inter-
active videos. Cennamo, Savenye, and Smith (1991) studied the effect of video based in-
struction on students problem solving skills and attitude towards mathematics and
instruction and concluded that there was a significant improvement after the treatment in
students problem solving and mathematical skills as well as the instructional attitude.

Choi and Johnson (2005) compared learning outcome and learners motivation (atten-
tion, relevance, confidence, satisfaction) in video based learning to traditional textual-
instruction based learning and found no difference in learning outcome for the two
conditions. However, the students wore more attentive in video based learning condi-
tion that the textual-instruction condition.

Video lectures have several affordances besides those relying to traditional fast-forward
and rewind interactions. Innovative features, such as slide-video separation, social
categorization and navigation, and advanced search, have also been used recently in video
learning platforms (Giannakos, Chorianopoulos, & Chrisochoides, 2015). All this amount
of interactions can be converted via analytics into useful information that can be used to
support learning (Kim et al., 2014). As the number of learners and the diversity of col-
lected data grows, our ability to capture richer and more authentic learning patterns
grows as well, allowing us to create new affordances that amplify our learning capacity.

Eye-tracking and education
Utilizing representative and accurate data allows us to better understand students and
design meaningful experiences for them. Eye tracking has been employed to understand
Sharma et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:13 Page 4 of 19

the learning processes and different levels of outcome in a multitude of learning scenar-
ios. Prieto et al. (2016), used eye-tracking data to explain the cognitive load that the
teachers experience during different classes and various scenarios. These scenarios in-
clude different factors such as experience of the teacher, size of the class, presence of a
new technology and presence of a teaching assistant. The results show that the eye-
tracking data is an important source of information explaining different factors in
teachers’ orchestration load and experience.

Eye-tracking has also been used in online learning for both in individual (Kizilcec, Papa-
dopoulos, & Sritanyaratana, 2014) and collaborative (Sharma, Caballero, Verma, Jermann,
& Dillenbourg, 2015a, b) settings. Sharma et al. (2014) focus on capturing the attention of
the individual learners in a video-based instructional setting to find the underlying mecha-
nisms for positive learning outcome; Sharma et al. (2015a, b) also focus on joint attention
in remote collaborative learning scenarios to predict the learning outcome.

In general, eye-tracking allows us to generate rich information, but it can be challen-
ging to identify what information is processed and retained based on human’s gaze.
The eye-mind hypothesis (Just & Carpenter, 1980) proposes that there is a connection
between people gaze and attention, if people process the information that they visually
attend to. In this contribution, we utilize eye-tracking to measure students’ attention
and then address how students’ attention (i.e., “with-me-ne”) has the capacity to medi-

ate the relationship between students’ motivation and learning within a MOOC video.

Methodology

Participants and procedure

A total of 40 university students (12 females) from a major European university partici-
pated in the experiment. The only criterion for selecting the participant was that each
participant took the introductory Java course in the previous semester. This is also a
prerequisite for taking the Functional Programming in Scala course at the university
campus. The participants watched two MOOC videos from the course “Functional Pro-
gramming Principles in Scala” and answered programming questions after each video.

Upon their arrival in the experiment site the participants signed a consent form and an-
swered the study processes questionnaire (SPQ, Biggs, Kember, & Leung, 2001). Then
watched the two MOOC videos and answered the quiz based on what they were taught in
the videos. During their interaction with the MOOC videos their gaze was recorded, using
SMI RED 250 eye-trackers.

Some of the reasons why 40 students are sufficient in our study are: (i) the data col-
lected are “big” in terms of the 4Vs’ (volume, variety, veracity, velocity). For example, eye-
tracking data collected at a high frequency (e.g.,250 Hz in the present study) means that
we have a continuous and unobtrusive measurement of the behaviour of the users. Col-
lecting this kind of data results into continuously and massively gathering a few Gigabytes
of data per person (Volume and Velocity). Furthermore, collecting data in the form of
multiple datatypes at once (i.e., fixations, saccades, heatmaps, scanpaths, clickstream) sat-
isfies Variety, whereas, previous research has acknowledged those data for cognitive load,
attention, anticipation, fatigue, information process (Veracity); (ii) the current cost of the
equipment necessary to collect those data does not allow for simultaneous use of multiple
eye-trackers, but the granularity of information we can have access to, justifies their usage.
Sharma et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:13 Page 5 of 19

Based on these reasons it is safe to say that 40 participants are indeed enough to arrive at
the conclusions that our paper is deriving with the present study.

Moreover, in recent eye-tracking research we see similar sizes of the population used.
For example, in two recent systematic reviews (Alemdag & Cagiltay, 2018; Ashraf et al.,
2018) with a combined 85 different eye-tracking studies the majority (84.71%) of the
studies had between 8 and 60 participants. The papers cited in this contribution with
eye-tracking research also have the number of participants between 10 and 40 partici-
pants (except the collaborative studies where the researchers had 28 to 40 pairs).

Measures

The measures used in our study were: content coverage, scanpath (a combination of
the fixations and saccades in the order of appearances) based variables, students/
teacher co-attention (i.e., with-me-ness) coming from eye-tracking, students’ motivation
coming from SPQ and students learning (coming from the final test).

The eye-tracking variables are defined using the semantics of the stimulus, that is the
video lecture in our case. We define eye-tracking variables at four levels (see Table 1).
First, the content coverage has no semantics from the video. Second, the scanpath
based variables required us to define areas of interest on the video. Third, the percep-
tual with-me-ness was computed using the areas of interest and the pointing gestures
of the teacher. Finally, the conceptual with-me-ness was defined using the areas of

interest definitions and the dialogue of the teacher.

Content coverage

Content coverage is computed using the heat-maps (for details on heat-maps see
Holmgvist et al. 2011) of the participants. We divided the MOOC lecture in slices of
10s each and computed the heat-maps for each participant. Following are the steps to

compute attention points from the heat-maps:

1. Subtract the image without heat-map (Fig. 1b) from the image that has the heat-
map (Fig. 1a).
Apply connected components on the resulting image (Fig. 1c)

3. The resulting image with connected components identified (Fig. 1d) gives the
attention points.

4. The combined area of attention points in a given time window represents the
content coverage of that time window.

Attention points typically represented the different areas where the students focused
their attention. The number of the attention points would depict the number of atten-
tion zones and the area of the attention points (Content Coverage) would depict the
total time spent on a particular zone. We used the area covered by attention points per
10s to check for the mediation effect on the relationship across the levels of perform-
ance and learning motivation. The area covered by the attention points typically indi-
cated the content coverage for students. The content coverage indicates the content

read by the students and the time spent on the content.

Scanpath based variables

AOI misses An area of interest (AOI) was said to be missed by a participant who did
not look at that particular AOI at all during the period the AOI was present on the
screen. In terms of learning behaviour AOI misses would translate to completely ignor-
ing some parts of the slides. We counted the number of such AOls per slide in the
MOOC video as a scan-path variable and compare the number of misses per slide
across the levels of performance and learning strategy (for details on areas of interest
see Holmavist et al. 2011).

AOI backtracks A back-track was defined as a saccade that went to the AOI which is
not in the usual forward reading direction and had already been visited by the student.
For example, in the Fig. 2, if a saccade goes from AOI3 to AOI2 it would be counted as
a back-track. AOI back-tracks would represent rereading behaviour while learning from
the MOOC video. The notion of term rereading in the present study was slightly differ-
ent than what is used in existing research (for example, Millis and King (2001), Dow-
hower (1987) and Paris and Jacobs (1984)). The difference comes from the fact that in
the present study the students did not reread the slides completely but they can refer
to the previously seen content on the slide until the slide was visible. We counted the
number of back-tracks per slide in the MOOC video as a scan-path variable and

With-me-ness

With-me-ness measures how much the student is paying attention to what the teacher
is saying or pointing at (Sharma et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2015a, b). With-me-ness is
defined at two levels of teacher-student interaction: perceptual and conceptual.

Perceptual with-me-ness

Perceptual with-me-ness measures if the student looks at the items referred to by the
teacher through deictic acts (sometimes accompanied by words like, here, this variable
or only by verbal references, like, the counter, the sum). Deictic references are imple-
mented by using two cameras during MOOC recording, one that captures the teacher’s
face and one, above the writing surface, that captures the hand movements. In some
MOOCs, the hand is not visible but teacher uses a digital pen whose traces on the dis-
play (underlining a word, circling an object, adding an arrow) act as a deictic gestures.

The perceptual “With-me-ness” has 3 main components: entry time, first fixation dur-
ation and the number of revisits (Fig. 4). Entry time (Fig. 4 top-right) is the temporal
lag between the times a referring pointer appears on the screen and stops at the re-
ferred site (x,y) and the first time the student’s gaze stops at (x,y). First fixation dur-
ation (Fig. 4 bottom-left) is how long the student gaze stops at the referred site for the
first time. Revisits (Fig. 4 bottom-right) are the number of times the student gaze
comes back to the referred site. The measure of perceptual with-me-ness is an arith-
metic combination of these components (FFD = First Fixation Duration; ET = Entry
Time; NumRV = Number of revisits; RV = Re Visit duration):

NumRV
FFD-ET+ S_ RV;
i=1

Perceptual With_me_ness = = ss—______—_
P Total duration of the deictic reference

The with-me-ness measurement has also been used by Sharma et al. (2014 and
2015a, b) to measure how much time the students spent in following the teacher’s deic-
tics and dialogues. Sharma et al. (2014 and 2015a, b) found this measure to be corre-
lated to the learning gains of the students. We have extended the analyses to include
the student motivation as an independent variable, learning as the dependent variable

and gaze behavior as the mediating variable.

Conceptual with-me-ness

Conceptual with-me-ness is defined by the discourse of the teacher (i-e., to what extend
students look at the object that the teacher is verbally referring to) Fig. 5 provides an
example. Thus, conceptual with-me-ness measures how often a student looks at the

objects verbally referred to by the teacher during the whole course of time (the

complete video). In order to have a consistent measure of conceptual “With-me-ness”
we normalize the time a student looks at the overlapping content by slide duration.

Motivation

We used the motivation scales from the SPQ (Biggs et al., 2001). This is a 5-point
Likert scale questionnaire containing 10 questions (5 for deep and 5 for surface motiv-
ation). Deep motivation is defined as having the intrinsic motivation towards learning,
while the surface motivation is defined as fear of failing in the tests ((Biggs et al.,
2001)). In this study we used the mean motivation (mean of deep and surface) that has
an average value of 2.10 (Std. Dev. = 1.20).

Learning

At the end of the videos the students took a test about the content they were taught in
the two videos. The score from this test was considered to be the learning performance
in this paper. After this point, we would refer to this as learning. The mean learning
value was 6.9 out of 10 (Std. Dev. = 1.6). For the test, the instructor of the MOOC
helped the authors to create the multiple-choice quiz for the two videos. This quiz was
similar to the one used in the MOOC running at Coursera platform.

Data analysis

Mediation analysis

To identify how “with-me-ness” (measured by eye-tracking) mediates the relationship
between students’ motivation (measured by the questionnaire) and learning (measured
by the post quiz) within a MOOC we employ mediation analysis proposed by Baron
and Kenny (1986). In our analysis, we used motivation as the predictor, learning as the
outcome and gaze behaviour as the mediating variables. Figure 6 shows the schematic
representation of the model.

To examine with-me-ness capacity to mediate the relationship between motivation
and learning we followed Baron and Kenny (1986) three steps process: a) the predictor
(i.e., motivation) must significantly influence the mediator (i.e., with-me-ness); b) the
predictor (i.e., motivation) must significantly influence the outcome (i.e., learning); c)
both predictor and mediator are employed to predict the outcome: if both of them sig-
nificantly affect the dependent variable, then this mediator partially mediates the im-
pact of the predictor independent variable on the outcome; if the influence of mediator
is significant but the influence of predictor is not, then mediator fully mediates the im-
pact of predictor on outcome.

Learning outcome and motivation prediction: feature extraction

For predicting the learning outcome from the behaviour data, we used the heat-maps
and a pretrained deep neural network to generate the features. Figure 7 shows the basic
working pipeline to extract the features from the heatmap image to the basic feature
vector. Following are the steps to extract features from the eye-tracking data and the

video lecture.

1. Overlay the eye-tracking data on the video to create the heatmap.

2. Create the heatmap image from every presentation slide in the video lecture (this
step resulted into 15 heatmap image per participant).

3. Use the pretrained VGG-19 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) deep neural network
architecture to extract the 1000 features per image.

4. Use a non-overlapping and sliding window of size 10 to reduce the number of fea-
tures to 100.

Feature selection for learning outcome and motivation prediction: least absolute shrinkage
selection operator

To select the most important features we employ the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Se-
lection Operator (LASSO, Tibshirani, 1996). LASSO is an extension of Ordinary Least

Square (OLS) regression techniques fit for the cases where the number of examples is

less than the length of the feature vector (Tibshirani, 1996). To find the best fitting
curve for a set of data points, OLS tries to minimize the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)
which is the difference between the actual values of the dependent variable y and the
fitted values y. The formulation of the OLS is given as follows:

¥Y =a +f,%1 + fot. +... + Bn

The objective of the OLS regression is to minimize the difference between S~ (j-y)”
with the constraint that }~ 8; <s. Where s is called the shrinkage factor. LASSO on the
other hand performs similar optimization with the slight difference in the constraint,
which is now ¥ | f; | <s. While using LASSO, some of the ; will be zero. Choosing s
is like choosing the number of predictors in a regression model. Cross-validation can
be used to estimate the best suited value for s. Here, we used a 10-fold cross-validation

to select the appropriate value of s.

Learning outcome and motivation prediction and prediction evaluation

In order to predict the learning outcome of the students, we used several prediction al-
gorithms. These algorithms include Gaussian process models (Rasmussen, 2003) with
linear and polynomial kernels, Support Vector machines (SVM, Scholkopf & Smola,
2001) also with linear and polynomial kernels, Random forest (Liaw & Wiener, 2002),
Generalised Additive Models (GAM, Hastie (1993) and Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990).
The main reason for using these particular algorithms is that these are designed to han-
dle datasets that have high frequency for fewer examples.

We divided the whole dataset into training (80%, 32 students) and testing (20%, 8 stu-
dents). For removing the selection bias from the training set, we performed a 5-fold
cross-validation. The results reported are the average error rate for all the cross-
validation iterations.

For evaluating our prediction results, we are using the Normalized Root Mean Squared
Error (NRMSE). NRMSE is the proposed metric for student models (Pelanek, 2015), and
is used in most of the articles in learning technology (Moreno-Marcos, Alario-Hoyos,

Mufioz-Merino, & Kloos, 2018) for measuring the accuracy of learning prediction.

Results

To answer the first research question about the mediation effect of the gaze behaviour
on the relation between learning and motivation, we will present the mediation analyses
with content coverage, scanpath variables and with-me-ness. Further, to answer the
second research question about the predicting ability of simplistic gaze variables, we

will present the prediction results for both the students’ motivation and their learning.

Content coverage

To examine the mediation effect of content coverage we tested the model shown in
Fig. 8. As shown in Table 2, the direct link between motivation and both variables of
content coverage was significant and hence satisfied the first condition. The link be-
tween motivation and learning was also significant and hence satisfied the second con-
dition as well. Moreover, the direct relationship between motivation with learning was

not significant when content coverage variable were added. In Table 2 we present the
results of the mediation analyses (row one for content coverage).

We observe that learning can be significantly predicted by motivation and that con-
tent coverage can be predicted by motivation. Finally, there is a significant prediction
of learning by motivation and content coverage, however the coefficient of motivation
is not significant anymore. Thus we can conclude that the content coverage fully medi-
ates the relation between motivation and learning. The positive correlation between the
motivation and learning is higher for the students with the higher content coverage
than the positive correlation between motivation and learning for the students with the
lower content coverage. It is clear from Fig. 8 that the students with high motivation
have higher chances of getting a high score if they have high content coverage than the

students with lower motivation.

Scanpath variables
To examine the mediation effect of scanpath variables we tested the model shown in Fig. 9
with both the AOI misses and the AOI backtracks of scanpath variables. As shown in
Table 2, the direct link between motivation and both scanpath variables was significant
and hence satisfied the first condition. The link between motivation and learning was also
significant and hence satisfied the second condition as well. However, the direct relation-
ship between motivation with learning was still significant when scanpath variables (mis-
ses and backtracks) were added. In Table 2 we present the results of the two mediation
analyses (row two for AOI misses and row three for AOI backtracks).

We observe that learning can be significantly predicted by motivation and that percep-
tual with-me-ness can be predicted by motivation. Finally, there is a significant prediction
of learning by motivation and AOI backtracks, however the coefficient of motivation is

the relation between motivation and learning. We can see that the correlation between
the motivation and the learning is more positive for the students with high number AOI
backtracks than that for the students with low number of AOI backtracks. It is clear from
Fig. 9 that the students with high motivation have higher chances of getting a high score
if they perform more AOI backtracks than the students with lower motivation.

Next, we observe that that learning can be significantly predicted by motivation, and
that AOI misses can be predicted by motivation. Also, there is a significant prediction
of learning by motivation and AOI misses, however the coefficient of motivation is still
significant anymore. Thus we can conclude that the AOI misses only partially mediates
the relation between motivation and learning. We can see that the correlation between
the motivation and the learning is more negative for the students with high number
AOI misses than that for the students with low number of AOI misses. It is clear from
Fig. 9 that the students with low motivation have higher chances of getting a low score
if they miss more AOIs than the students with higher motivation.

With-me-ness
To examine the mediation effect of with-me-ness we tested the model shown in Fig. 10
with both the perceptual and the conceptual variables of with-me-ness. As shown in Table
2, the direct link between motivation and both variables of with-me-ness was significant
and hence satisfied the first condition. The link between motivation and learning was also
significant and hence satisfied the second condition as well. Moreover, the direct relation-
ship between motivation with learning was not significant when with-me-ness variables
(perceptual and the conceptual) were added. In Table 2 we present the results of the two
mediation analyses (row four for perceptual and row five for conceptual with-me-ness).
We observe that learning can be significantly predicted by motivation and that per-

ceptual with-me-ness can be predicted by motivation. Finally, there is a significant

see that the correlation between the motivation and the learning is more positive for
the students with high perceptual with-me-ness than that for the students with low
perceptual with-me-ness. It is clear from Fig. 10 that the students with high motivation
have higher chances of getting a high score if they high perceptual with-me-ness than
the students with lower motivation.

Next, we observe that that learning can be significantly predicted by motivation, and
that conceptual with-me-ness can be predicted by motivation. Also, there is a signifi-
cant prediction of learning by motivation and conceptual with-me-ness, however the
coefficient of motivation is not significant anymore. Thus we can conclude that the
conceptual with-me-ness fully mediates the relation between motivation and learning.
We can see that the correlation between the motivation and the learning is more posi-
tive for the students with high conceptual with-me-ness than that for the students with
low conceptual with-me-ness. It is clear from Fig. 10 that the students with high motiv-
ation have higher chances of getting a high score if they high conceptual with-me-ness
than the students with lower motivation.

Prediction results

Figure 11 shows the prediction results for the students’ learning and motivation. For
learning prediction, we observed a minimum error of 5.04% (SD =0.52%) using the
Gaussian Process Model with a polynomial kernel. The second least error of 8.07%
(SD = 0.54%) was obtained using a Support Vector Machine also with a polynomial ker-
nel. The worst error rate was found to be 11.18% (Sd = 0.63%) using the Generalised
additive models. For motivation prediction, we observed similar performances with the

prediction algorithms. We observed a minimum error of 9.04% (SD = 0.56%) using the

Discussions and conclusions

The reported study developed and empirically explored two models, where teacher/stu-
dent co-attention (i.e., with-me-ness) were found to mediate the relationship of motiv-
ation and learning in MOOC videos. These two models demonstrated how the aspect
of co-attention, not only influences learning, but also affects the effect of motivation in
learning. Quantifying an often-overlooked element (i.e., instructor’s capacity to draw
student’s attention) in online courses.

The attention points, derived from the heat-maps, were indicative of the students’ at-
tention both in the terms of screen space and time. The area of the attention points
depended on the time spent on a specific area on the screen. Higher average area of
the attention points could be interpreted as more reading time during a particular
period. The good performing students having a higher motivation had the highest con-
tent coverage (larger areas of the attention) among all the participants, despite having
spent the similar time on the slides.

However, more reading time did not always guarantee higher performance. Byrne,
Freebody, and Gates (1992) showed the inverse in a longitudinal reading study by prov-
ing that the best performing students were the fastest readers. On the other hand,
Reinking (1988) showed that there was no relation between the comprehension and
reading time. As Just and Carpenter (1980) put “There is no single mode of reading.
Reading varies as a function of who is reading, what they are reading, and why they are
reading it.” The uncertainty of results about the relation between the performance and
the reading time led us to find the relation between the reading time, performance and
learning motivation. We found that the good-performers had more reading time than
poor-performers and the high motivated-learners had more reading time than low
motivated-learners. We could interpret this reading behaviour, based upon the reading
time differences, in terms of more attention being paid by the good performing stu-
dents having a high learning motivation than other student profiles. We could use
Sharma et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:13 Page 16 of 19

content coverage to give feedback to the students about their attention span. Moreover,
one could use the content coverage for student profiling as well based on the perform-
ance and the learning motivation.

The area of interest (AOI) misses and back-tracks were the temporal features com-
puted from the temporal order of AOIs looked at. We found that good-performers with
high motivation had significantly fewer AOI misses than the poor-performers with low
motivation. AOI misses could be useful in providing students with the feedback about
their viewing behaviour just by looking at what AOIs they missed.

The AOI back-tracks were indicative of the rereading behaviour of the students. We
found that the good performers and highly motivated learners had significantly more back-
tracks than the poor-performers. Moreover, some of the good-performers back-tracked to
all the previously seen content, this explains the special distribution of AOI back-tracks for
good-performers. Millis and King (2001) and Dowhower (1987) showed in their studies that
rereading improved the comprehension. In the present study, the scenario is somewhat dif-
ferent than Millis and King (2001) and Dowhower (1987). In the present study, the students
did not read the study material again. Instead, the students referred back to the previously
seen content again during the time the slide was visible to them. Thus, the relation between
rereading of the same content and the performance should be taken cautiously, clearly fur-
ther experimentation is needed to reach a causal conclusion.

One interesting finding in the present study was the fact that the content coverage had
fully mediated the relation between the performance and the learning motivation.
Whereas, the AOI misses and AOI back-tracks had partial mediation effects. This could
be interpreted in terms of the type of information we considered to compute the respect-
ive variables. For example, the content coverage computation took into account both the
screen space and the time information and AOI back-tracks (and misses) computation re-
quired only the temporal information. However, in the context of the present study, we
could not conclude the separation between spatial and temporal information and how it
effected the relation between the gaze variables and performance and learning strategy.

In addition, we found that high-performers (those who scored high in the test) had
more perceptual with-me-ness on the referred sites than the low-performers. This is in
accordance with the literature, where Jermann and Niissli (2012), showed that better per-
forming pairs had more recurrent gaze patterns during the moments of deictic references.
We also found that the students who scored better in the test, were following the teacher,
both in deictic and discourse, in an efficient manner than those who did not score well in
the test. These results were not surprising, but could be utilised to inform the students
about their attention levels during MOOC lectures in an automatic and objective manner.
The results also contribute towards our long-term goal of defining the student profiles
based on their performance and motivation using the gaze data. The attention points can
serve the purpose of a delayed feedback to the students based on their attention span.

The conceptual with-me-ness can be explained as a gaze-measure for the efforts of the
student to sustain common ground within the teacher-student dyad. Dillenbourg and
Traum (2006) and Richardson, Dale, and Kirkham (2007) emphasised upon the importance
of grounding gestures to sustain shared understanding in collaborative problem solving sce-
narios. A video is not a dialogue; the learner has to build common grounds, asymmetrically,
with the teacher. The correlation we observed between conceptual with-me-ness and the
test score (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) seemed to support this hypothesis.
Sharma et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:13 Page 17 of 19

Another interesting finding of our study is that the conceptual with-me-ness has
more percentage mediation than the perceptual with-me-ness (39% for conceptual as
compared to 33% for perceptual with-me-ness). This shows that eye-tracking can not
only provide access to students’ attention but also to the students’ information process-
ing mechanisms as well. Thus, students gaze is an important source of information that
can be used to inform online learning.

Finally, from the prediction results, we were able to show that the heat-maps cannot
be only used as a popular visualization tools, but also as a source of features to predict
performance and other traits, such as motivation. The best prediction results for the
performance was with a 5.04% normalized error. In terms of a quiz-based evaluation of
learning, which in our case are 10 questions, this error translates to less than one ques-
tion. For example, if a student answers 9 questions correctly, our method will predict
the score within the range of [8.5—9.5]. Similarly, on the motivation scale, which is a 5-
point Likert scale making it in the range of [0 -- 50], the error of 9.04% would translate
to one incorrect prediction out of ten on the scale proposed by Biggs et al. (2001).

Additionally, in this contribution, the eye-tracking variables we defined had different
pre-processing requirement. These variables also have capacities in terms of being used
within an adaptive and real-time system. The computation of content coverage is real-
time and requires no pre-processing of the data or the stimulus. The Scan-path vari-
ables can also be computed in real-time and there is small amount of pre-processing
required in term of defining the area of interest (AOI) to be able to compute them. The
pre-processing for computing the perceptual with-me-ness could be automatized since
there are computer-vision methods to detect pointing/other deictic gestures of the
teacher. Once this detection is done, the real-time computation of Perceptual with-me-
ness if fairly straightforward. Finally, the conceptual with-me-ness, requires a few manual
interventions in transcribing the teachers’ dialogues and mapping them to the content.
This acts as a hindrance in the real-time computation of the conceptual with-me-ness,
and therefore, this is the only gaze-based measure used in this study that requires further
work to be used as within a personalised adaptive gaze-based feedback system.

To gain further insight into the design of MOOC videos and the affordances of the
respective systems, we need to consider eye-gaze measurements (or can call them gaze
analytics) that we found to not only strongly associated with learning, but also mediate
the influence of other variables (i-e., motivation). Discussing these features from a tech-
nical standpoint can give rise to practical implications for the design of MOOC videos
(e.g., designed in a way to draw students’ attention (Kizilcec et al., 2014) and the re-
spective video-based learning systems (e.g., offer an indication of students’ attention
based on the web-camera).

For future work, we are now beginning to collect eye-tracking data from different
types instruction (e.g., pair problem solving) utilizing different stimulus (e.g., not con-
trolled from the student like the video). In addition, we intend to investigate whether a
plausible association exists between different students (e.g., novices). After identifying
the role of with-me-ness and other gaze-analytics in different contexts, we will be able
to propose how gaze-analytics can be integrated to various contemporary learning sys-
tems. For example, allowing us to enable student profiles based on their performance
and learning strategy using gaze-analytics, and ultimately provide gaze-aware feedback
to improve the overall learning process.
