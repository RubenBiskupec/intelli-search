Abstract

As the structures of multiarm robots are serially arranged, the packaging and transportation of these robots are often
inconvenient. The ability of these robots to operate objects must also be improved. Addressing this issue, this paper
presents a type of multiarm robot that can be adequately folded into a designed area. The robot can achieve different
operation modes by combining different arms and objects. First, deployable kinematic chains (DKCs) are designed,
which can be folded into a designated area and be used as an arm structure in the multiarm robot mechanism. The
strategy of a platform for storing DKCs is proposed. Based on the restrictions in the storage area and the character-
istics of parallel mechanisms, a class of DKCs, called base assembly library, is obtained. Subsequently, an assembly

method for the synthesis of the multiarm robot mechanism is proposed, which can be formed by the connection of
a multiarm robot mechanism with an operation object based on a parallel mechanism structure. The formed parallel
mechanism can achieve a reconfigurable characteristic when different DKCs connect to the operation object. Using
this method, two types of multiarm robot mechanisms with four DKCs that can switch operation modes to perform
different tasks through autonomous combination and release operation is proposed. The obtained mechanisms have
observable advantages when compared with the traditional mechanisms, including optimizing the occupied volume
during transportation and using parallel mechanism theory to analyze the switching of operation modes.

1 Introduction

The multiarm robot mechanism is a type of mechanism
that is composed of several kinematic chains in a serial
connection. The typical multiarm robot mechanisms are
structurally similar and include a multiarm cooperative
operation mechanism, space manipulator, certain mul-
tifingered hand mechanisms, and a walking robot [1-7].
The finger or leg of the multifingered or walking robot
mechanism can be treated as the arm of the multiarm
robot mechanism. As these types of mechanisms can be
utilized in several applications such as fire rescue, sat-
ellite coupling, and motion object capture, the robot

mechanism has attracted considerable attention. In
recent years, certain scholars have attempted to improve
the performance of the multiarm robot mechanism by
optimizing the design mechanism structure and have
proposed a novel conceptual design theory with signifi-
cant results [8, 9].

However, the traditional multiarm robot mechanism
often suffers from certain key problems. Generally, the
arms of these robots have links that are connected in
series. Because the mechanism requires a higher degree
of freedom (DOF), it usually requires multiple actuation
joints to connect each link in series. Consequently, the
body of the mechanism has too many links and relatively
large size. The large size of the body causes inconvenience
during the transportation of these types of robots. There-
fore, it is necessary to design a stacking method for the
mechanism so that it can be reasonably contained in a

carrier when it is transported or when it is not function-
ing and can be easily expanded when it must be operated.
Based on the structural determination of the mecha-
nism, the achievable operations should be diversified as
much as possible to improve work efficiency. For exam-
ple, when the mechanism is applied for the exploration
of the moon and in deep space, it is often necessary for
the mechanism to clean, pick up, transport, and load the
target after close observation and analysis. Sometimes,
observation or detection of the target for grinding, drill-
ing, and other operations is also required. As the mecha-
nism can only perform deterministic tasks after finalizing
the structural design, to achieve diversified operations, it
is necessary to use the multiarm concept to obtain a rea-
sonable switch to achieve a change in the working mode.
When the multiarm robot mechanism connects to the
operation object, the formed structure can be treated as a
parallel structure; several scholars use the design concept
of the parallel mechanism to optimize the operation con-
figuration of such a mechanism. The purpose is to change
a single-arm operation into a multiarm operation and
allocate the required number of motors to avoid creating
a significantly long single arm. In addition, this method
considers the operation object as the moving platform or
output of the formed virtual parallel mechanism. Con-
sequently, such a mechanism can perform deterministic
operation tasks. Based on the concept of a parallel mech-
anism, Ozgiir et al. [10, 11] designed a dexterous hand
and obtained a new type of grasping mechanism. Borras
et al. [12, 13] also designed a dexterous hand by using the
parallel mechanism concept and analyzed the dexterous
hand through the force-closure method. The kinematics
problem of the dexterous hand is solved by analyzing a
Jacobian matrix of the formed parallel mechanism. Ding
et al. [14] and Zhai et al. [15] designed an integrated arm
and leg mechanism that can traverse complex terrains
and has redundant degrees of freedom. Corves et al.
[16] designed a robot system with reconfigurable prop-
erties by using the design idea of a parallel mechanism,
which can achieve repetitive grabbing of objects and the
reconstruction of dynamic characteristics. Nefz et al.
[17] proposed a multifinger mechanism for gripping.
By using the method where the fingers and objects can
form a parallel mechanism, the appropriate manipulator
is obtained. The corresponding performance was investi-
gated. To improve the performance of the walking robot,
Ding et al. [14] proposed a wheel-legged hexapod robot
to manipulate objects with legs. This robot mimics the
control and movement of insects pertaining to their legs.
Koyachi et al. [18] presented a concept of “limb mecha-
nism, which consists of links and joints that interface
the body of the robot with the ground. Inoue et al. [19]
presented an approach to improve the maneuverability of

Page 2 of 17

the arm by adjusting the motion of the legs. To improve
the operation ability of multiarm robots, several scholars
have conducted research on capture characteristics [20,
21], reconfigurable manipulation [22], modeling [7], and
performance evaluation [23].

As mentioned above, another key problem is in design-
ing a stacking method through which the mechanism
can be satisfactorily contained in a carrier when it is
transported or has stopped working, and it can be easily
expanded during the work. Inspired by the characteris-
tics of the traditional deployable mechanism, the multi-
arm robot mechanism can be designed as a mechanism
with a deployable arm structure. The characteristics
of the traditional deployable mechanism include small
volume for easy storage, ease in transportation, and
certain other performance characteristics. The mecha-
nism can fold into designated areas during transporta-
tion and unfold when it is required for work. The design
procedure of the traditional deployable mechanism is
to first design individual deployable units [24—26], and
then combine these units to form a deployable mecha-
nism. To create a traditional multiarm robot mecha-
nism with deployable performance, we can reference the
design method of the traditional deployable mechanism.
On the one hand, the arms can be designed as deploy-
able units, which can be folded into a designated area.
On the other hand, the multiarm robot mechanism and
operation object or external environment can constitute
a parallel mechanism structure. Therefore, the combi-
nation principle of deployable units can be achieved by
the parallel mechanism synthesis method. The obtained
novel multiarm robot mechanisms possess advantages
such as ease in transportation and easy configurability of
operations when compared to traditional multiarm robot
mechanisms.

Hence, this research studied the design of deployable
kinematic chains (DKCs), which can be folded into a
designated area and be used for the design of the robot.
This method is aimed at introducing deployable charac-
teristics and is a design method that incorporates parallel
mechanism into the traditional multiarm robot mecha-
nism so that the arms of the robot can be easily deployed
and demonstrate improved storage performance. At the
same time, the structural synthesis for operational task
topology can be performed through the concept that the
multiarm robot mechanism and the operating object can
form a structure with a parallel mechanism. This part
is presented in Section 2. The strategy of a platform for
storing DKCs is proposed. In Section 3, a class of DKCs
called base assembly library (BAL) is discussed and an
assembly method for the design of the multiarm robot is
presented. Using this method, two types of robot mecha-
nisms with four DKCs that can switch operating modes
Zhao et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:70

to complete different tasks through autonomous com-
bination and release with operation are presented in
Section 4. The advantages of the proposed mechanisms
when compared to the traditional mechanisms are dem-
onstrated. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Section 5.

2 Conceptual Design of Multiarm Robot
2.1 Description of Multiarm Robot Working Mode and Task
Topology

In this paper, two types of multiarm robot mechanisms
are proposed, which can be applied to perform differ-
ent operations. The first type of mechanism is the Type-
I mechanism. Its topological logic diagram and working
mode are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows that each
DKC is folded into its designated area in the fixed plat-
form when it is nonworking. If the mechanism is required
to operate an object, some of the DKCs will unfold and
connect to the object as shown in Figure 1b. It is easy
to observe that a parallel mechanism structure will be
formed when two or more DKCs connect to the object.
Those DKCs are limbs of the virtual parallel mecha-
nism, and the object is a moving platform in this paral-
lel mechanism. Therefore, different operation modes can

Page 3 of 17

be achieved when different DKCs connect to the object.
In this case, the formed parallel mechanism can also be
treated as a reconfiguration. Here, we define the chain
that connects to the object as an active DKC and the non-
working chain as a resting DKC.

In the folded-deployed process, every joint of the chain
is an actuated joint. When DKCs connect to the object
and perform operations on the object, some of the joints
will turn into passive joints based on the parallel mecha-
nism theory.

The second type of mechanism is the Type-II mecha-
nism, as shown in Figure 2. This mechanism has a two-
level platform, which includes the upper and lower
platforms for storing DKCs. Both the upper and lower
platforms can connect to the object to construct a paral-
lel mechanism through DKCs. When the multiarm robot
mechanism is used as a spatial manipulator to perform
operational tasks, the two platforms are fixed to a fixed
base. The task topological logic diagram of the Type-II
mechanism is shown in Figure 2b. PM, is composed of
object-1 and the DKCs of the upper platform, and PM,
is composed of object-2 and DKCs of the lower plat-
form. Each parallel mechanism structure can produce

independent motion. For this type of mechanism, two
parallel mechanisms can achieve concurrent operation
to achieve superposition and complementarity of the kin-
ematic performance.

If the operation object is the ground, the Type-I mecha-
nism can be used as a walking robot mechanism. When it
works, each chain can expand and form a parallel mech-
anism with the ground. The fixed platform will become
the end effector of the virtual parallel mechanism, while
the ground will become the fixed platform of this virtual
parallel mechanism. The mechanism can achieve the task
requirements of walking and carrying a load. In the Type-
II mechanism, the upper and lower platforms can also
construct a configuration in the form of “serial—parallel”
structure through the DKCs that expand based on the
external environment and operating objects. When the
DKCs of the lower platform connect to the ground, the
formed parallel mechanism can adjust the posture and
other work tasks of the upper platform.

It should be noted that there are various types of con-
tacts between the end of the walking robot or multifin-
ger hand mechanism and the operation object; therefore,
the relative DOFs between the end of these mechanisms
and the operation object can range from 0 to 6. To clearly
illustrate the application of the parallel mechanism
design idea into the multiarm robot mechanism design,
this paper primarily considers the mechanism that can be
applied to the spatial manipulator. Both the joint of the
chain and the contact between the chains and the object
indicate one-DOF motions. Nevertheless, the contact
type considered in this paper can also be used as a special
form of the multiple contact forms of terminal contact in
a walking robot mechanism.

2.2 Configurable Operation Degree of Multiarm Robot

After proposing the concept of the multiarmed robot
mechanism, it is necessary to determine the number
of DKCs configured by the mechanism and the DKC
switching strategy to perform different operation modes.
The number of DKCs to be configured in each platform

Page 4 of 17

should be greater than two and less than six for the fol-
lowing reasons:

1. To form a closed-loop parallel mechanism structure
between the DKCs and an object, the number of DKCs
should not be less than two.

2. As the maximum DOF of an object in space is six,
the virtual parallel mechanism formed by the multiple
arms and object should have a maximum of six DKCs for
nonredundancy, that is, the maximum number of DKCs
configured in the platform is six.

As mentioned in Section 2.1, the DKC that connects to
the object is an active DKC, denoted by A. The DKC that
is nonworking is a resting DKC, denoted by R, as listed in
Table 1. L indicates the number of DKCs that connect to
the object. The multiarm robot mechanism can achieve
different operating modes on an object by connecting
different DKCs to the object. Because the structures of
the DKCs are different, the topological forms of parallel
mechanisms formed by the different DKCs and object
are different, which results in different operations on the
object. After determining the number of DKCs in the
platform, the total number of operation modes that the
DKCs can implement on an object is denoted by a con-
figurable operation degree. Then, the relation between
the DOF of the entire mechanism, configurable operation
degree, and number of DKCs can be obtained as listed in
Table 1.

2.3 Storage Area for Deployable Kinematic Chain (DKC)

of Multiarm Robot
Because the shape or length of DKC is often restricted by
the dimension of the storage area, the area for DKC stor-
age should be determined first before designing the DKC
configuration. Further, as the number of DKCs increases,
the storage area of each DKC should be smaller.

Figure 3 shows the storage area diagrams of the most
common six-arm and four-arm mechanisms. In a sym-
metrical arrangement of chains, six chains divide 360°
into six sections. Similarly, four chains divide 360° into
four sections. Assuming that the base link is the first
link of each DKC and is connected to the folding plat-
form, the minimum space occupied by each DKC after

folding the design is never less than that occupied by the
base link. Therefore, if the multiarm robot mechanism
is designed to occupy the minimum area in the folding
state, the minimum occupied space of the mechanism in
the folding state is composed of the folding platform and
each base link. Thus, each base link forms both the stor-
age area and area boundary as shown in Figure 3.

To achieve the spatial operation of DKCs on an object,
each DKC has more than three links. Frequently, the
shape of the link is a straight line. At the same time, the
storage area of the four-arm mechanism is decomposed
into four rectangular or square areas, which can better
store each DKC and improve the utilization efficiency.
Because the mechanism usually does not require six
DOFs when performing a single task, the four-arm robot
mechanism is sufficient to integrate multiple tasks by
using different DKCs to connect to the object.

Therefore, we designed the configuration of the DKC
based on the region and dimension constraints of the
rectangle and square in the four-arm robot mechanism.
The designed DKC configuration can fold into the rec-
tangular storage area in the nonworking state and is in
the same plane as the folding platform. By connecting
different DKCs to an object, the virtual parallel mecha-
nism can be reconfigured, which can change the opera-
tion mode of the multiarm robot mechanism.

According to Table 1, when four DKCs are config-
ured in the folding platform, the number of active and
resting chain configurations are: (A:4, R:0), (A:3, R:1),
and (A:2, R:2). Let us consider the case of (A:3, R:1) as
an example. The object can connect with three limbs
to form a parallel structure as shown in Figure 4a. In
Table 1, when A=3 and R=1, four combinations will
appear as shown in Figure 4. In the nonredundant par-
allel mechanism, the three limbs can give the object

three DOFs. Here, we define these three DOFs as the
initial DOFs. As different limbs have different con-
straints on the object, the PM, structure formed by
the object and limbs-1,2,3 changes into the PM, struc-
ture formed by the object and limbs-1, 2, 4, which can
modify at least one DOF. Similarly, the PM, and PM,
structures can also modify one DOF from the previous
configuration. Therefore, the four-arm robot mecha-
nism can have the operation of all six DOFs on the
object by using three different limbs.

Figure 5a shows the boundary of each storage area
and the space occupied by the mechanism when it is
folded. Because the DKC configuration is composed of
a base link in series with several links, the storage area
can be divided into two subareas. One is the storage
area of the base link. The other is the additional area of
the rest of the DKC. In the four-arm robot mechanism,
the lengths of the four base links determine the bound-
ary of the occupied space. As shown in Figure 5, base
link-1 and base link-3 determine the length of occupied
space along the x-axis. Similarly, base link-2 and base
link-4 determine the length of occupied space along the
y-axis. In addition, each base link determines the length
in one direction of its adjacent region. Therefore, the
storage area (region within the dotted lines) for each
DKC is formed as shown in Figure 5a. Figure 5b is a
case of the four-arm robot mechanism that shows the
folding configuration and the corresponding definition.

The advantages of this arrangement are as follows.
First, the rectangular region can be used to store
the DKC to the maximum extent. Besides, when the
mechanism acts as a spatial manipulator or multifin-
gered hand, it can switch the operation mode using
different DKCs to connect to the operation object. In
the next section, we discuss how to design the DKC

3 Configuration Design of DKC

3.1 Determination of Joint Number

Frequently, if the operation of F DOFs is performed on
the operation object, the link degree of each chain must
be at least equal to F. In the nonredundant case, the
link degree C,; should be no more than six; then:

where the link degree C; is equal to the sum of DOFs of
the joints in each chain.

The joint number of the kinematic chain is denoted
by m,. Hence, we obtain:

According to Table 1, the number of DOFs of the
mechanism is limited, that is:

6>F>2. (3)

Assuming the DOFs of all joints are equal to 1, f=1.
Then, from Eq. (2), it can be determined that the number
of joints must satisfy:

6 > m; > 2. (4)

For the four-arm robot mechanism adopted in this
paper, when the chain is folded, all the links should
be located on the plane where the folding platform is
located. In the robot mechanism, the joints are usu-
ally prismatic (P) and revolute (R) joints. The R joint in

DKC is the key joint to achieve the conversion between
in-plane folded form and operation in space. The num-
ber of R joints should not be less than the number of P
joints required to achieve this conversion. Therefore, the
relationship between the number of R joints in the chain
and the number of P joints should satisfy the following
formula:

Ry > Pr. (5)

If the number and types of joints in the chains satisfy
Eqs. (4) and (5), then the DKC has the following config-
urations: 6R, 5R1P, 5R, 4R1P, 3R2P, 4R, 3R1P, 2R2P, 3R,
2R1P, 2R, 1R1P.

3.2 Extensibility of DKC

The storage region formed by the DKCs through struc-
tural characteristics is used for folding and storing the
chains. The structural parameters of the chain should
satisfy the constraint conditions of the storage region.
As mentioned in Section 2.3, the storage area in the
four-arm mechanism is the area indicated by dashed
lines in Figure 6. The size of the storage area along
the x- and y-axes is set to L, and L,,. When the DKC is
folding, the length of the longest link member in two
directions in the storage area should not exceed each
boundary of this area. In Figure 6, the first joint that
connects to the platform is defined as the root of the
DKC, and the R joint at the beginning and end of each
boundary is named the fold factor. Figure 6a illustrates
an unreasonable configuration as the DKC exceeds
the storage area. Figure 6b illustrates a reasonable

configuration. From Figure 6, we can observe that the
fold factor determines whether the DKC can fold into
the area reasonably.

The DKCs with deployable performance include two
aspects:

(1) Each link in the kinematic chain is in the same
plane when folded;

(2) Each link connected by the fold factor can rotate
toward the root.

Next, we extend the study to determine how the
links connect together to satisfy these two aspects. In
Figure 7a, we assume the folding movement from the
first joint to the last joint of DKC follows the follow-
ing direction: a, b, c, d. By comparing Figure 7a and
b, it can be observed that link BC in Figure 7a is col-
linear with the axis of the R joint, i.e., B. The R joint (B)
can produce a circular trajectory through its rotation;
moreover, it cannot change the direction of the link BC
or move toward the root of the chain; consequently, the
link has no folding capacity. Therefore, link BC should
be perpendicular to the axis of joint B. Further, the axis
of joint B should never be collinear in the b direction.
This is because, if the axis of joint B is collinear in the
b direction, links BC and AB will interfere with each

Page 8 of 17

other. Therefore, based on the above two principles, we
can obtain the reasonable extension of DKC along four
directions as shown in Figure 7c.

After determining all the fold factors of DKC, we can
add R and P joints between the fold factors to obtain
the DKCs with different DOFs. Here, the direction of
the axis of the added R joint can be arbitrary.

3.3 Base Assembly Library

Based on the above conclusions, we can obtain differ-
ent configurations of DKCs. To design different types of
DKCs to operate a single arm as a multiarm robot mech-
anism, we can use the following steps. First, by using the
equations in Section 3.1, we can determine the required
number of joints m, which can be obtained according to
the number of DOFs achieved at the end of the DKC, that
is, the number of joints should be equal to the number
of DOFs. Then, after the number of joints is obtained,
the method proposed in Section 3.2 is used to design the
deployable characteristic of the kinematic chains so that
they can be stored in the specified area.

For a deployable design, we should determine the num-
ber of fold factors in the chain. As mentioned above, the
fold factors are the R joints at the beginning and end of
each boundary. For the storage area proposed in this

can be expressed as a set [25]. After the motion set is
assigned to each DKC, the appropriate DKC configura-
tion can be selected according to the required output
motion.

4 Design of Multiarm Robot Mechanism Based

on DKCs
4.1 Combination Design Method of Multiarm Robot

Mechanism

4.1.1 Chain Decomposition Method
The design method of the traditional parallel mechanism
[27, 28] is to distribute the DOF of the end effector into
each limb to obtain the ideal configuration. For a Type-I
mechanism, the DKCs of the mechanism can release and
connect to the object through releasable joints to achieve
the transformation of the working mode. Therefore, DKC
groups corresponding to different operation modes must
be decomposed and represented. From Table 1, it can be
noted that the number of connections between DKCs and
the operation object is 2, 3, and 4 in the four-arm mecha-
nism. In this section, we use a motion set to describe the
motion of the operation object that can be achieved by
connecting to the multiarm robot mechanism. The motion
set can be decomposed into different subsets. Then, these
subsets can be implemented through different DKCs that
are connected to the object. Here, we define this method as
the chain decomposition method and use the chain decom-
position to describe the motion of the object connected to
different DKCs.

When the number of connections between the DKCs
and the operation object is two, it indicates that each work-
ing mode consists of two different DKCs connected to the
object to form a parallel mechanism. There are six chain
groups of two different DKCs in the four-arm mechanism.

According to Table 1, the chain groups contain two dif-
ferent DKCs corresponding to the case (L=4, R=2) that
can complete the switch of six different modes. As shown
in Figure 11, the platform connects to the operation object

Page 10 of 17

through two DKCs, and the motion set of the object should
be equal to the intersection of the motion sets of two
DKCs, which can be expressed as follows.

My= {S, S39} (6)

Here, M; represents the motion that can be achieved
when the operation object is connected to the i-th
chain group, S,; represents the motion provided by the
i-th chain.

Because there are six chain groups of two differ-
ent DKCs in the four-arm mechanism, six motion sets
of each working mode are obtained. Hence, the total
motion set of the object that is generated by the mech-
anism can be calculated through the union of motion
sets of each working mode.

M = {M1 1 M2 U M3 U M4 U Ms U Me}
= {81M S2}N {$2 S3}U {$3 Sq}. (7)
U {$1 Sq} U {So N Sg} U {81 1 $3}

To illustrate the construction of chain decomposi-
tion, we consider the motion set of the object into two
chain groups as an example. First, the motion set of the
object is given as:

M = (T, 0 Ty; 0 R, 0), (8)

where T, represents the operation object moving along
i direction, R; represents the rotation of the operation
object in i direction.

Let us assume that {M} is the component of
motion transmission sets M, and M,, that is
{M, U M2} Cc {M}; then, we can select a special assign-
ment {S,1S3} = {M,}{S.1S4} = {M,}; the motion
transmission set M, can be written as:

{My} = {81 1 $3}
— (T,, 0 Ty: 000) (9)

Similarly, M, can be written as:

{M2} = {S2M Sq}

= (00 Ty; OR, 0). (10)
Then:
M = {My U Mo}
=(T,0Ty; 00 0)UOTy; ORO). (11)

= (T, 0 Ty; 0 R, 0)

However, this is just one of the cases that divide the
motion set of the object to subsets of different chain
groups. We can obtain the appropriate mechanism
according to the different subsets.

Similarly, there are four chain groups of three differ-
ent DKCs in the four-arm mechanism. The total motion
set of the object that is generated by the mechanism
can be expressed as:

M = {M,; U M2 U M3 U My}
= {8, NS2M S83} U {S21 83M Sq}
U {$81,183 1 S4} U {$1 N S29 $4}

(12)

As illustrated in Figure 12, the three DKCs can be
selected to give the object a deterministic motion.

My = {81 182 S3}. (13)

If M= (T,, T,T,; RB, RB, 0), the four subsets of {M} can
be determined according to the required mode switch.
If the motion set M, is as follows:

My = {81 N S82 $3}

=(T, 0 Ty; R,00) (14)

Then, we determine the fourth DKC that can permit
the elements of M,, M3, M, to contain T, and R,. Then,
the motion set of the object is obtained by the union of
the four subsets.

M = {M,; U M2 U M3 U My}

15
= (Ty, Ty Tw; Ry R, 0) ( )

Page 11 of 17

When L=4 and R=0, there is only one configuration
where the four DKCs connect to the object. Moreover,
the motion set of the object is:

M = {81 182M 831 Sq}. (16)

4.1.2 Platform Decomposition Method
In the Type-II mechanism, there are two platforms
with DKCs. The DKCs of each platform can connect to
an object to form a parallel mechanism, and the work-
ing task is achieved by the concurrent operation of the
formed two parallel mechanisms. Thus, the Type-II
mechanism can be treated as two Type-I mechanisms
fixed together. According to the task, we can determine
the relative motion required to complete the motion. To
complete the relative motion, the independent motion
that two platforms must produce is denoted as N. Then,
it is distributed to the two platforms so that each motion
set contains N. The schematic diagram of platform
decomposition with three DKCs is shown in Figure 13.

As shown in Figure 13, the motion sets of object-1 of
the upper platform and object-2 of the lower platform are
denoted as {M,} and {M,}, respectively.

The output motion of these two parallel mechanisms
can be expressed as follows:

Mu = Sui Su2 Su3; Mi = $11 9 Sp2 M Sz3.
(17)
According to the task, we can determine the motion
element for the relative motion generation. The motion
element, noted by N, is the subset of {My} and (M;}:

NCMy; NCMLz. (18)

Therefore, when the motion sets of two parallel mecha-
nisms that are formed by the upper and lower platforms
contain the motion element, each parallel mechanism
can produce relatively independent motion. In Sec-
tion 4.3, we will introduce a case to illustrate this design
procedure.

4.2 Design Procedure of Multiarm Robot Mechanism

If we use the attribute of the parallel mechanism struc-
ture to determine the combination scheme of DKCs, the
motion set {M} is always given first in the design proce-
dure. After determining {M}, we can determine whether
the mode switch is required to complete the motion.
Then, the numbers of DKCs can be obtained according
to Table 1 and a further structure of the active and resting
limbs can be determined. Next, we can use the formulas
and the limitations of the storage area to determine the
joint number and select the DKCs of the BAL that satisfy
the condition. Consequently, the multiarm robot mech-
anism designed based on this method is intrinsically
related to the DKCs and operation object, which share
the same structural attributes as the parallel mechanisms
designed previously by other researchers. The design
procedure is illustrated in Figure 14.

4.3 Case Study

4.3.1 Type-I Multiarm Robot Mechanism

As shown in Figure 14, the first step is to determine the
motion mode and whether the mode switch is required.
Here, we assume that the motion set to be achieved by
the mechanism is M=(T, T, T,; R, R, 0) and it can be
achieved by the mode switch.

Then, the second step is to determine the number of
active and resting DKCs. For the four-arm mechanism in
this paper, let us consider an example as L=4, R=1, that
is, there are three DKCs connected to the object in each
mode. Under this configuration, each mode can produce
three motion types on the object. Moreover, four groups

of three DKCs can produce four different motion types
on the object.

The third step is to divide M into different groups for
motion mode switch. As mentioned in the second step,
four modes can achieve motion when we consider the
configuration as L=4, R=1. The set corresponding to
each mode is: M,, M,, Ms, M,. Here, we consider one of
the solutions as:

 

M, = (T, 0 Ty; R, 00)
M2 = (T, 0 Ty; R, 00)
M3 = 00 Ty; Ry Ry 0)
Mg = (0 T, Ty; R, 00)

(19)

According to Eq. (19), we can select three DKCs that
can satisfy M,. That is, the intersection of the motion
set S; (i=1, 2, 3) of three DKCs can achieve M,. Then, a
fourth DKC can be added to ensure that the remaining
three chain groups satisfy the conditions of M,, Ms, M,.
Thus, by combining the four DKCs, the four-arm mecha-
nism can be obtained.

Figure 15 is a case of the Type-I mechanism. The mech-
anism can switch different working modes through dif-
ferent DKC groups connected to an object.

4.3.2 Type-Il Multiarm Robot Mechanism

As shown in Figure 2, there are two platforms in the
Type-II mechanism. Each platform has four DKCs, which
can connect to an object to form a parallel mechanism.
The Type-II mechanism can be treated as two Type-
I mechanisms performing collaborative work tasks.
The motion set achieved by the Type-II mechanism is

generated by the relatively independent motion of the
two Type-I mechanisms. According to the platform
decomposition method in Section 4.1.2, we can deter-
mine the key motion elements that can achieve the work
task and determine the Type-I motion sets that contain
the key elements. Figure 16 shows a simple bending dia-
gram. The parallel mechanisms formed by the two plat-
forms cooperate to achieve the bending of the plate. As
can be observed from the figure, plate bending requires
two platforms to achieve rotation around the x-axis, that

is, the motion of R, should be included in the motion sets
of upper and lower platforms.

Hence, there are several solutions to this simple
bending. The motion sets generated by the upper and
lower platforms must contain R, and T,. Here, N is a set
consisting of R,, T,, ie, N= (00 T,; R, 0 0). If we still
set L=4 and R=1, the formed two mechanisms have
four operation modes, and only one of the modes is
required to achieve the movement of R,, T,.

Then, we can provide arbitrary values to My and M,
as long as they satisfy Eq. (18). For the convenience of
further discussion, we used the aforementioned Type-I
mechanism as the mechanism in the upper and lower
platforms of the Type-II mechanism. The schematic
diagram of this work is as shown in Figure 17.

The Type-II mechanism shown in Figure 17 is just one
configuration of solutions. Through the cooperation of
the two platforms, the mechanism can achieve working
processes from grasping and bending to placing. We can
adjust the values of M,; and M,, according to different
requirements to achieve the given task. Different M, and
My sets can obtain different combinations of DKCs. In
future work, we will study the total number of configura-
tions that can be obtained to form a unified calculation
method.

4.4 Fold-Extension Ratio

Figure 18 shows three DKCs that are extended to connect
to an object. It is interesting to determine the benefits
of the multiarm robot mechanism in deployable opera-
tions. In Figure 18, the structure of each DKC is the same
except the releasable joint at the end. Next, we will study
the relationship between the reachable space of DKC and
the size of the mechanism in folding.

spaces of DKCs-2, 3, 4 are projected to the plane X=0
and Y=0, and the result is shown in the Figure 20.

Figure 21 is the top view of the reachable space projec-
tion. In this figure, the red points are the points in reach-
able space. The black circle is the measuring circle with
r= 100, 200, 300, 400 mm. The yellow circle is the effec-
tive circle, and its radius is the distance between the min-
imum reachable point and the center point.

For the traditional deployable mechanism, the fold-
extension ratio is an evaluation index. While consider-
ing the deployable mechanism proposed in this paper, its
deployable operation primarily enables the multiarm to
have the motions of extension and folding. Therefore, the
comparison between the reachable space of the DKC and
Zhao et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:70

the size of the mechanism in the folding state can be used
as the evaluation index of the fold-extension ratio of the
mechanism proposed in this paper.

Figure 22 is the fold-extension ratio of the multi-
armed robot. The stacking size is the size occupied by
the mechanism itself in the folding state, that is, the
distance between the axis of the first joint of DKC1 and
DKC3. The working range is the distance between the
boundaries of the effective circles of DKC2 and DKC4.
As it can be observed in Figure 22, the range of stacking
size is [— 200, 200]; therefore, the length is 400 mm. The
working range is [—480, 480]; therefore, its length is 960
mm. The ratio of stacking size to the work range is 1:2.4.
Therefore, the fold-extension ratio is equal to 1:2.4. In the
longitudinal direction, the mechanism can expand from
0 to 180 mm. Consequently, the mechanism has a good
deployable performance. It can certainly optimize the
occupied volume during transportation and has multi-
function operation performance.

5 Conclusions

1) A methodology for the design of the multiarm robot
mechanisms with DKCs was presented. The princi-
ple of construction was demonstrated by combining
the DKCs and operation. The operation mode can be
switched based on the DKCs and self-assembly can
be performed.

2) A series of DKCs were obtained by the constraint
conditions of the designated area and the DOFs of
the single-arm mechanism. The DKC is a good choice
to design the multiarm robot mechanisms with cer-
tain advantages.

3) Type-I and Type-II robot mechanisms with four
arms were obtained based on the combination design
method. The proposed multiarm robot mechanisms
retain the original functions of the traditional multi-
arm robot mechanisms; moreover, it demonstrates
the exclusive performance of the DKCs.

4) Fold-extension ratio was discussed and calculated,
and the result demonstrated that the mechanism can
optimize the occupied volume during transportation
and has multifunction operation performance.
