Introduction

In recent years, the need for non-Japanese people to learn the Japanese language has
spread in the world, for the purposes of tourism, studying abroad, and seeking employ-
ment in Japan. According to the Survey on Japanese-Language Education Abroad (The
Japan Foundation, 2019), the number of learners of Japanese as a foreign language
(JFL) has increased by 30.2 times from 1979 to 2018. Mandarin and Korean are two
languages in which two verbs can be combined to form a compound verb; there are
also compound verbs in Japanese (Isobe, Okabe, & Kido, 2018). Compound verbs
represent the concatenation of single verbs; the first single verb in a compound verb
always appears in the adnominal form. Moreover, the meanings are established by the
interaction between the meanings of the single verbs. For example, The compound
verb yobi-kakeru is formed from the single verbs yobu and kakeru. The single verb
yobu means “call” and kakeru means “hang”, however, the meanings of compound verb
yobi-kakeru are “call out” and “urge”. In this study, we will refer to the first single verb

as V1 and the second single verb as V2. Compound verbs frequently appear in daily life,
but are difficult to learn for JFL learners (Kanzaki & Isahara, 2019; Matsuda, 2000, 2002).

Matsuda (2002) and Sano (2004) found two difficulties relating to compound verb ac-
quisition: (1) lack of clarity of verb combinations, and (2) the opacity of the compound
verb meanings. The clarity of the combination plays a vital role in the judgment of
combined compound verb’s existence, such as which two single verbs can compose a
compound verb, and the correct combination order (i.e. V1-V2 or V2-V1). The reason
for the opacity is that the meanings of a compound verb are not simply the combined
meaning of V1 and V2; numerous compound verbs are polysemous, and have their
own meaning. Therefore, the meaning of a compound verb cannot be easily inferred
(Matsuda, 2002). Due to the difficulties of acquiring compound verbs, they are difficult
for learners to comprehend and retain (Chen, 2007; Sano, 2004).

Cognitive linguistics (CL) is essential for exploring the modeling and connections of
linguistics structures, with conceptual knowledge and communicative function (Gibbs,
2006). Extensive CL research has been performed to understand the characteristics of
words (e.g., Bolinger, 1977). Matsuda (2001) proposed image schemas of Japanese com-
pound verbs by applying the core theory and image schema of cognitive linguistics to
Japanese language education. The image schemas of compound verbs are frequently
utilized in compound verb instruction; one image schema is employed to comprehend
the meanings of a compound verb. However, one particular concern is that the simplifica-
tion of the image schemas may make it difficult for learners to understand them, as image
schemas are composed of abstract arrows and graphics (Tagawa & Yuizono, 2016). Sato
(2016) noted that, instead of directly offering image schemas to learners, presenting visual
glosses that are dynamic images, 3D animation, and visual explanations in multimedia
environments will lead to improved learning effectiveness. For example, using 3D anima-
tions, instead of image schema, to learn target vocabulary (Sato, 2016).

The advancement of new technologies has brought new opportunities for language
acquisition. Augmented Reality (AR) is defined as the system which has the ability to
combines real and virtual, interactive in real-time, and registered in three-dimension
(3D) (Azuma, 1997). It has a vital role in the way that language is acquired (Santos
et al., 2013). AR is a graphic technology that provides interactive visual glosses of
concepts to users (Billinghurst & Duenser, 2012). AR provides attached information re-
garding the learning material to enhance the learner’s attention toward relevant visual
information, and improve the ability to physically interact with the learning materials
and observe digital feedback regarding behaviors that may support the learner in un-
derstanding abstract concepts (Fan, Antle, & Warren, 2020). The advantages of annota-
tions of the real world, visualization of context, and vision-haptic visualization make
the usage of AR promising for learning and teaching of abstract concepts and complex
problem effectively, and it shows strong potential as a new educational tool related to
the objects in the real world (Santos et al., 2013; Walczak, Wojciechowski, & Cellary,
2006). For example, Ibrahim et al. (2018) found that learning performance of AR in
which words were displayed for real world objects was significantly higher than the
learning performance of flashcards in a recall test. Thus, AR technology has significant
potential to play a crucial role in facilitating language learning. In this study, we
employed an AR compound verb learning system based on image schema and AR

animations to support learners in acquiring compound verbs.
Geng and Yamada Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:27 Page 3 of 19

Cognitive load is assumed to be related to the learners’ working memory capacity
(Paas & Sweller, 2014). Since the working memory capacity of learners is limited,
instructional design and learning materials might impact how learners interact with
the learning environment and experience the way of cognitive load (Lin, Atkinson,
Christopherson, Joseph, & Harrison, 2013; Paas & Sweller, 2014). Therefore, it indi-
cates a need to explore the relationship between the learning method that includes
learning materials and the perceived cognitive load of the learners.

This paper is organized as follows: Section literature review presents reviews of image
schemas, AR for language acquisition, and cognitive load. In research questions, we
describe the purpose of this study and point out the research questions. Section devel-
opment of the AR compound verb learning system describes the AR learning system
and its functions. Section methods describes the methodology of this study. Section
results we describe the results of Learning performance, cognitive load, the correlation
of changes in learning performance and cognitive load. Section discussions were held
along three research questions. The final of the article, we concludes the paper and
describes future work.

Literature review

Image schemas

Image schemas are a crucial concept of CL. They are a structural representation of
various experiences, based on the orientation, movement, and interaction of our bodies.
Schemas are a pattern of our physical experiences, and are important mediators
between language and concepts. They are useful for understanding both literal and
figurative meanings (Sato, 2016). For example, the image schema of “in” is the mode of
the container, which is used to indicate that something contains something.

Image schemas are frequently utilized instructions in language acquisition (e.g. Tyler,
2004). Benjamin (2012) and Mitsugi (2017) investigated the effectiveness of image
schema based instruction (ISBI) in language teaching. For example, in research,
teachers let learners of English as a second language use their imagination to draw
image schemas of phrase verbs. This reduced learners’ confusion about the use of
phrase verbs (Benjamin, 2012). The current ISBI is mainly used for English acquisition,
but Matsuda (2001) suggested that image schemas could be applied to Japanese
language education. As shown on the right side of Fig. 1, as it was originally applied for
linguists to semantic analysis, the image schema only consists of simple graphics and
arrows. Therefore, it is possible that in a multimedia environment, visual gloss will be
easier to understand and more effective for second language learning than paper-based
materials (Sato, 2016), rather than directly presenting the image schemas to learners
(Tagawa & Yuizono, 2016).

AR for language acquisition

With the popularity of mobile devices and the advancement of technology, various new
learning methods have become possible due to the combination of new technologies.
AR is a graphics technology that allows learners to experience quickly and efficiently,
without wearing special equipment such as a head-mounted display. The three features
of the AR system are, a combination of real and virtual, real-time interaction, and

registered in 3D (Azuma, 1997), which allow for a simultaneous combination of real-
world and virtual objects (Sin & Zaman, 2010; Ibanez et al., 2016). AR can effectively
support the learning of abstract and complex content, meaning that it has the potential

to greatly improve learning performance (Chiu, DeJaegher, & Chao, 2015). There are
three main advantages of AR learning experiences - annotations of the real world,
visualization of context, and vision-haptic visualization (Santos et al., 2013). AR can
provide better learning performance than traditional learning methods by using virtual
objects integrated into the real environment (Santos et al., 2016). AR improves elabor-
ation by employing more meaningful cues for users to see in the real world. Further-
more, AR can also integrate both perceived visual images and touch, to present visual
information.

AR is generally categorized as comprising location-based and image-based systems
(Cheng & Tsai, 2013). Location-based AR systems utilize data related to the location of
mobile devices. Image-based AR systems, however, focus on image recognition technol-
ogy, which is used to determine the correct position of virtual content, relative to physical
objects in the real environment. The application developed in this research employs an
image-based system, with animations displayed on verb cards which is the real text of the
verb. Thus, this application is allowed to enhance the learner’s familiarity with the verb by
the interaction with the verb cards during the learning process.

Language acquisition research using AR has also been performed (e.g., Boonbrahm,
Kaewrat, & Boonbrahm, 2015; Hsu, 2017; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Mahadzir & Phung,
2013; Santos et al., 2016). As an example of an application for learning English as a for-
eign language, Boonbrahm et al. (2015) created a marked-based AR application to learn
Geng and Yamada Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:27 Page 5 of 19

the spellings and meanings of animal-related words; the learners can arrange letters to
form a word that matches the name of an animal, and the 3D animal will be displayed.
Mahadzir and Phung (2013) designed an AR pop-up book to assist primary school
students in Malaysia in learning English by scanning the material through webcams. A
recent study by Ibrahim et al. (2018) described an AR application to support people
learning foreign languages. Their approach focused on using Microsoft HoloLens, and
the learners must move to scan the learning objects placed in the room to learn the
meaning and pronunciation of objects in a foreign language. AR facilitates the presenta-
tion of visual information, which provides the crucial conditions for language acquisi-
tion and allows learners to physically interact with the materials (Fan et al., 2020). AR
as multimedia can potentially improve the learning performance of language learners
(e.g., Hsu, 2017; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Mahadzir & Phung, 2013; Santos et al., 2016).
According to the multimedia effects and spatial and temporal contiguity principle of
multimedia learning theory (Mayer, 2009), words that are presented using both text
and photos are more likely to be learned than words that are presented using text
alone. Because AR has the three advantages—providing annotations of the real world,
visualizing context, and providing vision-haptic visualization, AR can be annotated by
attaching learning objects to the virtual content. Therefore, a study has posited that
learning with AR by annotating objects is better than learning about the same object by
using other materials, such as paper-based textbooks (Santos et al., 2013). Moreover,
displaying information simultaneously beside the object in the real world allows
learners to integrate the object and the surrounding spatial information, thus providing
learners with cues to remember as well as allowing memories to be retained for longer
periods. For example, handheld AR systems for vocabulary learning in the Filipino and
German languages were developed by Santos et al. (2016), and the study results
indicate that the usage of handheld AR improved word retention.

Cognitive load

Cognitive load theory (CLT) involves working memory capacity and long-term mem-
ory. It indicates that cognitive load is related to the learner’s working memory capacity,
and instructional design should integrate human cognitive structures due to the limited
capacity of working memory (Paas & Sweller, 2014). Three categories are included in
CLT, namely, extraneous cognitive load, intrinsic cognitive load, and germane cognitive
load (Sweller, 2010). The intrinsic cognitive load is related to the complexity of infor-
mation, the extraneous cognitive load is caused by the instructional design, whereas the
germane cognitive load is related to the acquisition of knowledge (Sweller, 2010).
Instructional design and learning materials can affect the way that learners interact
with the learning environment and experience the cognitive load (Lin et al., 2013; Paas
& Sweller, 2014). CLT, which is one of the most important theories that instructional
designers must consider, identifies the cognitive processes that users engage in when
using technology (Ibili, 2019). Therefore, examining the cognitive load of AR instruc-
tions is a crucial task. For example, Lai, Chen, and Lee (2019) developed a multimedia
learning system designed with AR that significantly reduced the extraneous cognitive
load. However, Akcayir and Akgayir (2017) conducted a systematic review, and showed
two contradictory results: one asserted that AR systems decreased cognitive load,
Geng and Yamada Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:27 Page 6 of 19

whereas the other one asserted that they increased cognitive load. Based on the multi-
media learning theory and CLT, an AR system can reduce the cognitive load of limited
working memory by providing memory cues. On the other hand, receiving significant
amounts of information during a short period will increase the cognitive load on
learners (Cheng & Tsai, 2013). Therefore, examining the cognitive load of AR systems
is a crucial task.

The spatial continuity principle proposed by Mayer (2002) indicated that words pre-
sented using both text and photos are learned with increased effectiveness and reduced
cognitive load, compared with words that are presented using only text in a multimedia
learning environment. Because AR is a technology wherein the real world and virtual
objects are presented together, AR instructions can serve as a symbolic representation
between abstract and concrete concepts; thus, AR instructions can facilitate learning by
extending the learning content from the abstract to the concrete, thereby reducing the
cognitive load of the learner (ibili, 2019). Santos et al. (2013) noted that AR provides
interactions with information that can help learners to facilitate the perception and
memorization of information. In addition, as a feature of an AR system, real-world an-
notations can reduce the cognitive load for learners, thus leading to improved learning.
On the other hand, some ineffective instructional designs can cause the split-attention
effect, such as text not being within the same page as the target image, thereby increas-
ing the learner’s need for working memory, and potentially increasing the cognitive
load and negatively impacting learning (Sweller, 2010). Hence, it is crucial to probe the

cognitive load of AR learning environments to investigate learning performance.

Research questions

In this study, we designed an AR learning system based on the image schema of cogni-
tive linguistics for acquiring Japanese compound verbs, in order to support compound
verb learning. Moreover, we conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of
paper-based image schema material and AR learning systems on learners’ learning per-
formance and cognitive load. Therefore, we set the following three research questions:

Research Question 1: Do the learners of the two learning methods (AR learning
system and paper-based image schema material) differ in their learning performance?
Research Question 2: Do the learners of the two learning methods differ in their
perceived cognitive load?

Research Question 3: Are the cognitive loads perceived by the learners related to their

learning performance in each learning method?

Development of the AR compound verb learning system

In this study, based on our previous research (Geng & Yamada, 2019), we developed an
AR compound verb learning system to support learners’ compound verb learning. In
this system, the meanings of verbs, including both single verbs and compound verbs,
were represented by 3D animations created using Maya, according to the image sche-
mas of the verbs. Maya is a 3D computer graphics software, and it is used to create
interactive 3D animations and visual effects. Figure 1 depicts how the image schemas
were converted into the character actions of the animations. For example, the graphics
Geng and Yamada Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:27 Page 7 of 19

of the image schemas were converted into characters and objects; arrows were con-
verted into actions and motions. In this way, the meanings of verbs were shown to
learners by the 3D animations. The animations were also evaluated by five Japanese na-
tive speakers (including two Japanese-language teachers) to confirm the validity of the
semantic explanation of the animation. Specifically, we presented each animation to
each evaluator and asked them to judge whether the meaning of the animations pro-
duced was matched its Japanese meaning using the 5-point Likert scale (i.e. 1 - not at
all, 5 - very much). We also interviewed them about their comments on each anima-
tion. The animations with the average score below 4 were revised according to the
comments of evaluators. The animated verbs comprised 19 verbs (including single and
compound verbs) that were extracted from the vocabulary list of the N2 and N3 levels
Japanese-Language Proficiency Test. Moreover, the image schemas of the verbs were
created by Matsuda (2004) and Matsuda and Shiraishi (2011).

The system was designed based on marker-based AR, and was composed of a set of
verb cards and an application for smartphones. One set of cards comprised 11 cards
that were printed with the characters of the single verbs (e.g., Fig. 2). In this system, the
learners can scan the verb card, and then the animation will be displayed on the card
through the screen of the smartphone in the application. The application was developed
using Unity 3D and Vuforia. Additionally, the combination function was developed based
on the V1 + V2 strategy (Matsuda, 2004) in order to support learners to learn compound
verbs. As shown in Fig. 3, learners can first learn single verbs via scanning the verb cards,
and can then correctly combine the verb cards of V1 and V2 to learn compound verbs
composed of V1 and V2. In detail, the application will recognize the number of cards in
the camera interface, and judge the combination and order of these verb cards if the
number of cards is two. The animations of the compound verbs will be displayed if the
two verb cards can be successfully combined into a compound verb.

On the other hand, the following functions of the system were designed to aid the diffi-
culties of acquiring compound verbs: (1) lack of clarity of verb combinations: the judg-
ment function was designed to present right or wrong verb combinations. When the
learner combines the two verb cards, if the combination of the verb order is not correct,

or these two verbs do not form a compound verb, the application will deliver the message:

compound verb meanings: by combining the verb cards, the meanings of the single verbs
and compound verbs are compared, making it possible for learners to distinguish the dif-
ference between their meanings. For example, when learners use a single card of V1, the
screen shows the animation of V1, but by combining the verb cards V1 and V2, the appli-
cation will show an animation of the compound verb V1-V2 (see Fig. 3). In this way, by
scanning individual cards and card combinations, it is possible to distinguish between

the meaning of the single verb and the compound verb it can form.

Methods

Participants

Twenty-one students from a Japanese language school in Japan were recruited for this
study; they were aged 18—25 years. The nationalities of the participants were Chinese,
Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai, all of whom were non-native Japanese speakers. There
were 12 male participants and nine female participants. In addition, the Japanese-
language level of the participants were all over N3, which means that they could under-
stand the explanations of the verbs provided in the experiment. The N3 level is a
junior-intermediate level of the Japanese language. Although learners at this level are
able to understand Japanese used in everyday situations to a certain degree, they do not
have much knowledge concerning compound verbs. Twenty-one participants were ran-
domized to the experimental (7=10) and control groups (1 =11). The experimental
group conducted the learning activity with the AR system and materials, whereas the
control group conducted the learning activity only using the materials. The materials of
the experimental group only contained explanations and example sentences of the
verbs, but the materials of the image schema group consisted of the image schemas of
the verbs, their explanations, and example sentences. Except for the image schemas of
the verbs, the learning content, explanations, and example sentences of the two groups

of materials were the same.

Experimental procedure

In this study, we conducted a 90-min experiment that was aimed to enhance the learn-
ing effectiveness of learners’ compound verbs. The experimental procedure is shown in
Fig. 4. Firstly, all participants took a pre-test before the learning activity, to evaluate
their knowledge of compound verbs and single verbs. As shown in Fig. 5, the experi-
mental group adopted the AR learning system to learn single verbs and compound
verbs via scanning and combining single verbs during the learning activity. In addition,
the experimental group also utilized materials containing explanations and example
sentences to understand the meanings of the verbs. The control group only used the
material to learn Japanese verbs. All participants implemented the learning activity for
40 min. After the learning activity, all participants conducted a post-test and filled out
the cognitive load questionnaire and the post questionnaire. Four weeks later, all of the

participants conducted a delayed test.

Measuring tools

The measuring tools used in this experiment included the pre-test, post-test, delay-test,
cognitive load questionnaire, and post questionnaire. To assess learners’ knowledge of
compound verbs and single verbs, we designed the pre-test, post-test, and delayed test.
Each test consisted of two parts, comprising 15 true or false questions for examining
the combinations of compound verbs, and 26 multiple-choice questions for testing the
meanings of the verbs. These three tests are composed of the same questions and
options from the question pool for single and compound verbs. However, the order of
the questions and options in all three tests varied (see Additional file 1). Each test had

a total score of 41 points, with one point per question. In addition, an expert teacher

the test questions.

The cognitive load questionnaire was created by Leppink, Paas, Van der Vleuten, Van
Gog, and Van Merriénboer (2013). It measures the learners’ extraneous cognitive load,
intrinsic cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. The intrinsic cognitive load is re-
lated to the complexity of information, the extraneous cognitive load is related to the
design of material, and the germane cognitive load is related to the acquisition of
knowledge (Sweller, 2010). The questionnaire was conducted using an 11-point Likert
scoring scheme. The intrinsic cognitive load comprised three items (e.g., “The com-
pound verbs covered in the activity were very complex.”). The extraneous cognitive
load was made up of three items, such as “The instructions and explanations during
the activity were very unclear”; moreover, the germane cognitive load comprised four
items (for example “The activity really enhanced my understanding of the compound
verbs.”). The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient values described via the original survey were
0.81, 0.75, and 0.82 for intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive load, and germane
cognitive load, respectively, which shows that the method that Leppink used to assess
students’ cognitive load had high intrinsic consistency reliability (Leppink et al., 2013).
The post questionnaire contained some questions about learners’ impressions after
using materials and systems. The questionnaire asked participants to complete two
open-ended questions which are “write your impressions of using the system” and
“write what could be improved (or difficult to use) about the system.” We recorded and

collated the responses to the questionnaire from all participants.

Results

Learning performance

Table 1 presents the median, mean, and standard deviation (SD) values of the total
scores in the pre-test, post-test, and delayed test for participants in the experimental
and control groups. From Table 1, it is found that the total scores of the post-test and
delayed test were higher than the pre-test in each group. Since the sample size was
small and not normally distributed, the non-parametric analysis was used in this study.
First, we conducted the Friedman test to compare the total scores of the three tests in
the experimental group and the control group. The results were significant differences

between the total scores of the three tests in the two groups (experimental group: y7 =
14.37, p<0.01 control group: y” = 8.750, p< 0.05). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were
conducted to evaluate whether the total-score was different between each of the two
tests. We also calculated the effect size r. The results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
are shown in Table 2. In both groups, significant differences were observed in the total
scores between the pre-test and post-test (experimental group: | Z | = 2.677, p< 0.01,
r = 0.85; control group: | Z | = 2.668, p < 0.01, r= 0.80). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the
experimental and control groups’ mean values and medians of the total scores im-
proved from the pre-test to post-test, at a significance value of 0.01. The results all
show a large effect size. This shows that there was a statistical difference in learners’
learning performance after completing the learning activity. Furthermore, there was a
statistically significant difference between the pre-test and the delay-test scores in the
experimental group (|Z] = 1.963, p < 0.05, r = 0.62). There was also a statistically signifi-
cant difference between the post-test and delay-test scores in each group (experimental
group: | Z | = 2.051, p < 0.05, r = 0.85; control group: | Z | = 2.439, p< 0.01, r = 0.74).
Table 3 shows the summary statistics for the median, mean, and SD values of the
scores of parts one and two in the pre-test, post-test, and delay-test, for the experimen-
tal and control groups. The questions of part one were designed to examine combina-
tions of the compound verbs, whereas part two was designed to examine the learners’
knowledge of the meanings of single verbs and compound verbs. To compare the dif-
ferences between the experimental and control groups for part one and part two in
each test, we conducted the Friedman tests. Concerning the scores of part one, there
were significant differences on all three tests in the two groups (experimental group:
x’ = 15.84, p< 0.01 control group: x’ = 16.70, p< 0.01). Significant differences were also
found in the results of Part two (experimental group: y7 = 12.47, p < 0.01 control group:
x’ = 15.85 p<0.01). The results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are shown in Table 4.
There was a significant difference in scores for part one between the pre-test and post-
test in the experimental group (| Z | = 2.816, p< 0.01, r=0.89). Conversely, no statisti-
cally significant difference in the part one scores was found between the pre-test and
post-test in the control group, at a significance value of 0.05 (| Z | =1.196, p< 0.1, r=
0.36). Furthermore, it was found that the part one scores of the delayed test were

(| Z | =2.159, p< 0.05, r=0.69), while corresponding significant difference was evident
between the pre-test and delayed test (| Z | =1.029, p>0.1, r=0.31). Regarding part
two, the post-test scores were significantly higher than the of the pre-test scores in both
the experimental and control groups (AR group: | Z | = 2.106, p< 0.05, r= 0.67; image
schema group: | Z | = 2.658, p< 0.01, r=0.80). Interestingly, only for the control group
were the part two scores of the delayed test significantly higher than the pre-test scores
(| Z | = 1.965, p< 0.05, r= 0.59).

In order to verify the differences in learning performance between the experimental
and control groups, we analyzed the test scores using Mann-Whitney U tests. The
results of the Mann-Whitney U tests are shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, none

of the differences in scores between the two groups were statistically significant.

Cognitive load

In this study, the cognitive load questionnaire was divided into three categories: extra-
neous cognitive load, intrinsic cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. To verify the
reliability of the survey, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient values were 0.666, 0.674, and
0.871 for the external, internal, and germane cognitive loads, respectively. In addition,
Mann-Whitney U tests were used to probe the influences of the AR learning system
and the paper-based image schema materials on the learners’ cognitive load. As shown
in Table 6, the mean intrinsic cognitive load and germane cognitive load values of the
experimental group were higher than those of the control group. The mean of the ex-
traneous cognitive load was lower for the experimental group than for the control

group. However, no statistical difference was found for the three categories of cognitive
loads between the experimental and control groups.

Changes in learning performance and cognitive load

In order to investigate whether the perceived cognitive load influenced the learning
performance, correlation analyses using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were
executed to assess the correlations between changes in learning performance and the
cognitive load of the experimental and control groups. According to the results of
Table 7, in the experimental group, there was a moderate negative correlation between
learners’ changes in the delayed and pre-tests (delayed test score-pre-test score) and
intrinsic cognitive load (p = 0.563, p< 0.1). On the other hand, as shown in Table 8, a
strong negative correlation was found between changes in the post-tests and delayed
tests (delayed test score - post-test score) and the extraneous cognitive load. There was
also a strong positive correlation between the changes in post-tests and delay tests and

germane cognitive load.

Discussion

Research question 1: do the learners of the two learning methods (AR learning system
and paper-based image schema material) differ in their learning performance?

The results of this experiment indicate that both the learners using the AR learning
system and the learners using the paper-based materials significantly enhanced their
learning performance. In particular, the AR learning system was more effective regard-
ing the retention of knowledge. These findings were also supported by the previous

study (e.g., Santos et al., 2016). Santos et al. (2016) designed two handheld AR systems
for Filipino and German vocabulary learning, and proposed that AR improves the re-
tention of words via evaluation experiments. One possible explanation for this might be
that AR can effectively promote learning and long-term retention by increasing the size
of the chunks of working memory (Squires, 2017). AR technology can attach extra in-
formation to the real-world view of the learners, and can then release part of the work-
ing memory to recall knowledge, to support new experiences and tasks in complex
environments (Proctor and Zandt, 2018). The AR learning system of this study seemed
to improve perception through verb cards, which are real world annotations used to
reduce the load on the learners’ limited working memory. This meant that a larger
proportion of the short-term memory would have been used for their knowledge of the
verbs (Santos et al., 2013).

Regarding the difficulties of compound verb acquisition, we designed two parts of the
tests. Regarding the results of part one, compared with the learning method of the
image schema materials, the AR learning system greatly aided learners in improving
their learning of the combination of compound verbs. This could be explained by the
design of the judgment function that presents the correctness of each verb combin-
ation. On the other hand, the learners using the image schema materials better retained
the meanings of the verbs than the AR system learners. This could be explained by the
following feedback of the post-questionnaire:

"I want the explanations and animations of the verbs to appear on the same

screen.”

Due to the spatial contiguity principle of the multimedia learning theory, integrating
the explanation and AR animation on the same screen might lead to better learning
performance (Mayer, 2002). Regarding the paper-based material, the explanation of the
meaning and the image schemas were on the same page, thus the paper-based material
might have been more effective for learning the meanings of the verbs in this experi-
ment. Based on the above, we found that the AR learning system was more effective for

learning verb combinations, while paper-based material was more effective for com-
pound verb meaning. This provides ISBI with a new proposal that utilizes the features
of AR to design functions to overcome the difficulties of language acquisition. More-
over, it should be noted that the AR system might not have a better learning effective-
ness than the paper-based materials, as we need to consider the multimedia design
principles when using AR to design instructional materials.

Another result of the learning performance was that there was no significant differ-
ence in the learning scores between the two learning methods. This is consistent with
results of previous research (Sato, 2016), which suggested that there was no significant
difference between the learning effects of animated glosses and pictorial glosses in
learning English polysemous words. The result can likely be attributed to the fact that
the participants’ Japanese levels were too high - the mean value of the two groups’ pre-
tests score exceeded 70% of the perfect score (see Table 1). This is an important issue
for future research. Further research needs to be done to adjust for the Japanese lan-
guage proficiency of participants and the difficulty of the tests. On the other hand, due
to the small effect size of these results, we need to validate the experimental results
again in future work.

In the post-questionnaire, participants provided the following comments regarding
the AR learning system: “easy to understand,” “animations of the verbs were easy to re-
member,” and “useful for learning.” The findings show that the AR system was per-
ceived as being increasingly effective, compared with paper-based instruction. Although
preliminary, our experiments suggest that AR may lead to increased perceived useful-
ness. For AR learning systems, scanning or combining cards to learn the meaning of
the single and compound verbs is an easy task and is perceived to be part of a useful
learning environment. Therefore, conducting further analyses of the reasons for in-
creasing perceived usefulness is a crucial task. Future research must use learning ana-
lytics to confirm the relationship among these behaviors in the real world (e.g.,
combination and scanning for verb cards), as well as to analyze the perceived usefulness

and learning performance.

Research question 2: do the learners of the two learning methods differ in their
perceived cognitive load?

While the intrinsic and germane cognitive loads of learners who used the AR system
were higher than that of the paper-based materials learners, their extrinsic cognitive
load was lower than that of the paper-based materials learners; however, there was no
significant difference in the three categories of the cognitive loads between the two
learning manners in this study. This finding was unexpected, and suggests that the per-
ceived cognitive loads using animations of the AR system were equivalent to paper-
based image schemas. This result may be due to the split-attention effect (Sweller,
2010), which is caused by the spatial separation of the AR system and the verb explan-
ation materials. Although AR systems can reduce cognitive load by providing cues of
memory (Santos et al., 2013), non-intuitive AR system design and decentralized learn-
ing information will increase learners’ cognitive load (Ibili, 2019; Van Merrienboer,
Kester, & Paas, 2006). Therefore, the results of this study are different from those of an
AR system developed by the principle of continuity of multimedia (Lai et al., 2019).
Geng and Yamada Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:27 Page 16 of 19

Lai et al. (2019) instead found that their AR system reduced the perceived cognitive
load of learners. We propose that instructional materials using AR should be designed
to employ the split-attention effect and the continuity principle of multimedia to
reduce extraneous cognitive loads. For example, explanations of the verbs and AR
animations will be integrated on the same screen of the application and displayed at

the same time.

Research question 3: are the cognitive loads perceived by the learners related to the
learning performance in each learning method?

Concerning the correlation between the learning performance and perceived cognitive
load, it can be found that the lower the intrinsic cognitive load of the learners using the
AR learning system the better the retention of knowledge according to the results in
Table 7. Intrinsic cognitive load is caused by the number of interacting information ele-
ments contained in the learning task or learning material (Sweller, 2010). Thus, learners
with low intrinsic load require less working memory to be able to store information
into long-term memory compared to learners with high intrinsic load (Leppink, Paas,
Van Gog, van Der Vleuten, & Van Merrienboer, 2014).

Conversely, correlation was observed among learners of image schema materials,
which might be explained by the fact that the higher the extraneous cognitive load per-
ceived by the learners, correspondingly, the lower the germane cognitive load and the
shorter memory of the verbs retained. This finding was consistent with the CLT, which
purposed that as the extraneous cognitive load increases, the germane cognitive load
will decrease (Schnotz & Kiirschner, 2007). Sweller (2010) asserted that the extraneous
cognitive load and intrinsic cognitive load are additive, and that the total load cannot
exceed available resources. If many resources were to be allocated to the extraneous
cognitive load, then little resources would be allocated to the working memory. There-
fore, it will be difficult to transform from short-term memory to long-term memoty,
regarding learning contents (Galy & Mélan, 2013). We suppose that regarding the
paper-based image schema materials, only simple graphics and explanations were pro-
vided to learners. Too much information needed to be perceived, making the working
memory insufficient, thus it was even harder to keep memory to be retained than for
the AR system. According to Tables 2 and 6, the extraneous cognitive load was higher
for the paper-based material, and the germane cognitive load was lower. There were
also larger changes in the delayed test and post-test for the paper-based material.

Conclusions and future work

In this study, we designed and developed an AR learning system based on image
schema for acquiring Japanese compound verbs. The results of our study indicate that
both of the learning methods enhanced the learning performance of the learners. The
AR learning system greatly supported learners to improve their learning of the combin-
ation of compound verbs, while the learners who used image schema materials better
retained the meaning of verbs. This result might be related to the principle of continu-
ity of multimedia due to the spatial separation of the AR system and the verb explan-
ation materials. The results of this study confirmed that there was no significant
difference in cognitive load between the two learning methods. They also supported
Geng and Yamada Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:27 Page 17 of 19

the propositions of Van Merrienboer et al. (2006) and Ibili (2019); in that AR system
design is not intuitive, and that decentralized learning information increases the cogni-
tive load. Furthermore, we also found that the perceived cognitive load was related to
learning performance, and was likely to be affected by learner motivation.

These results need to be explored further, because our experiment involved only a
low sample size and the effect sizes related to differences in learning performance be-
tween the two learning methods were too small. The experiment should be adjusted to
suit the Japanese language proficiency of the participants, with a bigger sample size. It
should be noted that this study only compares the AR learning system with paper-
based materials, but not with other visual gloss resources such as animated images. In
future research, we need to take it into account and conduct multi-group experiments.
Furthermore, Schnotz and Kiirschner (2007) pointed out the limitation of the psycho-
metric measures of cognitive load, namely whether learners are really able to clearly
distinguish between different types of cognitive load through introspection. It needs to
be carried out in order to measure the cognitive load by using other ways, such as
behavioral assessment and learning analytics. Regarding the results of this study, one
limitation is the separation of the AR system and the materials. Therefore, further
research is required to establish the learning performance and cognitive load of inte-
grating explanations and AR animations on the same screen. A further issue that was
not addressed in this study was the relationship between learning performance and the
learning process of the AR system. In future studies, we will design the learning path
visualization function to clarify these relationships.
