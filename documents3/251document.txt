1 Introduction

The conventional index analysis method adopts a statistical method to make a general
analysis of sports training indicators. When analyzing niche data, due to the small
amount of statistical data, conventional methods have the disadvantage of low compre-
hensive analysis capabilities [1, 2]. Therefore, the application of data mining technology
in the analysis of sports training index is proposed in this paper. According to the
characteristics of the data set, the classification of index parameters was determined,
then the sports training analysis mechanism was established by importing data mining
technology, and the analysis model was constructed. By analyzing the three processes
of data preparation, data mining, and result interpretation, the data mining results of
training indicators are obtained and data analysis is completed. Finally, the data mining
technology is applied in the analysis of sports training indicators. In the simulation test
environment, two different methods were used for coverage test, accuracy test, and

2 Construction of the analysis model for sports training indicators

2.1 Import of data mining technology

Determining the index parameters is based on the characteristics of the data set to find
the concept description of the category which represents the overall information of
such data, that is, the intension description of the category. The purpose of the classifi-
cation is to analyze the input data. Through the characteristics represented by the data,
the accurate description is found for each type of data; such description is often
expressed as a predicate, and it is used to classify the subsequent data. Although the
class labels for these data are unknown, their categories can still be predicted [3].

The classification can be described as follows: Given a set T of training data, where
the element record is described by several attributes, there is only one attribute as a
class attribute in all the attributes. This set is represented by a vector X = (XJ, X2....,
Xn), where Xi (1 < i < n) represents a non-category attribute and may have different
ranges. When the value range of the attribute is continuous, the attribute is called a
continuous attribute; otherwise, it is called the discrete attribute. C = {C1,C2,...,C;,} rep-
resents the data set with k different categories of attributes. Then, the T determines a
mapping function from vector X to C, that is, . The purpose of the classification is to
use data mining techniques to express the implicit function H. The expression of the
function H is as follows [4]:

H = pH, + log(a" + ef) (1)

In which H represents the implicit function, Hp represents the initial state of the func-
tion, p represents the defining attribute of the function, a represents the range of the
element record, nm represents the range of the condition, e represents the range of the
sports index, and f represents the discrete index of the sports index. Index parameter
classification is generally divided into two steps: The first step is to import data mining
technology through known data sets. The second step is to use the obtained model for
the classification operation.

First, the accuracy of model classification is estimated. If the accuracy of the model is
acceptable, the model can be used for classification. The first step, as shown in Fig. 1, is

to use the trai: f(X) — Cning data set for learning. Training sets are analyzed by clas-
sification algorithms to generate classification rules.

Second, the test data is used to evaluate the model as shown in Fig. 2. If the accuracy
rate is acceptable, the classification rules will be used to classify the new data.

Data mining methods are developed from artificial intelligence and machine learning
methods, which combine statistical analysis methods, fuzzy mathematical methods, and
scientific computing visualization techniques. Data mining technology can be divided
into the following six categories.

Inductive learning is currently the focus of research, and it is mainly divided into two
categories: information theory and set theory. The information theory approach uses
information theory to establish a decision tree. In the field of sports training analysis,
the decision tree is a simple index representation method. It gradually classifies cases
into different categories. This kind of method has good practical effect and great influ-
ence. Since the method finally obtains a decision tree, it is generally called a decision
tree method. The more distinctive methods in information theory methods are ID3 and
IBLE methods [5]. In recent years, due to the development of the rough set theory, the
set theory method has been rapidly developed. This includes the coverage of positive

exclusion exceptions (AQ method), the concept tree method, and the rough set
method. Their three relationships are shown in Eq. 2 [6].

Typical biomimetic technology methods are neural network methods and genetic al-
gorithms. These two methods have formed an independent research system, and they
have also played a huge role in data mining. The neural network method is based on
the IP model and the Hebb Learning Rule, and the three types of neural network
models are established. The neural network sports training index is a distributed matrix
structure. Neural network learning is reflected in the gradual calculation of neural net-
work weights. Using neural network techniques is particularly effective when it is diffi-
cult to obtain concepts from complex or inaccurate data. The trained neural network is
like an “expert” with some kind of specialized sports training indicators, so it can learn
from experience like people [7].

Genetic algorithm is the algorithm that simulates the process of biological evolution.
It consists of three basic processes of breeding, crossing, and mutating. The algorithm
has played a significant role in optimizing calculations and classifying machine
learning.

From this, it can be seen that certain mathematic operations on several data vari-
ables can get the corresponding mathematical formulas. The statistical analysis
method uses statistical principles to analyze the data. It includes common statistics,
correlation analysis, regression analysis, variance analysis, cluster analysis, and
discriminant analysis [8].

The generation of fuzzy mathematics is due to the objective existence of ambiguity.
And the higher the complexity of the system is, the stronger its ambiguity is. This is
the principle of mutual grammar summarized by Zadeh. The fuzzy set theory can be
used to make fuzzy judgments, fuzzy decisions, fuzzy pattern recognition, fuzzy associ-
ation rules, and fuzzy cluster analysis on practical problems. The expression of the

fuzzy mathematics method is shown in formula 3.

Pi(m) = P21 + Za) (3)
w1%2

In which Pi(m) denotes fuzzy mathematics, and P is the representation of the com-
plexity of the system. Z, represents the fuzzy judgment, Z> is the fuzzy decision, x, rep-
resents the fuzzy pattern recognition, x2 represents the fuzzy cluster, and 1 represents
the fuzzy association rule.

The visual data analysis technology broadened the traditional charting function and
enabled users to analyze the data more clearly, for example, turning multi-dimensional
data into a variety of graphics, which play a very strong role in revealing the inherent
nature and regularity of the data. The purpose is to enable users to browse data and
mining process alternately and improve the effect of mining. This technology plays an
important role in all stages of data mining. In the preparation phase, the source data is
displayed through scatter plots and histograms, which will lay the foundation for better
data selection. In the mining phase, various mining processes are described in the visual

form, and the user can see from which database the data is extracted, how to extract,
Qian and Liu EURASI/P Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:121 Page 5 of 17

how to preprocess, and how to mine. In the presentation phase, the technique makes

the training indicators easier to understand.

2.2 Establishment of training analysis mechanism

Data mining classification techniques include decision trees, Bayesian, neural networks,
and rough sets [9]. This paper mainly studies the decision tree classification method
based on the following considerations.

First, the decision tree method can generate easily understandable rules. Because the
end users are teaching managers, they often do not have the data mining sports train-
ing indicators, so the interpretability of the mining method is very important. The deci-
sion tree represents the final classification result in a tree structure, and it can also

generate If-Then rules. The theoretical expression can be written as follows:

Eo = S (ai-a) (f:-f) -1/ Yew (4)

i=l i=1

In which Epo represents the theoretical expression function, 1 is the calculated length,
a means the element record range, f is the discrete index, and e represents the index
range.

Second, the calculation of the method is not very large. This system is mainly a prac-
tical application, not algorithm research, so the work efficiency is more important. This
method can greatly shorten the time of calculation and improve the system’s execution
efficiency. The efficiency of execution can be written as the following formula [10]:

n

>_ (4-2)

i=1

+ log(a” + ef) (5)

 

 

E=py(a-a(f-F)-1/

In which E is the execution efficiency, and p means the defined attributes of function.
In addition, the decision tree method can handle continuous and discrete data. The
database contains more types of data, not only qualitative attributes but also quantita-
tive attributes. Among them, qualitative attributes account for the majority. The
method works better with discrete data.

Finally, the decision tree can clearly show the importance of attributes. It chooses the
splitting attribute by the calculation of the information entropy, and which is the metric
of the importance of the attribute. From an intuitive point of view, the higher the level
of the node is, the more important the attributes represented by the node are. From an
intuitive point of view, the higher the level of the decision tree node is, the more im-
portant the attributes represented by that node are. Then, the role of the nodes of the
same level is basically the same.

In summary, this paper chooses the decision tree method for the analysis of sports

training index. Its process function can express formula 6 [11].

the split-choice attribute, tT represents the calculation width, and 1 is the range of
conditions.

The decision tree is the process of classifying data through a series of rules, which is the
induction learning algorithm. It infers the classification rules of the decision tree representa-
tion from a set of irregular elements. It adopts the top-down recursive method to compare
attribute values at internal nodes and branch downwards according to different attribute
values. The leaf node is the class to be divided. The path from the root node to the leaf node
corresponds to a classification rule, and the entire tree represents a set of rules.

In Fig. 3, it is seen that the decision tree is a tree structure similar to a flow chart,
which consists of decision nodes, branches, and leaves. Each node corresponds to a
non-category attribute, each branch corresponds to each possible value of the attribute,
and each leaf node of the tree represents a category. The middle node of the tree is
usually represented by a rectangle, while the leaf node is represented by an ellipse. At
present, a variety of decision tree algorithms have been formed, such as CLS, ID3,
CHAID, CART, FACT, C4.5, GINI, SEES, SLIQ, and SPRINT [12]. The most famous
algorithm is the ID3 algorithm proposed by Quinlan.

Figure 4 describes the generation process of the decision tree, which is divided into
learning and testing. The learning phase adopts a top-down recursive approach [13]. The
algorithm is divided into two steps: one is the generation of the tree, and the other is the
pruning of the tree, which is to remove some data that may be noise or abnormal.

The formula for removing noise and abnormal data volume is as follows:

In which L,,(x) represents the amount of noise removed, x represents a series, x; is

sents the decision tree, and 1 means the scope of the condition.

Fig. 4 The decision tree generation

The condition that the decision tree stops splitting is that the data on one node be-

longs to the same category and no attribute can be reused for segmentation. Building
the decision tree can be done by scanning the database several times. This means that
fewer resources are required and that it is easy to handle situations where there are
many predictors. Therefore, the model of the decision tree can be built very quickly
and is suitable for applying to a large amount of data. Through the determination of
index parameter classification, the data mining technology is imported and the analysis

mechanism is established. Finally the model is built.

3 Methods

3.1 The analysis of data mining process

Data mining is a multi-stage process, which mainly includes data preparation, data
mining, and result interpretation. The data mining process of sports training index is
the iterative process of these three phases, as shown in Fig. 5 [14].

Data preparation accounts for the largest proportion of the entire mining process,
usually around 60%. This stage is divided into three steps: data selection, data process-
ing, and data transformation. Data selection mainly refers to the extraction of data from
the database and the formation of target data. Preprocessing is to process the extracted
data so that it meets the requirements. The main purpose of the transformation is to
reduce the data dimension. According to formula 4 and formula 5, the expression of
the initial feature function is as follows [15]:

get data, v means calculation magnitude, 0 is the spelling records, / means mining

the mining of working state, and i represents the data of the ith level.

Data mining is firstly algorithmic planning, such as the discovery of data summary,
classification, clustering and association rules, or discovery of sequence patterns. Then,
the algorithm is selected for this mining method. The choice of the algorithm directly
affects the quality of the mining model. After completing the above preparations, the
algorithms of data mining can be run. This stage is the phase that data mining analysts
and experts are most concerned about. It can also be called data mining in the real
sense and expressed by the following function:

In which D represents the data mining process, M(q) represents the sum of condition
vectors of Eq. 5 and Eq. 6, G(g) represents the sum of state mining state vectors, m,,

status. Ep represents the mining conditions, where geRn, |M(q)| < d, and Es is a con-
stant, M(q) is an inverse matrix, and m,1;N;- cosv;0; f /l(E-E\-E2) = 0|Vx € R”. G(q)|
< d <a, and the integral of the value is a constant.

Data mining tasks include correlation analysis, cluster analysis, classification, predic-
tion, timing model, and deviation detection. Association analysis means that when the
values of two or more data items appear repeatedly and the probability is high, there is
an association between them. The association rules of these data items can be estab-
lished to reflect the correlation between events. If there is an association between mul-
tiple attributes, the attribute value of one can be predicted based on the others, for
example, 90% of customers who buy bread buy milk, which is an association rule. Put-
ting them together will increase their sales. In large databases, there are many such as-
sociation rules, which require them to be screened. Generally, use the values of
“support” and “confidence” to filter the useless rules, which can be expressed by the fol-
lowing formula [16]:

In which 6 represents the useless association rule, L represents the value of the sup-
port, / is the value of confidence, S is the data schedulability, F is the value of the data
attribute, i represents the correlation coefficient, and d represents a motion index
state.

The timing model of data mining refers to searching through the time series for a
pattern with a high probability of recurrence. In this model, it is necessary to find out
the rule that the ratio always exceeds a certain minimum percentage in a certain mini-
mum time [17]. These rules will be adjusted as the situation changes. One of the most
important methods in the model is “similar timing.” Using it, the temporal event data-
base is viewed in chronological order, from which one or more similar temporal events

can be found.

t Ne
w=Fs | (Pi) (11)

In which Y is the similar timing events, Nc represents the data mining time, Fs means
the constant of the sports index, and ¢ represents the data of the sports index.

Data mining clusters data into several categories. The data of the same category are
similar to each other. The distances of different categories of data are relatively large
and different from each other. Clustering includes statistical analysis methods, machine
learning methods, and neural network methods. Statistical analysis is clustering based
Qian and Liu EURASI/P Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:121 Page 10 of 17

on distance. This method is the clustering of global comparison. It needs to examine
all individuals to determine the division of the class. The distance in clustering of the
machine learning is determined according to the concept description, which is called
concept clustering. When the clustering objects increase, concept clustering is called
concept formation. In neural networks, self-organizing neural network methods are
used for clustering. Such as the ART model and Kohonen model, this is the unsuper-
vised learning method [18]. After a given distance threshold, each sample is clustered
according to the threshold. The clustering formula is as follows:

Ns - Ns;
= —— +

A=

(12)

In which J represents the clustering of data mining, Q represents the mining coeffi-
cient, the N means the total amount of mining, the Ns represents the overall amount of
the s-layer, Ns, represents the overall amount of the next layer of the s-layer, and Y is
the similar timing events.

Classification is most widely used in data mining. It is to find the concept description
of the category and use this description to construct the model. The description repre-
sents the overall information of such data, that is, the content description. Connotation
description is divided into feature description and discernment description. Feature de-
scription is the description of common features of data, and discriminatory description
is the description of the difference between them. The process of classification is to
analyze the input data, find an accurate description for each class by calculating the
characteristics of the data, and use this description to classify the subsequent data [19].

Deviation detection is to find out the abnormal situation of data. Deviation includes
many potential sports training indicators, such as anomalous instances in the classifica-
tion, deviations in results from predictions, and changes in magnitude. The basic
method of deviation detection is to find the difference between the result and the refer-
ence, which can be expressed by Eq. 13.

j 2
S- Pi(m)e+A

i=1

c (13)

 

 

In which the Pi(w) represents the difference between the observations and the refer-
ence, and the Pi(m) is the fuzzy mathematical method.

The forecast is to use historical data to find the law of change, establish a model, and
use this model to predict the types and characteristics of the data. Regression analysis
is a typical prediction method, which establishes a regression equation with time as a
variable. In the prediction process, entering any time value can get the status at this
time. The neural network method realizes the learning of nonlinear samples, which can
discriminate nonlinear functions. Classification can also be used for prediction, but
classification is generally used for discrete values; regression prediction is used for con-
tinuous values; neural network method prediction can be used for continuous values as
well as discrete values [20, 21].

The expression and interpretation of results are based on the user’s purpose of ana-
lyzing the information and distinguishing the most valuable information.

The data type

 

Fig. 6 The model of the data mining process J]

The patterns found in the early stages are evaluated by the user, and the useless pat-
terns are deleted. If the user’s requirements cannot be met, the pattern is returned to
the previous stage. In addition, the end users faced by data mining are people. There-
fore, the discovered patterns must be visualized. For example, the decision tree is trans-
formed into an “if...then...” rule whose process model is shown in Fig. 6.

3.2 Effective data analysis
If the sample belongs to the same class, this node is a leaf node and is marked with this
class. Otherwise, the measure of information gain is used as heuristic information to se-
lect the attribute of the sample classification, which is the “test” or “decision” attribute
of the node. Assumed that all attributes are classified, that is, take discrete values. The
branch is created for each known value of the test attribute, and the sample is divided.
The algorithm uses a similar approach, recursively forming the sample decision tree
on each partition. Once the attribute appears on a node, it is not necessary to consider
this attribute on the descendants of the node. The entire recursion process stops when
one of the following conditions is true:

(1) All samples for the given node belong to the same class.

(2) There are no remaining attributes that can be used to further divide.

(3) There is no sample in the branch. In this case, the leaf is created with the majority of
the training sample set. When the decision tree is created, many branches reflect
abnormalities in training. The pruning method uses statistical metrics to clip the least
reliable branches to improve the ability of the decision tree to correctly classify.

The pre-pruning method prunes by stopping the construction of the tree in advance.
Once stopped, the node becomes the leaf. This leaf has the most frequent classes in the
subset sample. When constructing a tree, if the information gain is the equal measure,
it can be used to assess the superiority of the split. If the partitioning of the sample re-
sults in a split below a predefined threshold, the partitioning stops. However, choosing
a proper threshold is difficult, higher may result in an oversimplified tree, and lower
will make the simplification too little. The method expression can be written as follows:
Qian and Liu EURASI/P Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:121 Page 12 of 17

5= ty (Pi(m)-t)? (14)
ble

In which 6 means the pre-pruning method, y represents containing the sample of
subsets, Pi(m) represents the fuzzy mathematics method, and ¢ represents the fancier of
decision tree.

Post-pruning is the cutting of fully grown branches. By deleting the node’s branches,
the nodes are cut off. In the pruning algorithm of the cost complexity, the untrimmed
nodes become leaves.

The expected error rate of pruned subtrees on non-leaf nodes is calculated. Then,
combing the weighting of the branches, the error rate of each branch is used to calcu-
late the expected error rate of no pruning. If the pruning results in a high error rate,
the subtree is preserved. Using test sets to evaluate the accuracy of each tree, the deci-
sion tree with the lowest expected error rate is obtained. Post-pruning requires more
calculations than pruning, but the resulting tree is more reliable, and its formula can be
written as Eq. 15.

2
As = oe a) +g) Fo/H (15)

In which As represents the marker expression, A, represents the error rate of each
branch, A» is the weight assessment of the branches, V means the range of element re-
cords, go represents the index of the index, Fy represents the index range, and H is the
concept tree method.

When extracting classification rules from the decision tree, the rules are expressed in
the form of “if-then.” The rule is created for each path from the root to the leaves to form
the conjunct of the predecessor. Leaf nodes contain class predictions that form the rule
post. Based on the analysis of the three processes of data preparation, data mining, and re-
sult interpretation, the model based on the analysis of sports training index obtains the
data mining results of the index and realizes the analysis of the index. The application of
data mining technology in the analysis of sports training index was completed.

4 Experiment

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the technology proposed in this paper, a simula-
tion test analysis is performed. The test uses different types of sports training index as
objects for the analysis. In order to ensure the validity of the test, the conventional
index analysis method is used as a comparison object. The test data is presented in the
same chart, and conclusions are reached through the calculation of comprehensive ana-
lysis capabilities.

4.1 Data preparation

The test parameters are set to ensure the accuracy of the test. In this paper, differ-
ent types of index are used as test objects. Two kinds of analysis methods are used
to conduct simulation tests and analyze the results. Because the results obtained by
different methods and the analysis methods are different, it is necessary to ensure
the consistency of the environment. The data set results in this paper are shown
in Table 1.

The two analysis methods are put in this environment, and the simulation data is
loaded. The simulation parameters are shown in Table 2.

4.2 Test design

In order to verify the comprehensive analysis capabilities of the two methods, the ex-
periments of coverage simulation, accuracy simulation, and immunity simulation were
carried out in this paper. The results are recorded, and the comprehensive ability of the
index analysis is calculated according to the formula.

First, the data is input into the simulation system set in accordance with the require-
ments of Table 1, and the correlation operation is performed. Then, under the same
conditions, three experiments were conducted separately.

Finally, the third-party software of analysis and recording is used to analyze the data
generated, while eliminating the uncertainty caused by various factors. For different
types of indicators and analysis methods, simulation tests were performed and the re-
sults were shown in the test comparison curves. The conclusion is drawn by the for-

mula for calculating the comprehensive analysis ability.

4.3 The test of coverage simulation

The comparison curve of the results of the coverage simulation test is shown in Fig. 7.

From the comparison curve, it can be seen that the overall results of the method de-
signed in this paper is 87.41%, while the coverage of the traditional method is only
79.42%.

4.4 The test of the accuracy simulation
The comparison curve of the test results is shown in Fig. 8.

By comparison, the error rate of the method designed in this paper is 89.92%, while
that of the traditional analysis method is 74.12%.

4.5 The test of the noise immunity simulation
The comparison curve of the noise immunity simulation test results is shown in Fig. 9.

As can be seen in Fig. 9, the anti-interference ability of the design method is 98.41%,
while the anti-jamming capability of the traditional analysis method is 69.53%.

4.6 The calculation of comprehensive analysis ability
Substitute the test results of coverage and accuracy into the following formula:

xaakD (°), (16)
Qian and Liu EURASI/P Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:121 Page 16 of 17

In which D represents the coverage test results, g means the results of the accuracy
test, y represents the results of the noise immunity test, and k represents the simulation
coefficient. This paper takes 0.98.

The proposed method is denoted as x;, the conventional method is denoted asy2,
Ay =X1-—X2 is the positive number indicates that the comprehensive analysis ability is
improved, and the negative number Ay = x; — x2 represents the decrease in the compre-
hensive analysis ability. Then, the Ay = y; — Xo is written as follows:

AY = X1-X2

“He C8) BEC)

= 0.371409

Compared with the conventional method, the comprehensive ability of the data min-
ing application is increased by 37.14%, which can be applied to the analysis of sports
training index of different data types.

5 Results and discussion

This paper puts forward the application of data mining technology in the analysis of
sports training indicators. It relies on the construction of the index analysis model;
through the analysis of mining process and data, the analysis of sports training index is
completed. The experimental data shows that the method designed in this paper has
extremely high effectiveness. It is hoped that the research in this paper can provide a
theoretical basis for the analysis methods of sports training indicators.
