Abstract

One of the basic approaches in science views behavioral products as a process within a
dynamic system. The mechanism might be seen as a representation of many instances
of centralized control in real time. Many real systems, however, exhibit autonomy by
denying statically treated mechanisms. This study addresses the issues related to the
identification of dynamic systems and suggests how determining the basic princi-

ples of a collective structure may be the key to understanding complex behavioral
processes. A fundamental model is derived to assess the advantages of this perspec-
tive using a basic methodology. The connection between perspective and technique
demonstrates certain aspects within their actual context while also clearly including
the framework of actual dynamic system identification.

Introduction

System dynamics can be used as a tool to address many applications in a very broad sense.
It applies to systems in many different disciplines, such as control, communication, trop-
isms, and even systems of systems (Mandl 2019). Given the very widespread use of the
term “system, the important questions are as follows: What does the term “system” actu-
ally mean? What makes a system “dynamic”? These terms cannot be defined through strict
codification because a system is an abstract or vague entity (Rosen 1985). A well-formu-
lated notion of a system could, however, be developed using a nonsystem definition. A
nonsystem can be represented by a set of isolated entities that do not interact with each
other or a collection of entities whose relationships have no implications for the properties
or behaviors of the entities (Pattee 1973). Given how vague word definitions can be, the
notions that we use describe a wide variety of things (Marchal 1975). Let us thus specify
how these notions may be understood in the light of an account of a dynamic system.

First, a system is a collection of individual elements: it is not usual to talk about a sys-
tem having only one component (Chen and Billings 1992). It is then likely that the ele-
ments comprising the system exhibit nontrivial interactions, for instance, coherence
in terms of moving or working together [x > f — f(x;)]. Here, x denotes an element
composed of many individuals; f is a function toward a certain direction (—), such as
a goal, and f(x;) denotes coherence, which involves certain individuals (x,), but not all
individuals, underlying a very well-defined goal boundary (f/f). The second important—
indeed, key—assumption for a system is that the well-defined individuals must interact
not just with one another but also with everything outside the system (Sch6ner 2002),
which is called the environment [x; — f(x;) — y;]. In this equation, there are two kinds
of interactions that x; can have with the outside environment. The outside exerts some
impact (x) on them and is influenced (y) by them at a certain time (¢). Thus, intuitively, a
system can be defined as many interactive individual and embedded elements exhibiting
a certain coherent behavior (Barabasi 2005).

Likewise, if we think about the system at any given time as defined as a set of num-
bers that are the values (x;) of variables, the collection of a system will be defined as
identical to, and specified by, the functional forms /f; over time (t) from time=0
[a = fi(x1, x2,..., X,), (i=1, 2,..., m)]. However, no behavior of the system can
correspond to this logic, as no other systems’ behaviors are constant in time. In other
words, systems are such that behaviors occur over different timescales, in the same
way that the behaviors of a group of people while ice skating occur over different time-
scales (Borgonovi et al. 2019): every event should be the initial condition for the next
slice of time, and every division should set the stage for the next. The coherence of per-
formance of the people (on the ice) must be nested dynamically within a continuous
time interval (Chen and Billings 1992). Thus, if we consider that there are certain con-
tinuous approximations using finite intervals of time between changes of state within
an interval, the system can be absorbed into a new functional type of organization
[Si = gi(x1, ¥2,..., % —1), (G=1, 2,..., 1-1).

In this logic, the system contains two variables, each of which is absolute but each of
which changes suddenly to the other in the field (Schoner 2002). This may be a product of
multiple causes by which any individual changes its behavior dynamically (Ashby 1947).
At this point, the questions of “What is a system?” and “What makes a system dynamic?”

seem to be recognized with regard to the picture, and the situation seems far less static.

Part 1: Nonrepresentational perspectives of phenomena (theoretical basis)

There is a well-defined assumption called the problem of impoverished entailment
(Shaw 2001), which is the minimal starting point for understanding any system of inter-
est at any level of interest. “X is about Y” is true only if “X entails Y” and “Y entails X”
are true. This is a loop of entailment; the specificity of X to its source of Y means that
X entails the source by which X is entailed. Diagrammatically, an entailment can be
expressed as X—>Y. The primary property of an entailment is that it propagates “truth”
hereditarily—Y inherits the truth of X (Rosen 1991). Thus, the loop of entailment can
be shown diagrammatically as X—> Y— X, and the diagram can be read as meaning that
truth propagates hereditarily in both directions. Such an explanation focuses on assem-
bling all parts of elements [C(s)] along with the other “things” that can influence them
Park Complex Adapt Syst Model (2020) 8:2 Page 3 of 25

or be influenced by them [E(s)], even the internal structure of the system [S(s)] (Mahner
and Bunge 1997).

m(s) = (C(s), E(s), S(s)). (1)

In this framework, when m is predicated as a mass of a particular object, it identi-
fies a substantial property intrinsic to the object that is identical whenever and wherever
the object is observed. However, m has other relational properties that engage actual
things. For example, when the object is grasped and brought down hard and repetitively
on another object, then m can be a “hammer” with respect to the object. Conceivably,
there are many relational properties that the object may have by virtue of its relation-
ship either with other objects or with perceivers-actors, but these are, at best, indefinite
properties until a particular spatiotemporal relationship is effected (Gibson 1979). When
this occurs, one of the many potential relational properties of the object is actualized.

However, investigating the dynamics in these cases typically requires a significant
number of elements and obviously includes multiple components that must be man-
aged. According to researchers (Bernstein 1966), organisms have too many degrees of
freedom. Moreover, if the parts are considered to be very strongly defined by their con-
nections and to function within the context, great complexity can be observed (Rosen
1987). When even a single cell’s behavior is being considered, its tendencies do not allow
certain prediction of all of these dynamics (Ford 2008; Strong and Ray 1975), and this
prompts deep concerns over how to treat the cell relevantly as well as raising questions
about how these behaviors form from numerous factors.

Instead of positively interpreting the system’s dynamics in terms of every encoded
equation, the key idea is to describe why numerous modes of emergent phenom-
ena underlying local-level interaction have to be governed by simple rules (Iberall and
Soodak 1987). Where elements are given a simple set of rules that govern their behavior
and allow them to interact to determine what patterns emerge over time, it has been
shown that an agent’s behavior with respect to unpredictable phenomena can arise even
with elementary governing rules (Roundy et al. 2018). This fresh perspective on refocus-
ing a system’s dynamics is helping to bridge traditional biases and has been stimulating
scientists to distil out simple principles, such that a better understanding of a dynamic

system (which is not always very complicated) may be gained.

Part 2: Individual behavior in social dynamics (model-based)

To explore the rule of thumb from a broader perspective, computer simulation has been
performed first on the basics of a spatially explicit model of mobile agents in continuous
space (Rangel et al. 2018) to determine the basic regulatory principles involved in the
way they conceptualize their environment (Bonabeau 2002). In other words, the imple-
mented model shows the potential to infer how simple individual rules can lead to con-
sistent group behavior and how slight changes in those mechanisms can have a dramatic
impact on an individual’s behavioral patterns (Reynolds 1987). Although an analysis of
simple implication is an apparent first step in providing proof of concept, this individ-
ual-based simulation has become significant enough to be tested in a broader range of
applications for evolutionary dynamics for the following reasons. First, as the agents
Park Complex Adapt Syst Model (2020) 8:2 Page 4 of 25

represent individuals who have participated from the bottom up, the actual state of their
behavior tends to be more informative (agent-based modeling) than in other cases. Next,
as the main point of this implementation is a description that deals with the state per
time as the critical factor in its allocation of neighbors, the number of neighbors placed
on the position is based on the moves scheduled for a given moment (context-varying
cultural evolution) (Oliva 2016) [see “Methods I (agent-based model)” for more detail].

Result

The model provides a natural description of a pattern of behavior and allows us to under-
stand a realistic adaptation incorporating behavioral algorithms with social dynamics.
The mechanisms characterized in the agenda show that the model has the capacity to
produce three types of factors. First, the behavioral pattern is the result of the applied
individual components; this comes not only from the initial conditions of the autono-
mous agents but also from the fact that they are interconnected. Second, the range of

vertical axis =/j). Following the simulation, the left plot shows a displacement that separates individuals

with a relative position structure controlled by the initial setting. This implies that although the pattern

of individual behavior depends on a localized view of the initial conditions, a slight change in individual
characteristics [individual's upward velocity (v;) resulting in a loss of group heading (Vayg)] underlying its
social influence [calculated from the social ties (k = St) multiplied by the mutation rate (u)] has a remarkably
diverging (a) or converging (b) effect on its displacement. The blue dots represent their position in an

x, y coordinate plane, and the red lines denote links (see Additional file 1: Figure S5 for more detail). 2
Approximation of the evolution underlying interconnected interactions (coordinate system: horizontal

axis = 7 and vertical axis =/j).The plots indicate that the patterns that occur correspond to the relative value.
With certain defaults of their relativity, a slight change in the scalar value (social ties = St) produces a dramatic
impact at a certain point [a=St(0.55), b = St(0.56), c= St(0.57)]: blue dots = individuals, red lines = links,
background = density with symmetrical characteristics between the individual and group headings. Notice
that as the social ties increases a—c, symmetrical characteristics are biased to one side ¢ (see Additional file 1:

different combinations of the internal and the external states plays a part in the rapid
propagation in the system (see Fig. 1-1). Third, however, when the interconnected rela-
tion between the internal trait underlying its external trait is applied, the widespread
heterogeneity of the mechanisms can abstract the repertoire of displayed behaviors (see
Fig. 1-2) (see Additional file 1: 1.4 for more detail).

The primary feature of the agents’ interactions is heterogeneous in this abstract set-
ting. As the topology of the interaction traits can lead to significant deviations from the
predicted pattern of behavior, it may generate various effects that mimic the behavior of
real individuals in social dynamics. At the points where these individuals interact, sensi-
ble decisions occur, in line with an empirical study showing that individuals learn how to

keep relative velocity as a key factor for homogeneity (McLeod and Dienes 1996).

Discussion

The simulations show that different interconnection structures have an effect on which
strategies perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. The results
may suggest that the relative velocity can be the pure candidate and works effectively.
According to researchers (McLeod and Dienes 1996), if an object (i.e., a ball) is already
high in the air and travelling directly in line with the individual (i.e., the player), the indi-
vidual might utilize some simple heuristics. Namely, the individual fixes his gaze on the
object, starts running, and adjusts his velocity to ensure that the angle of the ball above
the horizon appears constant (Gigerenzer 2004). The prediction is not that the individ-
ual runs to a precomputed landing spot and waits for the object but that he modifies his
actions to keep the image of the object moving at a constant velocity. It is also possible
that individuals do not compute (Vv) at all in this model but would reduce a maintained
value of d?(v)/dt? in a systematic way. As V increased, they would keep d?(v) /dt* at
zero [d? (v) /dt”=constant] (Reed et al. 2010). This is related to what information can
be derived as a strategy in the system and how that information can be best obtained
through the dynamics.

This result also holds for a step progression toward such a relationship,
as explicitly shown by the dramatic change in regard to the point where
[d? (v) /dt” = constant] reaches [d?” (v) /dt? éconstant]. Let us suggest that actual-
ized observation of the pattern corresponds not simply to the object’s velocity
but, instead, to changes in the velocity between individuals at a certain point. In
other words, the actual displacement (S) estimated is given by (Sp = S; + ad’).
Here, the observed new displacement (Sp) is equal to the displacement across the
individuals (/') plus its relative velocity (w) multiplied by the distance squared (d”)
from the neighbor. This indicates that the farther an individual is from the neigh-
bor (role model or group heading), when measured at a certain point, the more
difficult it is for the individual to follow the neighbor because of the greater accel-
eration involved. On this assumption, the results might suggest a strategy such
as evolvable traits or payoff functions to guide the evolution of these heuristics

through social learning (see Fig. 2).

interconnected condition, the system becomes highly sensitive to small changes in the scalar values (i.e.,
social ties) of individuals at a certain point. The horizontal axis of the normal distribution denotes a scalar [(x
) =social ties in this simulation) from 0 to 1, and the vertical axis represents the probability density at the
scalar value (x). This suggests that if the individual fails to keep the trait (blue area= range from St 0.55—)

Part 3: Elementary coordination in circadian rhythm (experimental-based)

One useful strategy of obtaining simplicity through system dynamic looks for cycles
at all time scales (McGhee and Jain 1972) and aims to show how interacting cyclic
processes (Collins and Stewart 1993) account for the emergence of new entities (Shaw
and Kinsella-Shaw 1988; Turvey and Carello 2012), many of which are similarly cyclic
(Yadlapalli et al. 2018). The central idea is that Earth’s cycles—geophysical, hydro-
logical, meteorological, geochemical, and biochemical—have interacted to create
self-replicating living systems that conform to specific cyclicities (Maury et al. 2010).
This assumption has led us to enquire whether something akin to attunement to the
environmental 24-h day/night cycles (Maury et al. 2010) may be apparent in an exper-
imental setting of bimanual coordination, a context that has been used to examine
self-organization in biological systems (Kugler and Turvey 2015).

The present study used two main ways of determining these characteristics and dis-
covering if approximations under certain conditions serve these self-potentials (see
Additional file 1: 2.1 for more detail). The first involves an increase in the capabil-
ity to self-generate forces along the lines of the roles of the fundamental dimensions
of environments (temperature embedding in light-dark cycles). To achieve this, the
experimental setting asks, “Is our system influenced by an ecological feature?” by
embedding a bimanual coordination task in an ordinary 24-h day-night cycle (5:00,
12:00, 17:00, and 24:00). The second is tied to observing the availability of an inter-
nally based source (coordination) or sources of force (stability and entropy) within
dynamical boundaries in systematic ways. The setting asks, “How does our system
adapt to regular or irregular thermal structures?” by embedding the comparison
of normal and abnormal day-night circadian temperature effects at dawn (5 a.m.,
approximately when the core temperature reaches its minimum) and dusk (5 p.m.,

approximately when the core temperature reaches its maximum) (Aschoff 1983) (see
“Methods II (experimental-based model)” for more detail).

Result
A variety of measures (e.g., phase shift, variability, entropy) were examined for evidence
of entrainment or any influence of the embedding rhythm on stability or attractor loca-
tion (only entropy production was suggested for the main results; see Additional file 1:
2.3 for the entropy calculation). With respect to experiment 1, the behavioral perfor-
mance (entropy) shows a maximum at 5:00 but has a more clearly defined minimum at
approximately 17:00 in the day—night cycle, while the core body temperature rhythm
shows a minimum at 5:00 but has a maximum at approximately 17:00 (see Fig. 3-1).
Regarding experiments 2 and 3, the entropy was affected by the temporal locus during
the circadian cycle, as well as by the introduction of a heated vest (Experiment 2) and
an ice vest (Experiment 3); the effects of the thermal manipulation were not identical

(see Additional file 1: 2.1.4 for the temperature measure). Even if the same external
temperature perturbations were given, the influence of the vest was negatively exagger-
ated (increasing entropy) at dawn but positively exaggerated (decreasing entropy) in the
evening (see Additional file 1: 2.2 for more detail).

The estimated dynamics from the relative phase between two limbs, oscillatory coor-
dination, was affected by the temporal locus during the circadian cycle (see Fig. 3-2). The
results at this biological scale correspond to a theoretical study that has shown that the
rate of entropy production is changed when a new energy source is accessed via a non-
equilibrium phase transition process (Frank 2011).

Discussion

The organism may convert its own internal energy so efficiently that it is able to produce
anything physically possible (England 2013). These results from Experiments 1, 2, and 3
reflect that accessing a new energy source differs as a function of the circadian cycle and
that access can be manipulated by a temporary thermal manipulation. Given the very
widespread use of these features, what types of essential properties are involved in the
extended emergent elementary dynamics between oscillators? According to researchers
(Pikovsky et al. 2003), the basic element of the coordination (6) is equal to o (x7!~® = 6),
and such an equation resembles the log base x of, which is equal to 6; — 69. Then, with
respect to the experimental results, the essential foundation of the symmetry dynamics
between oscillators (), the preferred elementary frequency of the individual segment of
x to the other relative phase from the intended phase, is nearly equal to the slightly asym-
metric potential («®-° = Aw). Thus, if this logic simply keeps going and the outcome
is observed in terms of the approximate relative stability of this coordination dynamic,
this logic will have “x to the variation of the relative phase (id) is equal to 6; — 62 = o
multiplied by Aw” That is identical to [x = b- (Aw), and this dynamic potential will
finally be dependent on | Aw (rad * x"), rad = radian. Pervasive interconnectedness—
everything is connected with another thing or other things—suggests that behavior is
adapted to perceiving both the nested environmental properties and one’s own nested
behaviors—a union that organizes actions on surrounding circumstances (Reed 1996).
The observation of the direct and robust relationship between biological aspects (body
temperature and motor synchrony) and an environmental process (circadian temperature

cycle) may echo the adaptation of our system to the environment (Iberall 1977).

Part 4: Approximated common property of the behavioral patterns

Under these observations, a system may be found to exhibit a variety of hitherto unob-
served dynamical behaviors, including cultural evolutionary characteristics and the
coexistence of multiple search strategies (Arena et al. 2018). This study proposes that
the features investigated are a particularly appropriate assumption in terms of obtaining
simplicity from complexity.

system according to the circadian temperature cycle. The red line and shade (distribution) denote the
observed abnormal states in the perturbed circadian temperature conditions. The dots surrounded by yellow
colors (Response) denote plausible evidence for the association of this property. The crucial variable, which
can intuitively be set in both dynamics, can simply be considered as the rate of change between the objects
arranged according to a high-sensitivity rule. The results above describe a complex behavior with a divided
phase (Aw) space in which areas of stability are surrounded by confusion. This implies that although their
initial states are almost identical (in a comparison of the middle left area of the plot), the response becomes
remarkably different with iteration of n times

 

 

 

 

and obtains (s(%)), and then the model inputs that into the (™m) and finally takes m(s(x)).
Going back to the insight by researchers (Mahner and Bunge 1997; Turvey 2018), related
to the minimal starting point for understanding any system as a function of interest at
any level of interest (see Eq. 1), (s), this includes the collection of all parts of elements
[C(s)] and comprises all other things influencing them [E(s)], even the internal struc-
ture of the system [S(s)]. Thus, we input (x) as arranged as (x) so that it somehow pro-
vides us with intuition about a system’s fundamental properties (s). This property and
the inputs into function (m) help us get to the point of understanding any system based
on the system of interest at any level of interest.

As we take this composite function, it models a system that starts with individual seg-
ments (x) as the input, and it shows the minimal starting point of the system (s) that will
be dependent on the relative individual distance. Thus, how should a system that can be
identified or predicted (1) be related to how it depends on the individual segments in
a given context? (Melchers and Beck 2018). The fundamental properties demonstrated
may be able to create a useful system dynamics reference so that this functional pattern
can be applied to various phenomena (see Fig. 4).

Oddly enough, those curiosities might be able to have the same general answer: crea-
tion of sophisticated functions from simple elements. There is possible evidence for the
association of this property when we compute an approximation of its sensitivity to ini-

tial conditions; staying close can show the possible entity as a function of the system's

NC

the object’s crucial variable (r’) that causes the different value in both dynamics to be
considered simply (/ y) arranged in certain rules (i.e., exponential). This function
reflects that the sort of highly sensitive components was associated with a rate of change,
which increased or decreased at a certain point (Rosenstein et al. 1993) by measuring
the contraction (stable system) or expansion (chaotic system) near the orbit of distance
[d(xo, xo + €)] during the next iteration of distance [d (f (x0), f (*o + €))] (see Fig. 4 dots
surrounded by yellow colors [Response]). That is, the simple rules in regard to what the
dynamics provide as the primary characteristics that show the simple function can serve
as the basic principle to use when investigating various patterns (Mead 2017).

Conclusion
One type of logic has focused on the orderly systems underlying the perfect relation-
ships of one point to another (Gaskell and Laughlin 2017). That is to say, there is a direct
connection owing to the effect that arises directly from a cause. It follows that if we
know the present state of the system, the system can fully determine its past and future
state. Although this approach has proven to be a very good means of approximation for
describing reality in various fields, the real world in which we actually live is not always
covered by these principles (Lear 2012). Most of one’s experience might not be due to
this type of direct relationship. An important concept for the system, i.e., iterating a sim-
ple function, even generates the irregular geometric patterns we see in nature from such
a structure (Rian and Asayama 2016). This indicates that there can be an output greater
than the sum of the constituting parts due to synergetic relations or less than the sum of
its individual components due to the relationships with interference (Haken 2012).
Regarding this assumption behind the simulations which estimated the possible prin-
ciples of affirmative evolutionary capabilities of a system (Edelman 2016), this study
addresses the issues related to the identification of dynamic systems and suggests how
determining the basic principles of a collective structure may be key to understanding
complex behavioral processes. Distinct approaches (theoretical, modelling, and experi-
mental) were used in an effort to understand how to recognize the basic feature through
the dynamics of the system. The condition leading to the behavioral property under
these different perspectives suggests that it is not reliant on an individual lodged in the
corner of the system. Rather, if the fundamental condition is in place, the dynamics of
the system falls into the same rules (Iberall and Soodak 1987) that are estimating the
pattern (Rosen 1985). Our validation still needs to be polished against what happens in
various fields and then further extending the model, but in general, the approaches and
mechanisms achieved here could be useful for researchers and those who need to under-
stand dynamics in phenomena itself.

Methods | (agent-based model)
The model first considers the agents try to move toward somewhere while steering with
other individuals in the group. Thus, each has its position, velocity, and exploration,

which are initialized to values randomized within specified continuous space. However,
Park Complex Adapt Syst Model (2020) 8:2 Page 11 of 25

at the same time, their pattern of behavior depends not only on the autonomous individ-
uals’ initial state but also on its external states. In other words, to control which agents
interact, when they interact, and how they interact, the mechanism holds internal traits
as a tradeoff (between the individual velocity and group velocity) and external traits as
a network characteristic (social ties multiplied by a mutation rate). The rules and pro-
cesses in the artificially modeled structure describe an individual’s homogeneous drives,
and the mechanism behind this process is based on the social learning in which success-
ful strategies are propagated through imitation (see Additional file 1: 1.3 for the model
variables).

Operating principle

The agents are physically related to each other on some spatial representation allowing
them to move anywhere in the space. The set of n-tuples of a real number, denoted by
IR”, is called n-spaces [x = (%1,%2,...,X,) € R”]. A particular n-tuples in R” is a point
which called the coordinates, components, or elements of x. This is one of the stand-
ard ways in which the agents can continue to move in the space. The agents then move
within the boundaries of the plane steering toward somewhere.

u = dave + bi, dave = | Zave || *k dave: bj = | di *k di (3)

where the a is the group’s heading and b is each agent’s (i) coherence toward the center
of the group. The order (iz) is symmetric because all the agents are identical; thus indi-
viduals are naturally heading together in a certain direction, while at the same time
maintaining a certain distance from each other as their inherited survival strategies (Jad-
babaie et al. 2003).

The model, then, includes another operation with respect to the individual’s current
movement (v) written simply by (® = “+ v). That new quantity of @ is the sum of z + ¥,
where the vectors stay away from the origin. The way we define this is that each vector
represents a certain movement; a step with a certain distance and direction in space. If
we take a step along the first vector of the #, and then a step in the direction and distance
described by the second vector of the v, the overall effect is just the same as if we had
moved along the sum of those two vectors to begin with (see Fig. 5).

The first quantity here (green line) has the coordinate (“4 = t. and the second

quantity (blue line) has the coordinate (v = 2p. When we take the sum of the two

quantities, we can see a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second quantity:
move 4 to the right and 1 up, then move 1 to the right again and 2 up. To rearrange these
steps, first move 4+ 1 to the right, then move 1+ 2 up; the new quantity (black line) has
coordinates 4+ 1 and 1+2 from the origin. Exhibited in this list-of-numbers conception

where the function assumes that the attribute of the component is conditional upon the

the other length (||Vavg \). This trait is implemented according to quantity as follows:

where the 7; is the individual's velocity represented by the length of the individual’s mag-
nitude (||v;||) with the direction of individual (d;). The Vave is their average velocity which
includes the entire population of N individuals’ navigation. The result of the v; and the
Vavg produces a new quantity Vj,ew written simply as (V > Vinew = Vi + Vavg). Going back

to the conditional (IF) assumption with this individual quantity, if the object (Vv) faces the

 

 

parameters (%) with the states of their quantities ((|v;|| and | Vavg ), the condition set pro-

duces an opposite direction (+) depending on its norm as follows:

tion = 180° counterclockwise), something that takes in inputs and spits out an output for

each one;

Imagine that every possible input vector multiplied by the matrix moves over to its

S

corresponding output vector multiplied by the matrix (or inverse) without becoming
curved and that the origin must remain fixed in place; what the coordinates are is deter-
mined by where each basis vector lands (see Fig. 6).

This refers to the fact that the model’s basic pattern of group behavior depends on the
value of v with a localized view of the initial conditions of the randomly initialized point;
increasing the individual’s quantity v underlying the group’s initial condition “ causes
their portrait to diverge (dotted blue line) or converge (dotted red line). Such a funda-
mental operation allows us to reach every possible point (not as an arrow but actually as
a single point) in the plane, considering every possible linear combination that we can
obtain from the two dimensional quantities.

Based on these functions, the element v then contains a more detailed algorithm of
how the individual’s new position was implemented in which a subset holds that (i) the
zero vector belongs to v, and (ii) vectors and any multiplication of scalars is also in v.

Such a mechanism is dependent on quantity as follows.

Movement characteristics (internal source)

First of all, the new position dynamic is augmented by the designated trade-off value
(Woodworth 1899) of the individual velocity-group heading [IGT: individual’s velocity up
(vj) resulted in a loss of group heading (Vgyg)] as follows;

Finew = (1—[[kl) #96 [kl] Vang K€ [0,1 (8)

where v; is the velocity of each individual, Vz)g is the average velocity about group head-
ing, and the value of k is a scalar that controls their trade-off. For example, the product
of a y; by a scalar k is a vector | |v with magnitude || times the magnitude of ||v;|| and
with direction di, the same as or opposite to that of v;,, according to whether k is positive
or negative [if k = 0 (null vector) I|k |v has zero magnitude and no specific direction].
This means that every new position vector will be a combination multiplied by the scalar

are from the multiplied scalar (||k ; k|| € [0,1]). This gives us a global view so that we

can conceptualize the list of quantities in a visual way and thereby simplify and clarify

basic operational patterns.

Network characteristics (external source)

The model then includes another characteristic for dealing with more or less distinct
patterns of behavior. In social practice, just as individuals are more likely to change their
decisions depending on the influences surrounding them (Demsar and Bajec 2013), so

the individual’s new quantity (Vv) holds its network characteristics as given;
Viiinew = ((1 — IK ||) Vj + || ** Vave ) + Vs, Vs = |lvs|| * ds (10)

where ¥, is a vector with a length v, and direction d, as a function of the network density (ND).
The network density arises from its social ties (Santos et al. 2006) based on the nodes and cal-
culated by its actual connection (AC) with the potential connection (PC) of the network.

lvs||] = ND=AC/PC, AC=(2*t)/N, PC=N(N —1)/2 (11)

where the network density (||vs||) describes the potential connections in a network that
are actual connections (AC /PC). The potential connection (PC = N(N — 1)/2) is a con-
nection that could potentially exist between two individual regardless of whether or not
it actually does (see Additional file 1: 1.1 for more detail). These small linear contribu-
tions to their dynamics, and this structural instability can be interpreted as the network
characteristics being influenced by the exploration rate (k’= scalar), which corresponds

to a mutation term in genetics given as:

Viiiinew = ((1 — |||) * Vj + «| ** Vavg ) + Vss5 Vss = |IVss ll * dss

new position vector considers its network density as another quantity [(c3 = ||’ DE For

x2 1 x2 c31 x22

xp b2*c3= x41, #21 *C3 = x22 (14)

In the presence of the network density, the system settles down into a state with a
more pronounced increasing (or decreasing) mutation rate in every update step, and it

yields (see Fig. 8):

interdependency between the two traits

With these implementations, instead of the widespread extension underlying the com-
bination, the model proposes to adopt an existing possible interconnected relationship
between the network and its movement characteristics. Let us think about simple inter-
dependency between the two components (trade-off between individual velocity and
group heading as an internal, network density multiplied by mutation as an external).
If the individual’s tendency is very remote from the group’s purpose, its mutation in the
system will not propagate to the individuals, or vice versa. For this application, the new
position mechanism assumes that the social network characteristics (||Vs5 || = scalar) are a
denominator applied by the index of difficulty (id = scalar) as a numerator.

the trade-off (k) between two objects about v; and Vgyg] divided by the width of the object

0.8); on the other hand, when | is 0.4, the 2D becomes small (i.e., 0.2)]. This leads to a
simple interpretation linking the vector as follows;

x1 C4X] X111 > v1 >

and, the mechanisms yields (see Fig. 9):

Notice that the combination of these arrows refers to this model’s fundamental feature.
The characteristics of every rule and process that are applied (or will be applied) in this
model must be within this functional dynamic. This provides an excellent way of conceptu-
alizing many lists of individuals in a visual way, which can clarify patterns in mechanisms.
It also shows a global view of what certain operations do to describe how an individual is
being manipulated in space using numbers that can be run through a computation.

The model now considers an adoption probability which is given by an estimate of Vinew
by the individuals. Indeed, as each individual may not know the exact value of the trait that
has adopted the other’s Viney, this model yields that they can estimate the value at every
schedule of each generation via the comparison given.

(velocity) of the focal individual, 2, is a payoff of the role individual, e denotes the expo-
nential, and w is the intensity of the selection (w<1=weak selection, w — oo=strong
selection). The focal individual imitates the strategy of the nearby role individual, com-
paring its new position vector (large Am =velocity difference large, small Az =velocity
difference small), and then the focal individual chooses to imitate the strategy of the role

individual (see Additional file 1: 1.2 for different implementation cases for the z).

Methods II (experimental-based model)

The present model used two main ways of determining these characteristics and discover-
ing whether approximations under certain conditions serve these self-potentials. The first
involves an increase in the capability to self-generate forces along the lines of the roles of the
fundamental dimensions of environments (temperature embedding in light-dark cycles). To
achieve this, the experimental setting asks, “Is our system influenced by an ecological fea-
ture?” by embedding a bimanual coordination task in an ordinary 24-h day-night cycle (5:00,
12:00, 17:00, and 24:00). The second is tied to observing the availability of an internally based
source (coordination) or sources of force (stability and entropy) within dynamical bounda-
ries in systematic ways. The setting asks, “How does our system adapt to regular or irregu-
lar thermal structures?” by embedding the comparison of normal and abnormal day-night
circadian temperature effects at dawn (5 a.m., approximately when the core temperature
reaches its minimum) and dusk (5 p.m., approximately when the core temperature reaches
its maximum) (Aschoff 1983) (see Additional file 1: 2.1 for more detail).

Circadian rhythm of temperature (external source)

The core cycles of a biological system are influenced by temperature, with 24-h light—
dark oscillation (called circadian rhythm), as well as by biochemical, physiological, or
behavioral processes that persist under constant conditions with a period length of ~ 24
(Soodak and Iberall 1978). Presumably, due to inputs to the thermoregulatory centers
from the body core (Refinetti and Menaker 1992), the circadian rhythm of biology shows
a minimum at 5:00 (when core body temperature is rising most rapidly) but has a more
clearly defined maximum at about 17:00 in the daylight (when core body temperature is
falling most rapidly) cycle (Moore 1995) (see Fig. 10).

This circadian change (in core temperature) is most likely due to the rhythmic input
from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) acting upon the hypothalamic thermoregulatory
centers and altering the thresholds of cutaneous vasodilatation and sweating (Krauchi
and Wirz-Justice 1994). Specifically, melatonin appears to contribute to this change, as
its rate of secretion increase in the evening, and this increase promotes a fall in body
temperature via cutaneous vasodilatation (Cagnacci et al. 1997).

As the information is accessible, people are familiar with how such a process can
fluctuate and how it can be explained by the interaction between the internal (homeo-
static) and the external (circadian) situations (Aizawa and Cabanac 2002). There is ample
evidence of the effect of the ecological climate on various aspects of the process. Heat

exchanged with the environment by means of convection and radiation allows a gradi-
ent to be formed between the body core and temperature (Borb and Achermann 1999;
Walther et al. 2002). The rhythm in the core temperature produced by this change is
generally promoted by other rhythms, including the body clock, sleep, and physical and
mental activity, raising the possibility that the disruption of circadian rhythms can con-
tribute to complications in the human system (Maury et al. 2010). These changes in the
interior temperature in the body, as opposed to the peripheral (core temperature)—both
in animals and humans—are mainly due to circadian rhythmic changes in the rates of
ecological impacts (Edholm et al. 1973).

However, given that precise control of the internal substance (SCN) as a generator
of biological circadian rhythm is unclear, the circadian rhythm of the core body tem-
perature appears to be generated by periodic variation in heat production and heat loss
(Waterhouse et al. 2005). For instance, changes in heat loss via convection and radia-
tion are primarily caused by variations in skin blood flow, with consequent changes in
skin temperature. In particular, when the subject is performing mild activities, where a
decreased temperature is not matched by a thermal load, it has been shown to be very
effective in describing the thermal responses to activity carried out at different times of
the day (Aschoff et al. 1972).

When one considers the submaximal activity changes following a brief period, say, at
a certain temperature level (Aldemir et al. 2000), one may see initially that the response
to the same amount of moderate activity in the minimum circadian rhythm differed
from that in the maximum circadian rhythm. The mechanisms responsible for these dif-
ferent temperatures of the core and musculature during daylight cycles, as a result of
normal or non-normal ambient temperatures, will alter a range of performance factors,
including the thermoregulatory response to activity. These results fully substantiate the
predictions based on the hypothesis describing a circadian rhythm in thermoregulatory
responses and indicate that this hypothesis applies to biological adaptation regarding
certain ecological variables.

Elementary coordination (internal source)

Formation and retention refer to propriospecific information about the states of the
muscular-articular links, and the dynamical criteria of the stability pattern constrain
the patterns or characteristics. To be specific, let us consider a qualitative physical
system such as stiffness, damping, and position over time in a dynamical mass-spring

system as given.
f(t) = mx” + bx’ + kx (18)

Here, m is mass, b is friction, and k denotes the stiffness. The variable t is time, x
denotes the position, x’ is velocity, and x” represents acceleration. In physics, because
damping is produced by a process that dissipates the energy stored in the oscillations,
the interplay between input and damping approaches a stationary fixed point in the

long-time limit.

Such systems possess a static equilibrium point, which is called a point attractor
(Kugler et al. 1980) (see Fig. 11). The property of this dynamic has been applied not
only to a physical system but also to descriptions of the human neuromuscular level
(Kugler and Turvey 2015). This function involves an investigation of the intact move-
ment of a limb oscillator in terms of muscle-joint kinematic variations (kinematic
position, velocity, acceleration) over time. When we are asked to swing two limbs
comfortably, this can be characterized by the pendulum’s dimension (Kay et al. 1987),
namely, simplifying the point attractor while restricting it to certain domains of phase
space [(02—01 0), (@2—01~72)]. In this equation, with the phase difference,
02 —@1 0 denotes a condition of nearly synchronized in-phase, and 62—01xz
indicates that this in an anti-phase. The observed relative phase or phase relation (¢)
between two oscillators at @ ~0° (in-phase), or @ 180° (anti-phase) have been mod-
eled as the point attractors in our limb system, as they are purely stable patterns (Tur-
vey 1990).

In the observed relative rhythmic segments patterns, the in-phase @~0 condition
is more stable than the anti-phase @ nm condition. Inspired by a number of studies
on the 1:1 frequency locking of the left- and right-hand phase defined as 6 = (0, — Op)
—the difference between the left (L) and right (R) phase angles (@)—has led to the
identification of important invariant human system features (Kelso 1984).

V(o) = —acos($) — b cos(2) (20)

In this equation, ¢ is the phase angle of the individual oscillator. In addition, a and
b are coefficients that denote the strength of the coupling between the two oscillators.
The relevant regions of the parameter space allow the potential V(); the negative
signs in front of the coefficients simplify the equation of motion. A relative 1:1 fre-
quency-locked coordination phase [V(¢)] is determined by the differences between
the continuous phase angle [—a cos (¢) — bcos (2)] of the oscillator’s two compo-
nents: the stability of the point attractor can be varied by varying the pendulum’s
dimensions (see Fig. 12).

function close to those minima (attractors, black balls) and at local point around 90 (— 90), the state is close to

maxima (repellors, red balls). The red and green lines denote the variation of the potential functions

 

 

 

 

This function indicates that the minima of the potential are located at ¢=0, and
that 6 = +m (Haken et al. 1985). Given this scenario, the function can be estimated
in terms of how the potential will change in shape, as the control parameter (energy
cost) increases. Based on the observed mechanism for the point attractor with a sim-
ple function, the present model proposes the in-phase bimanual rhythmic coordi-
nation synchrony pattern as a particularly well-suited physical source. This allows a
useful reference for system stability coordination tasks in which this functional pat-
tern can be applied to all human movement, muscles, and even a neural network.
Actual intersegmental coordination, however, is additionally shaped by the contin-
gencies of adjusting to environmental vagaries. How these extrospecific requirements
and information types are incorporated into the physical stability patterns can be
assumed by the level of symmetry coordination (Amazeen et al. 1998). In order to
harmonize the effects of motor stability toward environmental symmetry, this study

investigates the following elaboration.

Symmetry breaking in bimanual coordination dynamics
The potential [V()] extends the described assumption in terms of the differ-
ence between the uncoupled frequencies of bimanual rhythmic components
[Aw = (wy — wpr)|. Where w is the preferred movement frequency of the left (wz),
right (wp) individual. If the relative phase between wz, and we were equal (Aw = 0),
this pattern would be assumed to be a perfectly identical symmetry. However, the pre-
ferred movement frequencies of the individual oscillators in in-phase are large (i.e.,
function: b/a = 0.5, detuning = — 0.5, or detuning = — 1.5), the expected stability of
the rhythmical limb oscillation dynamics become greater than equal (see Fig. 13).
Such phenomena of the symmetry breaking must be another fundamental feature of
the coordinative system (Amazeen et al. 1998). From this dynamic, a different noise of

the underlying subsystems (neural, muscular, and vascular) can be estimated around

an equilibrium point, and this might conceptualize the model when it comes to mak-
ing operational definitions of each category in which the model has to consider the
variability of the relative phase frequencies between two limbs:

» = Aw — acos ($) — b cos (2) + \/0€; (21)

The estimation of two oscillators’ relative phase (¢) is captured by the parameter (Aw)
of the preferred movement frequency of the individual segment [a cos (6) — bcos (26)]|
with the noise (./0&;). Given the equation of the preceding model (grouped as the kin-
ematics of motor stability according to the coordination task of synchronization), such a
term has been used to capture purely functional dynamics regarding the equilibria and
is confirmed usually as in the time and temporal difference between an oscillating limb.

Researchers (Treffner and Turvey 1995), conducting experiments in handedness,
advanced the elementary coordination dynamics. They added two add (sine) terms for
the coefficients, whose signs and magnitudes determine the degree and direction of

asymmetry, as follows;
= Aw — [a sin ($) + 2b sin (2)]—[c sin (b) + 2d sin (2)] + \/0€; (22)

Here, indicates a coordination change. Aw refers to a symmetry breaking through
frequency competition between two limbs. [a sin (6) + 2bsin (2)] denotes a sym-
metric coupling defined by relative phase of 0 and m attractors (this form of the term
could be derived as the negative gradient potential V with respect to ); and the
[c sin (b) + 2d sin (2¢)] terms means added asymmetric coupling attractors with the sto-
chastic noise ./o&;. This extended equation refers to the fact that the emergent elemen-
tary dynamics between limbs or limb segments was governed by a slightly asymmetric
potential of the [c sin (d) + 2d sin (26)]. That suggests extended collective dynamics of
the inter-segmental rhythmic coordination of the periodic components.

Thermoregulatory symmetry breaking of the elementary coordination

Inspired by the complementary symmetric and asymmetric influences, the described
model was applied to investigate the difference between the coupled or uncoupled frequen-
cies of the temperature-rhythmic components between the core body and circadian cycles.

c = circadian temperature cycle, d= core body temperature cycle.

where d is the preferred rhythmic frequency of one (the homeostasis cycle) and another
(c = circadian cycle) individual. Whereas b/a determines the relative strengths of the
fundamental in-phase equilibria, small values of c and d break the symmetry of the ele-

mentary coordination dynamics while leaving their essential coupling characteristics.

|cand d| > 0, lcand d| ~0

In this proposed assumption, the coefficient of the d should be more important, pro-
ducing the empirically observed perturbation in the equilibrium phase state, and then
the c should be set to zero without loss of generality, given that we cannot manipulate the
environmental circadian cycle. As one can see, if the coupling between d and c is strong
(|c and d | ~ 0), this pattern would potentially be expected to be in perfectly corresponding
symmetry with the environmental requirement. However, the preferred rhythmic coupling
of individual oscillators in an in-phase condition becomes a difference (|c and d| > 0), and
thus the expected stability or variability of the rhythmical-component oscillation dynamics
will become greater than equal. Given the preceding assumption (grouped as the kinemat-
ics of motor stability according to the coordination task of synchronization), the equation
was extended to a novel task in which there are different sources of symmetry breaking
through thermal variables, as information has not yet been made available about the effects

of bimanual dynamics in instruction on circadian temperatures.
b = Aw — [a sin (o) + 2b sin (2o)] — E sin (o°°) + 2d sin (20°) | + V/o& (23)

In this equation, in the bimanual 1:1 rhythmic coordination performed at different
coupled frequencies, the symmetric coupling coefficients will be not the same. There will
be an increase in detuning (Aw) and a decrease in the relative strengths of the attrac-
tors at O and m. However, when it comes to our limiting case of Aw = 0 on the approxi-
mately identical symmetry temperature parameters (core body and circadian cycle),
what should we expect? The final estimation between the relative phases of two oscilla-
tors (¢) will be captured mainly by the parameter of the asymmetric thermoregulatory
coupling lc sin (o ©) + 2d sin (26 ©) | with noise (./o&;). From this dynamic, the differ-
ent noise types of the underlying subsystems (neural, muscular, and vascular) around an
equilibrium point were able to be estimated, suggesting that such phenomena related to
symmetry breaking may be yet another remarkable feature of the coordinative system.

In sum, this experiment was required to have a condition of in-phase ( = 0) oscil-

lated simultaneously at the 1:1 frequency locking (the in-phase was suggested for the
Park Complex Adapt Syst Model (2020) 8:2 Page 23 of 25

main variable based on the pilot test; see Additional file 1: 2.4 and 2.5 for more detail).
The same goal using the functional symmetry dynamics of different effectors will be
influenced by the asymmetric thermal regulation symmetry breaking through both cir-
cadian temperature cycles. Namely, the effect of one of the contralateral homologous
relative limbs phase might be not identical to the impact of the others. The expected
stability pattern, from intuition given a different motor, appears to allow the biological
symmetry dynamic to be understood in the ecological context. This attunement to the

circadian temperature approach implies an emergent property of the system.
