Abstract

As the geriatric population expands, caregivers require more accurate training to handle and care for the elderly.
However, students lack methods for acquiring the necessary skill and experience, as well as sufficient opportunities
to practice on real human beings. To investigate the necessity and feasibility of care training assistant robots in care
education, we developed a simulated robot as a shoulder complex joint with multi-DOF. In this study, five experts
with years of experience in elderly care participated in the data-acquisition process, to acquire information on aspects

such as the glenohumeral angle, as well as the sterno-clavicular joint and its torque. The experts performed three
types of range-of-motion exercises: (i) elevation—depression of sterno-clavicular joint; (ii) extension and flexion of
glenohumeral joint; (iii) lateral and medial rotation of glenohumeral joint. The experimental results showed that the
quantitative results for all the exercises were significantly different between the experts. Moreover, we observed that
even experienced professionals need consistent care education based on quantitative data and feedback. Thus, we
confirmed the necessity and feasibility of the care training assistant robot for improving the skills required for elderly
care.

Introduction

Caregivers or therapists for the elderly are becoming
increasingly important with the continued development
of medical technology and the expanding geriatric popu-
lation [1]. Most students who wish to become caregivers
or therapists can receive training at school for some time
to improve their skills, whereby they can acquire caregiv-
ing experience by watching videos, reading books, train-
ing on high-fidelity medical mannequins [2-4], and/or
through role-playing to simulate caregiving for an elderly
patient [5]. However, these methods are not sufficiently
effective for improving the care training performance,
because a medical mannequin is unable to record quan-
titative data on movement, such as the joint angle, force,
speed, duration, and pressure value; thus, evaluating the

efficacy of care education for trainees becomes difficult.
The role-playing method is ineffective because a healthy
person cannot accurately simulate the actions of a patient
suffering from declining muscle strength and paraly-
sis [6]. Typically, the best training technique involves
practicing on an actual human subject. However, con-
tinuously recruiting elderly subjects for care education is
challenging, and the elderly participants may experience
fatigue or boredom from repetitive tests. Therefore, the
development of a simulated robotic device for elderly
care training is necessary.

The passive range of motion (ROM) exercise is one
most important care education task for the elderly. The
ROM exercise describes physical exercise to improve the
joint movements, which is characterized by the action
of ligaments, tendons, muscles, and the joint itself when
performing the exercise [7]. The elderly may have limited
joint movements in daily life due to stiffness, contraction
or weakness of muscles, joints, tendons, or ligaments.

Therefore, caregivers or therapists must periodically ask
the elderly patient to exercise, which may include pas-
sive ROM exercise or stretching. Unfortunately, it could
be very difficult for elderly care students to gain adequate
training and experience in performing ROM exercises
with a real subject. Therefore, the development of joint
robotic simulator becomes important, which allows
trainees and students to practice ROM exercises effec-
tively, as well as receive quantitative feedback on their
performance.

Till date, many previous studies developed simu-
lated robot for various medical training procedures.
The experimental methods for simulated robot in care
and nurse education were generally classified into three
groups such as: (i) feasibility testing of the simulated
robot (ii) correlation evaluation between the simulated
robot and a real human; (iii) performance comparison
between the experts and novices (students) when using
the simulated robot. Firstly, studies in various medical
field have examined the feasibility of simulation robots.
Fujisawa et al. [8] proposed an upper limb patient simu-
lator in practical training for feasibility testing. Their
simulator reproduced the stiffness of the elbow joint to
allow a trainee to identify the opportunities to stretch
when performing physical therapy. Mouri et al. [9]
developed and tested a robot hand with disability (con-
tracture) for rehabilitation therapist training through
distributed tactile sensors that estimates the elbow
joint torque of the robot hand. Wang et al. [10] pro-
posed and simulated an arm robot for neurologic exam-
ination training to enhance the skills of medical staff.
Huang et al. [11] proposed a simulated patient robot to
transfer the patient from bed to wheelchair, while Kit-
gawa et al. [12] presented a system of humanlike patient
robot with emotions to facilitate training in admin-
istering injections. Takashina et al. [13] and Gordon
[14] developed a patient simulator for cardiac diseases.
Wang et al. [15] introduced an arm robot for neuro-
logic examination training and assessed the survey
responses from doctors, while Takanobu et al. [16] pro-
posed a dental patient robot with questionnaire assess-
ment. Gerling et al. [17] designed a physical simulator
for clinical prostate examination training and evaluated
the training effectiveness in pre- and post-test. Ren
et al. [18] proposed a multi-joint upper limb simulator
with spasticity that can diagnose a disease, perform a
stretching exercise, and classify the stiffness result for a
patient in pre- and post-evaluation, and concluded that
the feasibility of the integrated capabilities was demon-
strated through experiments with stroke survivors and
healthy subjects. Lin et al. [19] investigated the learn-
ing transfer effect of practice on practice-similar and
practice-dissimilar skills from one patient to another

using a robot patient, and confirmed the necessity of
simulated training with robots to assist and improve
the training skills for students and novices.

Secondly, examining the correlation between a simu-
lated robot and a real human can help to evaluate the
applicability of the simulated robot. Kim et al. [20] pre-
sented a haptic elbow spasticity simulator and com-
pared the robot and in-person questionnaire results for
improving the reliability of clinical assessment. Based
on their results, they concluded that their proposed
haptic recreation of spasticity has the potential to be
used as a training tool for standardizing and enhanc-
ing reliability of clinical assessment. Huang et al. [6,
21] proposed a robot patient for nursing skills training
during stand-up and sit-down actions on a wheel-chair
during patient transfer, in addition to performing rel-
evant experimental tests. Their results revealed that
the robot patient could successfully simulate the limb
actions of a patient according to the operations per-
formed by the nursing teachers and was suitable for
nursing-skill training. However, the experimental
results varied depending on whether the patient being
assisted by the expert was a robot or a human being. In
standing up and sitting down, the maximum difference
values in the bending angle of the back of the robot
patient between experts were roughly 10° (expert 1 and
expert 4) and 15° (expert 1 and expert 2). Park et al. [22]
presented a haptic elbow robotic simulator to improve
the accuracy and reliability of clinical assessment; in
their study, four experts performed clinical assessments
on the elbow spasticity of a human patient and the
haptic elbow robot. However, the experimental result
demonstrated that the stretching speeds (6, deg/s) dif-
fered slightly between experts during the spasticity
assessment.

More recently, Noh et al. [23] compared the results
of experts and students using a patient simulated robot
assisted airway management system for physician sup-
porting, and objectively determined the operator effec-
tiveness while providing quantitative performances based
on experimental results. However, the experts exhibited
a large deviation in the results of the majority of the
parameters.

Therefore, the following two issues can be assumed to
determine the necessity and feasibility of Care Training
Assistant Robot (CaTARo) in the care education:

¢ Did experts with many years of experience partici-
pate in the care education in the same manner and
behavior?

« Did experts differ in quantitative performances when
performing the same type (exercise) of the care edu-
cation?
Lee et al. Robomech J (2020) 7:12

The purpose of this study is to design a simulated
elderly robot for care and nursing in the care education,
and investigate its necessity and feasibility. Specifically,
experts with many years of experience were participated
to experiment with some of the exercises required for the
care education. We assumed that experts will perform
care exercises in a similar movement and behavior, and
their quantitative data will not vary significantly when
the care training is performed using the proposed robot.

Earlier researches [7, 24, 25] focused on the devel-
opment of the elbow joint of elderly, while a real-time
monitoring program was developed to obtain quantita-
tive data, such as angle, torque, and pressure value of the
robot. Additionally, we have investigated the feasibility
of that system for assessment of care training from nov-
ices. This study extends the scope of our earlier study by
designing the upper limb of the robot, which has addi-
tionally developed shoulder complex joint that also con-
tains the elbow joint designed previously; and providing
additional quantitative results for investigating the feasi-
bility of CaTARo.

Hardware configuration of the proposed system

Here, we developed the robotic upper limb with gleno-
humeral (GH), sterno-clavicular (SC), and elbow joint
(EJ) based on six degree of freedom (DOF). As shown in
Fig. 1, the robotic joints of GH and SC were combined
into the shoulder complex robot. The flexion—exten-
sion, abduction—adduction, and lateral-medial rotation
of the GH joint were reproduced by combining three
servomotors, while elevation—depression and the hori-
zontal extension-horizontal flexion of the SC joint were

Page 3 of 12

reproduced by combining two servomotors. The flexion—
extension of the EJ was reproduced by one servomotor.
The symptoms were reproduced by the torque control
and the angles of six servo motors.

Joint configuration of shoulder complex joint

The joint configuration of the elderly robot is shown
in Fig. 1, which has totally six joints: three parts of gle-
nohumeral (GH-1), (GH-2) and (GH-3); two parts of
sterno-Clavicular (SC-1) and (SC-2); as well as the elbow
joint (EJ). The robot body size of the elderly person was
determined based on Human Body Properties Database
(HBPD) [26] in Japan, and was set to the average size
of an elderly person older than 65 years. Based on the
HBPD, the lengths of the upper arm and the forearm, as
well as the circumferences of the upper arm and the fore-
arm, together with the weight of the robotic elbow joint,
were set to 288 mm, 285 mm, 220 mm, 240 mm, and
0.35 kg, respectively.

These joints were designed based on the forceless joint,
because the elderly robot does not need to move actively
during the care training. The robotic GH and SC joints
were developed using six Dynamixel XM-430-W350-
R (Robotis Inc., Seoul, South Korea) servo motors.
Two 6-axis force sensors PFS303YA301 (Leptrino Inc.,
Nagano, Japan) were used to measure the torque acting
at the robotic joints. The servo motor of the GH joint
was used to control the flexion—extension, abduction—
adduction, and lateral-medial rotation of the robotic
GH joint. In addition, a 2-DOF robotic SC joint was
developed, whose elevation—depression and horizontal

flexion—extension were controlled with the SC joint as
the rotation axis.

The robotic EJ was designed based on one servo-
motor of Dynamixel MX-28 (Robotis Inc., Seoul, South
Korea), the 6-axis force sensor of CFSO18CA201U (Lep-
trino Inc., Nagano, Japan), the position angle sensor
of SVO1L103AEA11T00 (Murata Electronics Co., Ltd.,
Kyoto, Japan), and four pressure sensors of FlexiForce
A201 (Tekscan, Inc., MA, United States). In earlier stud-
ies [7, 24, 25], a robotic EJ joint was developed based on
1-DOF by controlling the flexion and extension of the
arm.

The exterior was designed using 3D CAD (Autodesk,
Fusion 360°) and created with 3D printer (Zortrax S.A
Inc., Lubelska, Poland), whose material was applied based
on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer for robust
durability, as shown in Fig. 2a, while the robot surface
was covered with a gel (hardness 0 and thickness 10 mm)
of human skin (Exseal Co., Ltd., Gifu, Japan) to reproduce
human-like tactile.

Mechanism of shoulder complex joint

We focused on three movements, such as elevation and
depression (ED) of SC joint, extension-flexion (EF) of GH
joint, and lateral-medial rotation (LM) of GH joint, as
shown in Fig. 2b. The upper limb robot simulated three
movements based on the G1, G2, and SC1 joints. The ED

Page 4 of 12

was the upward and downward movements of the shoul-
ders based on the SC1 joints (Fig. 2b, left), and the EF
movement was the arm movement of upward and down-
ward using the GH1 joints (Fig. 2b, center), while the LM
motion was to rotate the arm outward and inward by the
GH2 joint (Fig. 2b, right).

To mimic the human joints, Yamazaki et al. [27] pro-
posed the Eq. (1) of resistance torque by fitting four
parameters as pl, p2, p3, and p4.

T (9) = ePiO—p2)) _ pw3(pa—6)) (1)

where T(@) is the resistance torque (N m) of the shoulder
complex joint robot. The role of parameters p1 and p3 is
to determine the degree of resistance torque at the end
point of the joint angle, whereas parameters p2 and p4
designate the functional joint angle range. Figure 3 rep-
resents a graph of the reproduction of resistance torque
with respect to varying joint angles. Change in pl and
p3 leads to change in the graph slope. Parameter p2 and
p4 are the coefficients indicating the starting point of
the joint extension and the end point of the joint flexion.
Based on the opinions of the experts (caregivers) who
participated in this experiment, these parameters were
determined to allow the robot imitate an elderly person
and to reproduce the relevant joint movement range with
limited motion.

Experimental design

This study aims to investigate the effects of using elderly
simulated robot for geriatric care training. Even though
experts have many experiences, elderly care and rehabili-
tation are carried out empirically and subjectively. Thus,
a system is needed to quantitatively evaluate the geriat-
ric care. Here, we investigate the contribution of robots
used in the elderly care training, including the ability
to simulate the joints based on the movement range of
the elderly, and their applicability to technical train-
ing. Moreover, experiments were carried out by experts
to confirm the necessity of caring robots in the care
education.

Purpose

A feasibility experiment was conducted to validate the
performance of the proposed elderly simulated robot for
the care education as follows:

i. Did experts conduct ROM exercise using the robot
objectively when performing the care education?
Do the quantitative data obtained from the experts
vary?

ii. Could the experts be satisfied with feasibility and
possibility of the proposed robot through this pilot
experiment?

Participants

Five experts (caregiver and/or therapist) with up to
3 years of experiences in rehabilitation center and hos-
pital, were participated in this experiment, as shown
in Table 1, all of whom agreed to participate by signing

a consent form, while researchers tried to ensure their
safety. Furthermore, the entire experimental procedure
was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of
the Ritsumeikan University (BKC-2018-059).

Procedures

All experts performed feasibility experiments consisting
of three ROM exercises—elevation and depression (ED),
extension and flexion (EF), and lateral and medial rota-
tions (LM)—as shown in Fig. 4. These ROM exercises are
frequently performed for the rehabilitation of people suf-
fering from shoulder diseases. In the ED exercise, eleva-
tion and depression represent the upward and downward
movement of body structures, respectively; for example,
the depression of a sterno-clavicular joint corresponds
to the arm moving vertically downward. The EF exercise
constitutes increasing and decreasing the angle between
the two bones connected by the glenohumeral joint [28].
The LM exercise refers to the lateral and medial arm
rotations of the humeral around its longitudinal axis. The
ROM exercises were performed five times each, in the
order of ED, EF, and LM, and in certain cases, were per-
formed with the robot lying on the bed, based on certain
instructions [29, 30]. All movements started at the point
where the pre-defined joint angle was 0°.

Evaluation method

For evaluating the care skill, each of the five experts
completed the care education with three types of ROM
exercise using the elderly simulated robot. To analyze the
relationship of the results and significance effect among
experts, we used the statistical method of two-way
repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test, where, statistical analyses were performed using
MATLAB® 2019 software. The P values (probability)
were considered statistically significant when: *P<0.05
and **P <0.001. All data were expressed as mean + stand-
ard deviation.

Results and discussion

In this study, based on the obtained data, the experiment
was conducted to evaluate the necessity and the feasibil-
ity of the proposed care training robot for the care educa-
tion. Figures 5, 6, and 7 demonstrate the typical examples
of the obtained raw data of angle and torque from experts
in ED, EF, and LM, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the typical example of ED exercise
from the experts (EXP 1, EXP2, and EXP 3), which rep-
resented the angle values of 5 DOF (SC1, SC2, GH1,
GH2, GH3), and the torque values of SC and GH joints.
The obtained data from EXP 4 and EXP 5 were excluded
due to high noise. In ED exercise, the joint movements
of SC1 and GH2 were clearly represented, in which, the
experts performed each cycle of ED exercise in constant
motion range. However, the experts differed slightly in
the motion range of the joints.

The experts performed the EF exercise based on the
GH1 and SC1 joints. As shown in Fig. 6, the movements
performed by EXP1, EXP3 and EXP5 were almost the
same as each other. When EXP 2 performed the exer-
cise, however, the joint angles were not constant in the
time domain, because EXP 2 did not perform a complete

movement from flexion to extension, i.e., a contraction
was performed again after a slight joint relaxation.

In the LM exercise (Fig. 7), the results of all experts
were significantly different. The EXP1 and EXP5 had
a constant joint angle amplitude and period for each
motion cycle. The period values of EXP 1 and EXP 5 were
faster than that of the EXP 2 and EXP 3, while the EXP2
and EXP3 were observed to had a longer period of joint
rotation from lateral to medial direction.

Figure 8 shows the example of angle curves between
SC1 and GH2 during the ED exercise performance by
experts. Typically, the experts hold the robot shoulder
(grip position 1: G1) with their right hand, and the arm
(G2) with their left hand when performing the ED exer-
cise as shown in Fig. 8a. Figure 8b presents the mecha-
nism of the ED exercise, while the joints of SC1 and GH2
were involved when performing ED movement with
robot based on G1 and G2. In the depression movement,
the expert lowers the SC1 joint of the robot while low-
ering the GH2 joint simultaneously, and vice versa. Fig-
ure 9c—e shows the angle curves of SC1 and GH2 joints.
In all three tests (T1, T2, and T3), EXP 1 (Fig. 8c) and
EXP 3 (Fig. 8e) had a constant angle amplitude and

showed that the T1 movement was in the opposite direc-
tion of T2 and T3 (Fig. 8d). EXP 2 lowered the shoulder
joint (GH2) when raising the clavicle (SC1) during the
first test (T1), and raised it when lowering the clavicle
joint.

Figure 9 shows the examples of angle curves between
SC1 and GH1 during the EF exercise performance by the
experts. When performing the EF exercise, the experts

generally tend to hold the robot shoulders (G1) with
their left hand, and the arm (G2) with their right hand,
as shown in Fig. 9a. Then, the joints of SC1 and GH1
were involved when performing EF movement with G1
and G2, as shown in Fig. 9b. In the flexion movement,
the GH1 and the SC1 joints were raised simultaneously,
and vice versa. Figure 9c—e shows the angle curves of SC1
and GH1 joints. EXP 1, EXP 2, and EXP 3 had the con-
stant amplitude of angle range and the movement period

for each test. In the result of EXP 4, the subject did not
bend the robot joints as much as possible when the angle
changed from extension to bend, and moved only about
— 10 to 10 degrees, thus, exhibiting a difference from the
results of other experts.

Figure 10 shows an example of expert data in an LM
exercise. In the LM movement, experts typically hold the
robot shoulders (G1) with left hand and the robot arm
(G2) with right hand, as shown in Fig. 10a. The joints of
G1 and GH2 were involved when performing LM motion
while holding G1 and G2 as shown in Fig. 10b. In medial
rotation, the GH2 joints were rotated inward and the
GH1 joints were lowered, as the GH1 joint was raised
while rotating the GH2 joint outward in lateral rotation.
The results of the movement angle based on the joints of
GH1 and GH2 are shown in Fig. 10c-f. In all three test-
ing, although each expert showed a certain amplitude
and period for each test, the angle pattern of all experts
demonstrated a different movement.

Figure 11 shows the results of the statistical analy-
ses of ED, EF, and LM. To statistically evaluate the
acquired data, we extracted all the eleven parameters:

SC1 (MIN_SC1), minimum angle of SC2 (MIN_SC2),
minimum angle of GH1 (MIN_GH1), minimum angle
of GH2 (MIN_GH2), minimum angle of GH3 (MIN_
GH3), and the interval between consecutive cycles
(INTV). Based on these parameters, an ANOVA test
was conducted to analyze statistically significant dif-
ferences between the experts. It was observed that
all parameters except INTV (P =0.138292) in the EF
exercise exhibited significant differences between the
experts.

The findings of our experimental study suggest that
although experts have several years of experiences, they
may perform care and treatment differently from each
other. As different methods of care and treatment may
introduce a detrimental effect on the joints and muscles
of an elderly person, a customized and suitable care-
education method for individuals should be provided
on the basis of quantitative data analysis.

Conclusion and future work

The study on development of simulated robot makes
an important contribution to improve care skills of
caregivers more accurately in the care education. This
research aimed to experimentally investigate whether
there was a difference in the quantitative data results
among the experts during the care training.

Firstly, we developed the care training assistant
robot with multi-DOF at the shoulder complex joint
in the care education and training for caregivers. To
investigate the necessity and the feasibility of care
training using the proposed method, related experi-
ments were conducted with five elderly care experts,
who performed three types of ROM exercises using
the proposed system. Our findings suggested that
even experts with many years of experiences may
have different methods, thus, introducing a nega-
tive impact on care and treatment. Therefore, the
necessity and the feasibility of the care training assis-
tant robot should be utilized for the improvement of

accurate and elaborated care skills in the elderly care
education.

By considering the broader application scope of the
proposed system, however, it is evident that the experi-
mental subjects were not suitable for drawing general-
ized conclusions. Therefore, additional test subjects will
need to be recruited to perform more experiments, while
the investigation of specific medical symptoms (i.e., stiff-
ness, contracture, and muscle weakness) is necessary for
various elderly subjects. Furthermore, future research
should focus on investigating whether the usage of the
proposed system by the experts leads to improvements
to and generalization of the care and rehabilitation skills
of caregivers. Comparisons should also be made between
the results obtained from actual elderly patients and the
proposed robot patient. Finally, it is necessary to perform
various ROM exercises and care activities involving dif-
ferent postures (e.g. sitting, standing, etc.) because the
ROM exercises were conducted for a single case (lying in
bed) in this study.
