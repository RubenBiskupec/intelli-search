1. Introduction

All through the world business firms are engaged with assembling of items or conveying administration
or both perceive quality and execution as two contending factors either to enhance or keep up or recapture
their piece of the pie. To viably control and oversee quality and execution ventures are thinking about on
improvement of inventive ways and means utilizing quality administration standards with a view to plan
techniques and strategies to interest the magnificence. Any business firm may endeavor to distinguish
client necessities and deliver the correct quality merchandise/administrations to energize the clients de-
spite the fact that the points and objectives of a business may contrast. Old practices of value control and
assessment exercises have been supplanted or supplemented by quality confirmation since 1970s and by
and by, add up to quality administration (TQM) is earnestly honed in numerous associations (Dale,1999).
Prior routine with regards to quality administration varies in two particular elements from TQM: (1) rather
than basically concentrating on parts of the item or administration it grasps the entire association; (11)

instead of concentrating on extensive venture on resources it achieves social change in the association.
In created nations over 75% of the GDP is contributed by benefit areas and right now, in the vast majority
of the creating nations a similar pattern is being watched (Mitra, 2003). Be that as it may, it is intriguing
pattern that just a single fifth of the examination articles are identified with benefit segment out of the
ageregate number of articles considered the extent that exploration identified with TQM and its execution
design is concerned, both in assembling and administration segment. As behavioral angles are engaged
with conveying administration, low rate of appropriation of TQM standards in benefit division might be
credited. In a hierarchical setting desires and impression of clients are to a great extent affected by two
critical parts of TQM usage (estimation and assessment of administration quality) since they are straight-
forwardly engaged with the procedure of conveyance of administration. What's more, benefit quality is
incredibly impacted by sort and size of administration setting and interior and outside components of the
association.

A service system consisting of a series of processing stages with information flow provides variety of
services as and when required. Service systems are confronted with new pressures in evolving service
environment to offer customized services with timely delivery, high quality and more performance (Cui
et al., 2003). In addition, IT adopted service system has contributed towards improvement in market
share and ability to handle various services (Dewhurst et al., 2003). IT Demand has increased with the
development of high bandwidth telecommunications networking and database systems that allow busi-
nesses to operate in a global way (Ghobakhloo at al., 2011). Overall quality of service system depends
on many factors (Chang, 2014). During the last few years, IT adoption has generated a milestone in
banking transactions through the increased use of ATMs in developing countries like India (KPMG,
2015). Measurement and evaluation standards and procedures for quality of service systems have become
practically inconvenient (Tanriverdi, 2005). For systematic assessment of quality, it 1s desirable to de-
velop a comprehensive methodology to enable the managers and academicians to design an instrument
consisting of service quality dimensions and its related items (Yan et al., 2006). However, researchers
have noted that studies on barriers to adoption have been conducted in developed countries (Behera et
al., 2015a). A typical service system needs to be developed incorporating several IT adoption tools and
techniques to ensure its quality in changing environment and market conditions (Mwangi & Brown,
2015). Indian banking and software industry have undertaken a number of measures to make ease in
various operations (Behera et al., 2015c) In addition, the Indian government has passed legislation cov-
ering internet banking services. Despite these efforts, service delivery remains a major barrier due to poor
IT adoption (Behera et al., 2015b). In response to the concerns of Indian banks and software firm, this
research presents a development and empirical testing of a model that links the perceived level of per-
formance of service delivery systems to IT adoption (Chen et al., 2012). The objective of this study is to
examine the role of tenure, utility and vendor on IT adoption and ultimately its role on quality of service
delivery system. As the pace of development and adoption of new technologies varies between service
firms, the type of service 1s likely to influence the extent of IT adoption. In the following sections, we
discuss review of literature. We then discuss the methodology, analytical results, conclusions and rec-
ommendations of our findings.

2. Literature Review and Hypotheses

Previous literature addresses the importance of IT adoption in the quality of service firms. However, a
close look at the literature reveals that there is no common agreement among the authors on even the
definition of IT adoption, IT adoption equipment, service system design, service quality, and system
performance. In the era of e-Banking, IT-based systems are able to handle core-banking functionalities
(Peter at al., 2011). Banks are motivated to incorporate IT literacy skills among the existing bank staff to
enhance performance (Lepmets et al., 2014). Bank employee with IT knowledge caters banking services
as per the customer requirements (Hawari & Ward, 2006). With the incorporation of IT, there 1s ample
opportunity enabling organizations to succeed financially (Doha et al., 2014).
A. Behera / International Journal of Data and Network Science 4 (2020) 17

Researchers and practitioners have proposed a number of models and methodologies for measuring and
evaluating firm quality (Igbaria & Tan, 1997). Those models address operational and financial aspects
(Mikhailov & Tsvetinov, 2004). Strategies of IT adoption are required to measure system quality (Goo,
2010). The studies on the relationship between IT adoption and Reliability are conducted in either of the
two ways: empirically finding out the relationships in a given service system or proposing an analyti-
cal/mathematical model of these relationships (Yee et al., 2013). A few investigators have reported em-
pirical relationships between specific IT adoption and quality dimensions (Zhang et al., 2007; Parka et
al., 2012). The hypothesis can be formulated as:

H,: IT adoption has significant positive effect on Reliability.

In service sector, IT adoption process is directly affected by top management where all decisions from
daily functions to future investments are made by them. Knowledge and experience of CEO are important
factors for affecting IT adoption (Ghobakhloo et al., 2010). The study revealed that, the role of CEOs
(top management, owner) affect activities, both in current and in future (Durdyeva et al., 2014; Davis,
1989). The study has found that there is a negative impact on business productivity due to lack of suffi-
cient IT user employees (Southern & Tilley, 2000). Quality of service system depends upon many factors,
namely, level of IT service quality, customer attitude towards IT usage, customer satisfaction, and oper-
ational efficiency (Bruque & Moyano, 2007). Thus, it can be hypothesized as follows:

H2: IT adoption has significant positive effect on Conformance.

Online finance introduced by bank leverage state of the art technology for the convenience of customers
(Jayawardhane, 2004). Online financing has been established under Supply Chain Finance Unit (Shaik
and Abdul, 2014). Apart from the traditional banking business, banks have been strengthened to produce
variety of financial and non-financial activities (Bergendahl & Lindblom, 2008). Technological change
has been accepted by the Bankers (Arasli, 2005). Automated customer care and self-service are the main
cause to reduce costs and handle an ever-increasing number of transactions (Therrien at al., 2011). Due
to the changing demand, customers are not dependent on a single communication device (Chan & Ngai,
2010). In the shifting paradigm, customers can be expected anytime, anywhere access to services (Gus-
tafsson et al., 2003). Thus, the effect of IT on durability has been hypothesized:

H3: IT adoption has significant positive effect on Durability.

Durdyeva et al. (2014) passed on verifiable examination and the results focuses on the subjective per-
spective of customers on effectiveness and saw advantage quality. Eventual outcome of this examination,
develops a system and a movement prepare for administering productivity and saw advantage quality.
Thus, it can be hypothesized as follows:

H,: IT adoption has significant positive effect on Serviceability.

3. Methodology

A questionnaire in the form of a survey instrument was developed using the total design method (Jun &
Cai, 2010). Survey items were collected from previously published studies. The objective of question-
naire was to elicit the opinion of the respondents on the importance of the need and effectiveness related
factors (Vera & Trujillo, 2013). The questionnaire at the initial stage was sent to selected persons for
pretesting. Pilot test was done for survey instrument and selected persons were included (Table 1). Mod-
ifications were made wherever necessary and unreliable items were eliminated where ten subject matter
experts conducted a Q-sort analysis (Hussain & Gunasekaran, 2002). Then, the final version of the ques-
tionnaire was designed. A database was created by selecting all leading service industries. The sample
firms defined in the database are randomly selected.

3.1. Survey Design

The target population for this research was selected from Indian Bank and IT firms. By using the non-
probability sampling technique, a scientific stratified sampling scheme was implemented. The research
analysis was from a single branch or unit. The respondents were related with IT activities. In 2015, man-
agers from various departments in the banking and software firm with IT expertise whose standard In-
dustrial classification codes were 7371 (software firms) and 6021 (Nationalized commercial Banks) were
included as respondent titles. Stratified sampling has several potential benefits (Carmeli et al., 2008). 125
completed surveys were returned from 500 surveys that were mailed, with a response rate of 25 percent.
Units having 51 to 100 employees corresponds 40%, between 101- 200 employees 30%, and more than
200 employees rest 30%. Banking (48 percent) and IT firms (52 percent) were the respondents from the
sample. ANOVA (analysis of variance) was carried out across the two service sectors and non-response
bias was assessed by comparing general characteristics of non-responding firms (Therrien et al., 2011).
No differences were detected. Table 2 represents frequency distribution of responding firms.

3.2. Dependent variables

A set of variables were considered to measure quality of service system. Reliability, conformance, dura-
bility and serviceability are taken as functions of service quality. Reliability, conformance, durability and
serviceability are described in Table 3.

3.3. Independent variables

Survey items of IT adoption to measure system performance are presented in Table 4. Fig. 1 shows the
ANN model relating input parameters (tenure of IT adoption, utility of IT adoption, and vendor support
for IT adoption) and output parameters (Reliability, conformance, durability and serviceability) for ser-
vice system performance. There exists one hidden layer in the model.

4.1. Choosing number of hidden Layer and transfer function / activation function:

To select the best hidden layer and transfer/activation function, ANN modelling was performed for per-
formance measures. Several variations of FFNA have been considered and documented in Table 6:

01 Hidden layer NA 1,2,3
02 Hidden Neuron NA 8, 16
03 Transfer function/ Activation function Tansig, logsig, purelin & hardlim NA

Based upon the values of optimal validation quality, training R and validation R, different process pa-
rameters for ANN model was obtained. It was found that FFNA performs better than Elman and Layer
Recurrent models. In the sub sections below, effect of IT adoption upon various performance measures
(Reliability, conformance, durability and serviceability) are discussed:

Case - 1: Reliability

Effect of tenure of IT adoption, utility of IT and vendor contribution upon Reliability of quality was
carried out. Table 7 shows the process parameter setting and Evaluation parameters of Neural Architec-
ture 1.e., Validation performance, Training R and Validation R. it is observed that single hidden layer
provides the optimum results rather than multiple layers.

Using statistical methods and SPSS software, data collected from questionnaire have been analyzed. The
effect of IT on service quality was checked. Using confidence level of 95% (significance level of o=0.05),
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out. Tenure of IT adoption, utility of IT and vendor con-
tribution upon reliability of service quality has been modeled. Results obtained from ANOVA have been
verified with that of ANN modeling. Reliability linearly increases with tenure and utility (Fig. 4 (a), 4
(b)). However, vendor does not have significant effect on quality (Fig. 4 (c)).

5. Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Research

Normal probability plot for Reliability, conformance, durability and serviceability were drawn for resid-
uals. It confirms the normal distribution of the data as the graph approaches linearity. Relationship be-
tween predicted values and standardized residuals were also checked. It has been observed that, data
were distributed in both positive and negative directions and concluded that the model was adequate
having no cause to think about violation of the constant variance assumption or independence. Histogram
for all the above cases were drawn and all reflects uniform distribution around ‘0’ (mean value) and
shows conformance of the constant variance of the entire data, plotted between standard residual and
observation order. After analyzing the result of Training R and Validation Performance from the obtained
Main Effect Plots and the tabulated results of various FFNA modelling for all the performance measures,
it can be concluded that the process parameter setting of FFNA (transfer function, number of hidden
layer, number of hidden neurons) that has been tabulated in Table 5 1s optimal. With the help of specified
process parameters in the above table, final neural network model has been developed. With varying
hidden layers and learning parameter, the following observations were made:

1) Changing the hidden layers and also the learning parameter there will be a variation in perfor-
mance of ANN model, and the same has been demonstrated. It is concluded that single hidden
layer with 16 numbers of neuron gives the best result for quality.

11) The appropriate transfer function found from above analysis for hidden layer is logsig and for
output layer is tansig, which has been implemented 1n the final model.

11) In neural network modelling, increasing the inputs will have impact. In this research, the number
of input variable remains same for all the quality measures.
Quality of ANN model is mainly dependent upon the type of neural architecture, number of hidden neu-
rons, number of hidden layers, and type of transfer/activation function. In order to build up an efficient
ANN model, the focus has been given on the above critical parameters. However, increasing the number
of outputs in network, will not affect the quality of the developed ANN model as the modelling has been
done with optimal process parameter setting.

5.1 Bivariate Correlations

In order to examine the bivariate relationship, scatter plots have been formed. It has been observed that
the corresponding joint values of the variables lie along a straight line, thus a linear relationship or cor-
relation exists. No combination seems to exhibit a non linear relationship that would not be represented
in a bivariate correlation.

5.2 Testing the Hypotheses

The model developed for establishing relationship between IT adoption and quality is applied in banks
as well as software firms. Both the input variable tenure and utility bears significant positive relationship
with service quality. However, vendor bears no relationship with quality. The application of the method-
ology has been found to result in better understanding than that of the existing methodologies relating IT
adoption — service quality.

5.3 Directions for Future Research

Author identifies the following few important areas, that need further study: (1) consideration of other
‘intangible’ factors, (11) Contribution of resources, effect of intellectual apathy, leadership quality, (111)
Other services such as, hospital, hotel, airline, education may be taken into account, and (iv) Develop-
ment of suitable IT adoption and evaluation model for production firms.
