credits. The accumulated credits are then used to evaluate the level of cooperation
in the network. The selfish nodes with few credits are not able to get enough service
from other nodes. With the fair incentive, all participating relays will get equal
rewards by the trusted third party. In order to evaluate the proposed mechanism, we
also perform some simulation, and the results demonstrate that the method can be
used to support efficient routing for DIN-based sensor networks.

1 Introduction

As a kind of wireless technology, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are systems that
comprise large numbers (usually hundreds or thousands) of wirelessly connected het-
erogeneous sensor nodes that are spatially distributed across a large field of interest
[1]. There is a wide range of applications where WSNs are extensively used, and their
development in other applications is still growing. There exists a specific kind of WSN
applications in which end-to-end connectivity [2, 3] between nodes rarely exists. For
example, in the environmental and ecology observation, it is difficult to deploy WSNs
in a vast field or some special environments such as a forest or a mountainous area.
To solve this problem, we can implement the WSN based on delay tolerant network
(DTN) using autonomous air vehicle as a data ferry [4]. DTN [5, 6] has currently been

focused as a solution for communication in discontinuous networks, such as satellite

sensor network [7], vehicular sensor network [8], and mobile sensor network [9].
Therefore, DIN has become a kind of important network architecture for WSNs.
DTN-based sensor networks have a wide range of application scenarios in real life.

Due to the disruption connectivity of DTN-based sensor networks, the movement of
nodes is exploited to transfer in-transit data by the “store-carry-and-forward” strategy
and routing protocols are usually designed in an opportunistic way. Nodes usually have
short-range radios that may not allow them to connect all other nodes in DTN-based
sensor networks. Thus, nodes need to physically carry data from one location to an-
other before it comes closer to other nodes and establishes connection. Therefore, it is
more challenging to perform reliable routing in DTN-based sensor networks than typ-
ical WSNs.

Many existing studies on DTN routing protocol just depend on the hypothesis that
each node is ready to relay data to others [10]. However, in some typical DTN-based
applications, nodes may refuse to serve as data relay due to their limited resources,
such as non-rechargeable batteries, buffer space, and wireless resources. In other words,
the nodes intend to be selfish. As a result, a node may not be willing to relay data for
others. Therefore, the previous hypothesis does not work when there are selfish or even
malicious nodes and the cooperation among nodes cannot be guaranteed. Those selfish
nodes want to maximize their own benefits. For example, a selfish node may be reluc-
tant to join the forwarding that is not directly beneficial to it, which could make a de-
signed DTN routing protocol useless. Such inactive cooperation will definitely
influence the overall performance of the DTN routing protocols [11].

Specially, in certain DTN applications such as vehicular sensor networks, nodes are
distributed over a majority of mobile devices that are controlled and operated by indi-
viduals. In such applications, it is highly possible that there exist some selfish operators,
who may take selfish actions voluntarily. Therefore, a proper and efficient incentive
mechanism should be integrated for DTN-based applications in real-world scenarios
[12]. In this study, we design an incentive mechanism based on credit rewarding to
achieve more efficient performance in DTN-based sensor networks under the con-
straint of nodes’ selfishness. The major contributions of this study are as follows:

First, we propose an incentive-compatible mechanism to deal with the nodes that

want to conserve their own benefits and enjoy others service.

Second, we use some trust mechanism to avoid the problem that nodes attempt to
cheat the network, and make sure the fairness among the nodes.

The remaining sections of the study are organized as follows. Section 2 gives a com-
prehensive review of the related works. Then, we introduce the network model and de-
scribe our incentive mechanism in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. We simulate our
protocol and show the evaluation results in Section 5. Moreover, it is followed by the

discussion and conclusion with some future research directions in Section 6.

2 Related works
DTN is typically featured with relay nodes and the store-carry-forward scheme. Obvi-
ously, such scheme requires nodes to forward messages in a cooperative way. For
Mao et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:232 Page 3 of 18

example, each node should use its own limited buffer and energy [13, 14] to store and
relay messages for other nodes during the movement. Otherwise, many messages may
not be delivered to destinations successfully. However, there are some selfish nodes
among the relay nodes in real-life applications. They may exhibit selfish behaviors to
conserve their limited resources like buffer and energy, even to maximize their ex-
pected profits. Some may drop messages from their buffer after they receive messages,
or even block messages from others. Such selfish behaviors are also called non-
cooperation behaviors. It is a great threat to both the performance and the QoS of
DTN routing [15].

In order to overcome nodes’ selfishness in more suitable manner, a few existing
works analyze such behavior and evaluate different levels of cooperation. Helgason
et al. in [16] describe the benefit of node cooperation firstly and then evaluate how dif-
ferent levels of cooperation affect the delivery rate. The investigation is based on Mar-
kov chains analytical stochastic models and simulations. Balasubramanian evaluates the
performance of routing protocol in a scenario where nodes exhibit various degrees of
selfishness [17]. Li et al. in [18] take epidemic routing as an example to investigate the
performance with non-cooperation behaviors in forwarding messages. They focused on
the message delivery rate and delivery cost. The result of their research has shown that
the non-cooperation behaviors (drooping and not receiving) deteriorated the routing
performance.

The most promising way to address the selfishness issue is to enforce nodes to co-
operate by using some incentive mechanisms. Incentive mechanisms can be broadly di-
vided in three types: barter-based strategy, credit exchange strategy, and reputation
strategy. Barter-based strategy is regarded as the simplest strategy, popularly known as
tit-for-tat (TFT). The core of TFT is that two nodes will exchange the same amount of
information when they encounter each other. In other words, the principle is “TI will do
for you as much as you did for me”. This strategy ensures the fairness of exchange and
avoids selfish behaviors. Credit-based strategy uses virtual credit as the reward for for-
warding. When a node forwards messages generated by others, it will get some credits
as a return. Furthermore, virtual credit can be used to gain the services of other nodes.
In our strategy, we use reputation to indicate the degree of cooperation. If the value of
reputation is low, it means that a node is selfish, otherwise the node is cooperative. The
incentive mechanisms based on reputation can be further divided into two categories,
detection-based model and without detection model. In RADON [19] and MobilID [20],
the authors proposed some methods to detect the reputation of nodes and forward
messages according to their reputations. However, in this way, some nodes may cheat
in collusion with other nodes in order to increase their reputation. The existing works
about incentive mechanism are suitable for conventional mobile networks, like ad hoc
networks. Jaramillo and Srikant proposed a reputation mechanism called DARWIN
[21], which is designed to avoid a retaliation situation after some nodes have been
falsely perceived as selfish, so cooperation can be done quickly. Zhong et al. proposed a
system against the cheating and selfish behavior [22].

Moreover, in recent years, a few of novel mechanisms have been proposed to solve
the selfishness problem based on the unique characteristics of DTN (e.g., the unguaran-
teed connectivity). Barter game [23], one of the most popular game-theoretic models,

used an incentive mechanism to discourage selfish behavior based on barter. Similar
Mao et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:232 Page 4 of 18

with barter game, many research efforts are designed to address the problem of nodes’
selfishness by using game theory, such as incentive schemes in [24, 25]. In [26], Zhu
et al. propose a credit-based incentive scheme called SMART and consider that there
exist selfish and malicious nodes in DTN. In order to address their effect, SMART is
implemented based on secure multilayer to prevent malicious and uses credits to en-
courage selfish nodes. Chen and Chan consider that detecting selfish actions is a diffi-
cult problem. They proposed a credit-based incentive system for DTN, named
MobiCent [27] and designed a MDR (multiplicative decreasing reward) algorithm to
calculate reward. Rolla and Curado describe a new credit-based mechanism for DTN,
which uses a utility function to denote the monetary value and a buffer management al-
gorithm to prevent the selfish behavior of nodes [28]. Seregina et al. study the reward
and the time in relaying messages and design a reward policy for the source in a DIN
with two hops [29]. Furthermore, some researches try to integrate fairness and secure
idea for designing a better DIN routing. For example, Chen et al. in [30] propose a
credit-based rewarding scheme to motivate the nodes to truthfully forward the mes-
sages during every contact opportunity. Another credit-based rewarding scheme is pro-
posed by further considering that a node may get more contact information on others.
Seregina et al. in [31] propose a practical incentive mechanism for a two-hop DTN. A
reward is given only to the relay that is the first one to deliver the message to the des-
tination. Jedari et al. in [32] propose a game-theoretic incentive scheme for social-
aware routing, to stimulate socially selfish nodes in message relaying and guarantee that
the routing performance gets maximized when selfish nodes follow the scheme.

In our work, we propose a new incentive mechanism called FCIM (fair credit-based
incentive mechanism) for DTN-based sensor networks with selfish nodes. We incorp-
orate a credit-based incentive mechanism into DIN message forwarding, which differs
from previous works. We integrate the trusted third party (TTP) to make sure the fair-

ness and avoid fraud among nodes.

3 Network model and assumptions
In this section, we mainly introduce the basic network model and assumptions for our
method.

3.1 Network model

Based on the target communication environment, we assume that nodes in network are
selfish, but not malicious. They may take any selfish actions as they wish, in order to
maintain their benefits.

DTN-based sensor networks are typically characterized by the unguaranteed end-to-
end connectivity. Figure 1 presents a scenario of a simple DIN. We denote the top-
ology of the network as an undirected graph G=<V, E>, where V denotes the node set
and - denotes the set of opportunistic contact edges. Each node has a unique non-zero
identity N; in the network. We assume that each node has limited resources (buffer,
battery, etc.). We assume that a node has finite buffer space for carrying messages origi-
nated by others, but an unlimited buffer for messages originated by itself. As lack of

permanent connectivity, a temporary network consists of nodes with high mobility. In
Mao et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking —_ (2020) 2020:232 Page 5 of 18

 

 

 

Fig. 1 The scenario of a simple DIN-based sensor network

  

this model, we assume nodes’ movement is totally random. As long as nodes enter the

communication range and discover their neighbors, they will get transfer opportunity.

Messages are generated by the source nodes and delivered to the destination nodes.
As there is no permanent end-to-end connectivity, relay nodes are required to partici-
pate in forwarding. Relay nodes with wireless interface are allowed to communicate
with others in their proximity. In other words, communication opportunities emerge
when two nodes enter into the radio range. During the transmission, several copies will
be generated by relay nodes. Moreover, each copy has a time stamp indicating its time
to live (TTL). Relays can drop the copies when it becomes useless. As nodes own lim-
ited resources, they may not be willing to receive messages and help in forwarding for
others.

In our transmission model, each node acts both as the source wishing to deliver out
its own generated messages and the relay carrying and forwarding others’ messages.
We assume that each node in the network has three self-organizing actions:

1. Transfer means that a node receives data from other nodes and forwards the data
to other immediate node or the destination within the communication range. In
other words, nodes transfer data generated locally.

Non-transfer means that a node refuses to receive messages from others.

3. Drop means that a node receives data from other nodes, but it does not transfer

the data to neighbors and drop it directly.

Based on the characteristic of DTN and nodes’ own requirements, they will take dif-
ferent actions such as non-transfer and drop to save their limited resources for maxi-
mizing their benefits. However, such uncooperative behaviors have a strong impact on

the performance of the whole network and obviously reduce the overall benefits of all
Mao et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking —_ (2020) 2020:232 Page 6 of 18

nodes. In order to reduce the effect of nodes’ selfishness, cooperation among nodes
must be encouraged by some incentive mechanisms.

Compulsive cooperation mechanisms would guarantee efficient and fair operations.
Therefore, we try to introduce three primary ingredients in our incentive mechanisms:

TTP, credit pattern, and rejecting pattern.

3.2 Trusted third party

As described in the previous sections, when we design a new incentive-based
protocol, the problem of fairness must be considered. The TTP plays an impartial
role to make sure the fairness among nodes. In order to avoid the cheating in
nodes’ credit, the accumulated credits of each node are stored and updated by
TTP. Due to the cooperation enforcement mechanism and the temptation of accu-
mulated credits, some nodes may take some unfair behaviors. For example: (a)
Some nodes are likely to falsify their credits by themselves. Especially, nodes may
try to increase their credits for gaining more services by others. (b) Some destina-
tions do not pay the promissory rewards to the participants. Therefore, two major

functions of TTP are given as follows:

(1) TTP is responsible for determining the credits of nodes. The node can only read it,
but not modify it.

(2) TTP also controls the messages to be forwarded. Each message is generated with
two basic fields, source node and destination node. TTP blocks the message

forwarding to the destination with few credits.

As the network in this study is totally dynamic, it is unnecessary for TTP to be
a part of the network. On the contrary, the TTP can be a running server that acts
as a central controller. Each node can use the long-range low-bandwidth links to
communicate with the TTP for the verification and payment during the rewarding

process.

3.3 Credit pattern

The credit pattern is the key element of our incentive-based protocol. It is a scale
to evaluate the degree of nodes’ cooperation. The incentive mechanism takes
nodes’ credits into consideration for intuitively reflecting the degree of nodes’ co-
operation. Nodes’ credit value is denoted as a real number to measure the coopera-
tive behavior of a node and stored in a node table maintained by TTP. In this
table, each item is denoted in the format of [N;, value]. Cooperative behavior im-
plies how many times a node provides other nodes with required services. There-
fore, we can evaluate the cooperative behavior for node N; by [N;, CR(N;)]. All the
participants involved in transmission will get some credits as a reward, after the
messages are delivered to destinations successfully. In this way, a larger credit
value indicates higher cooperation. On the contrary, a smaller credit value indicates
lower cooperation. Moreover, the larger credit value nodes have, the more oppor-
tunity they will get for delivering their own data. Such mechanism aims to encour-
age nodes to participate in relaying messages generated by others.

Fig. 2 The credit pattern for the incentive mechanism

The basic framework of the credit pattern is shown in Fig. 2. In this figure, node

N, wants to send message to node Nj, and there exists no end-to-end path be-
tween them. Thus, some relays (N;) may participate in forwarding. To any N,, it
has knowledge about the message, such the source, the destination, and the size of
message. After several hops, the message is delivered to the destination Nj. Fur-
ther, Nz will pay the reward to TTP, and then TTP will distribute the reward to
all participants.

According to the case shown in Fig. 2, if a source node N, wishes to send data to a
destination node Nz, we can see how the credit mechanism works in detail. In order to
get a high credit, the relay node N; is willing to receive and forward data. In the head of
the data, we will record each relay’s identity (M[MID, Size, N,, N;, Ni+1,°°:, Nal) from
the source node WN, to the destination node Nz. When the data reaches its destination
Nw Ngwill confirm that the message is complete and correct. The forwarding process is
over when the destination receives the data and sends back the ACK, and then TTP as-
signs reward to the relay nodes.

Specially, to some destination Nz with few credits, the message cannot be sent from
source to any relay node. To each message, TTP will check the credits of its destination

first. If the credits are too few, it will not have enough reward to pay for relay nodes.

3.4 Rejective pattern
As an exceptional case, there are some nodes that refuse to receive messages, due to
their limited buffer size. In our incentive mechanism, we allow some nodes with high

traffic load to be selfish. Therefore, we set a threshold to measure the level of traffic

load, which is denoted as tl,,,x. When the traffic load of a node is over the threshold
(tlnax), the rejective pattern will be enabled automatically. Node can refuse any message
until its traffic load decreases under the threshold. The traffic load will be updated
every 3s by each node. Thus, each node has its own information table hold by the TTP
(see Table 1).

Let us consider a simple case. There are two relay nodes, one has a high traffic load,
and the other has a low traffic load. Messages will be forwarded by the later in priority.
Therefore, FCIM consider that nodes with high traffic load can take selfish behavior.
The detail of rejective pattern is given as below (see Fig. 3). Firstly, the routing protocol
will choose some nodes to relay messages. If there is a node N; with a higher traffic
load ti(N;) over the threshold ¢/(max), FCIM will remind the routing protocol about
that truth. Then the routing protocol may choose another candidate with lower traffic
load to relay messages.

4 Methods/experimental

In this section, we describe the incentive mechanism of FCIM with more details. It is
the responsibility of the incentive mechanism to ensure that an individual node cannot
acquire the desired services from the network unless it cooperates with others. More-
over, we also design an experimental simulation to evaluate the performance of the

proposed method and present the process in detail.

4.1 Computing credit

Node’s credit is calculated and maintained as follows. We denote node’s credit as
CR(N;), which refers to the degree of cooperation. To each node, it has an initialization
constant value of credit called CRini, which is a non-zero value. Node has no right to
modify its CR(N;), and just owns the read-only permission. Only the TTP can perform
the modification operations like subtracting, adding, etc. When a message is success-
fully delivered to the destination Nz, Nz needs to reward all the relay nodes that partici-
pated in forwarding the message. Thus, nodes are encouraged to participate in
forwarding for increasing their CR(N;). When a message is delivered, the destination
will generate and send the ACK, which contains the messages ID, the source node ID,
the destination node ID, and the list of relays (M[MID, S, N;, N; +1, +++, D)).

In FCIM, the destination pays the reward to the TTP, and then participants are
assigned reward by the TTP. We assume that each message is equally important. How-
ever, the message with an extra size is an exception. In our incentive mechanism, we
have a threshold to control the size of messages. If the destination receives an over-
sized message, it needs to pay an extra reward denoted by exp. The value exp is calcu-
lated by Eq. (1), where x refers to the extra size, and y refers to the reward for per unit
of extra size. Thus, the TTP will decrease the destination’s credit (CR(Nz)) according to
Eq. (3), where RE(N) refers to the amount of reward Nz should pay to the relays.
RE(N,) is calculated by Eq. (2), where f refers to the reward Nz should pay with normal
size messages. The delivery of messages decreases CR(Nz) until it goes to zero. Once
the CR(N;) of a node goes down to zero, no other nodes will forward messages origi-
nated from that node and also it cannot receive any message from others, because the
forwarding services cannot get any reward for relays. In this case, that node is regarded

as a Selfish one.

exp = K*y (1)
RE(Na) =B+ exp (2)
CR(Na) new — CR(Na) oi — RE(Na) (3)

Furthermore, FCIM considers that all relay nodes are equally important during the
process of forwarding. The list of relays is recorded on the message head. Thus, the re-
ward that each participant gets is equal, and noted as RE(N;). RE(N;) is calculated by
Eq. (4), where c refers to the count of relays in the list. When the message is delivered,
and the destination sends the ACK to the TTP, the TTP will update the credit of each
participant, according to Eq. (5).

rE(w,) = Na) (4)
CR(Ni) new — CR(Ni) ota + RE(Ni) (5)

According to the above credit mechanism, nodes have to cooperate with others in
order to get more credits and obtain services from others. As long as the credit of a
node is greater than zero, it is able to pay the reward.
Mao et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

(2020) 2020:232

4.2 Cooperation enforcement

In FCIM, cooperation is mandatory according to the rewarding incentive mechanism.
In our assumption, each node may require two kinds of service, (a) destination nodes
want to receive messages that are sent to them and (b) source nodes want to send their
messages to destination nodes. If nodes want to ensure their services, they have to in-
crease their credits. In this case, nodes have no choice but to receive and relay mes-
sages. For relay nodes, once they receive messages, they must forward them in order to
get rewards from destinations after delivering. The credit mechanism of FCIM will
force nodes to cooperate with others in order to get more credits and obtain services
from others.

In the network, each node holds a number of messages in its buffer space. Nodes
carry and forward them to other relay nodes or deliver them to the respective destina-
tions. A relay node may also forward the replicas of the same message to several nodes
in order to increase the delivery rate. Similarly, for selfish nodes, they may forward the
same message to more nodes in order to earn more rewards than it actually deserves.
Such behavior will cause flooding in the network. Many existing routing protocols in-
tend to avoid flooding. They are designed to select finite optimized nodes to relay mes-
sages. Therefore, the purpose of our incentive mechanism is to optimize the delivery
rate without flooding. Therefore, we will perform FCIM after the routing. In other
words, we require the nodes that are selected by the routing protocol to relay messages
compulsively. Moreover, the TTP and rewarding process will not produce extra over-
head on message delivery.

Figure 4 gives a detailed routing process with FCIM. When the source node generates
a message, the TTP will check the CR(Nj) of the destination firstly. Only when CR(N,)

is over the maximum expected reward that the destination needs to pay, the source is

able to send the message successfully. Then, the routing protocol will select (by node

selector) the optimized relay nodes iteratively until the message is delivered to the des-
tination. The task of relay selection just depends on what kind of routing protocol we
used for the network. Moreover, if there is a selected node with high traffic load, the
rejecting pattern of FCIM will remind the sender to select alternative nodes. When the
message is delivered to the destination, it will pay reward to each relay node under the
coordination of the TTP.

4.3 Experimental simulation
In order to evaluate the performance, we simulate our incentive mechanism in
ONE (opportunistic network environment) simulator [33]. In our simulation, we
set an initial credit value CR, for FCIM. This allows each node to deliver at
least 3 pieces of messages before its credit value goes down to zero, and it can
earn its credits by relaying others’ messages at the same time. Also, we set the
maximum traffic load for node tl,,, to 90% of the node’s buffer size in simula-
tion. When the traffic load of node N; (tly,)) is over tlnax, N; can refuse to re-
ceive any message. In addition, the remainder of the parameters used in
simulation is given in Table 2.

In this simulation, we mainly focus on evaluating the performance with four metrics
[32]: delivery ratio, delivery delay [34], overhead, and hop count. We evaluate the in-
centive mechanism from the following two aspects:

(1) Compare the performance of the routing protocol with and without the incentive
mechanism.

(2) Evaluate the incentive mechanism with three different scenes.

We implement the FCIM based on the prophet routing protocol and epidemic rout-
ing protocol to evaluate the performance. We perform the simulation in a real urban
movement environment in this part .

In order to evaluate how FCIM works in optimizing performance, we perform several
experiments by changing the cooperation varying from 0 to 100%. Table 3 summarizes
the major parameters used in the simulation.

In order to confirm the validity and adaptability of FCIM, we compare the performance
of prophet routing with FCIM and without FCIM in three different scenes, Infocom06 [35],
Random, and RollerNet. Infocom06 data set recorded the 3-day data transmission between
78 portable Bluetooth devices and 20 static devices. RollerNet data set was derived from a
group trip in the wild, recording the data transmission between 62 iMote-equipped nodes

5 Results and discussion

5.1 Evaluation for different operations

The result of the performance evaluation with and without the incentive mechanism is shown
in Fig. 5. Figure 5a illustrates the message delivery rate for two routing protocols with and
without FCIM. The delivery rate is high when the cooperation value is large. However, with
the cooperation decreasing, the delivery rate of protocols without FCIM declines quickly,
while the protocol with FCIM preserves a higher delivery rate. The result of delivery delay is
given in Fig. 5b. Delivery delay [36] refers to the time consumption for forwarding messages
from source to destination, and we use the average delivery delay in the simulation. According
to Fig. 5b, it is ea sy to get the conclusion that FCIM is able to restrain selfish behavior. More

nodes participate into forwarding, so the delay time does not increase obviously. Similarly, the

protocols with FCIM take fewer hops during the forwarding process (see Fig. 5d). Hop count

refers to how many relay nodes are involved in forwarding a message from source to destin-
ation. Obviously, if more nodes are willing to relay messages, the messages will be forwarded
to destination more quickly. Figure 5c depicts the overhead for these two protocols with and
without FCIM. Overhead is used to evaluate that how much the network resource is con-
sumed [37]. We can see that the trend of the protocols with FCIM is much similar to the one
without FCIM. It is mainly because that the incentive mechanism makes more nodes carry

the copies of messages. This behavior also increases the burden on the network.

5.2 Evaluation for different scenes

The result of the performance evaluation in three different scenes is shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8
and 9. Figure 6 shows the delivery rate in three different scenes. Obviously, the delivery
rate of Prophet routing with FCIM is higher than the one without FCIM. This is the result
by using the incentive mechanism, and some selfish nodes are urged to participate in for-
warding for accumulating their credits. Therefore, more messages are successfully deliv-
ered to the destination nodes.

Figure 7 shows the delay in three different scenes. When we adopt FCIM, the average
delay time is clearly short. Apparently, when nodes actively participate in forwarding,
the messages will be forwarded much more quickly.

We can find that prophet with FCIM has lower overhead in Fig. 8. Its trend is similar
to prophet without FCIM. The former takes traffic load of node into account during
the forwarding, so it keeps efficient at a lower level of overhead and thus saves the net-

work resource.

Figure 9 shows the hop count in three different scenes. Because the prophet routing proto-
col forwards messages to nodes with high probability and FCIM forces nodes to participate
into forwarding, most messages are delivered to destinations by fewer relay nodes. As the

structure of Infocom06 and RollerNet is relative dense, the performance of the
both protocols (with and without FCIM) show little difference in different scenes.
We have compared the performance of the same routing protocol (prophet) with and
without FCIM in three different scenes. The structures of the three scenes are totally differ-
ent, so the simulation results are also quite different. Generally, the routing protocol with
FCIM performs better than that without FCIM in all the three scenes. This result has veri-
fied the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method in different environments.

5.3 Evaluation for different incentive schemes

We also compare the performance of FCIM with two existing methods with similar incen-
tive schemes, MobiCent [27] and SMART [26]. According to the results in Fig. 10, it
seems that FCIM performs better than the other two schemes, although the overall per-
formance is very close for the three schemes. Figure 10a illustrates the message delivery
rate for the three schemes and Figure 10b depicts the overhead for the three schemes.

All the three schemes have used an incentive mechanism to solve the problem
nodes’ selfishness. However, both MobiCent and SMART take the mechanism of
pay-by-source. It means that the credits are paid by the source node. All the relay
nodes on the path will then share the total credits provided by the source node in
advance. In contrast, we use a different strategy called pay-by-destination and it
means that the credits are paid by the destination node that has received messages.

This strategy seems to be more reasonable, because the destination node does not
have to calculate the payment in advance. The destination node will know how
much it should pay after receiving messages. Therefore, we can determine the
credits dynamically in our method.

6 Conclusion
This study presents a fair credit-based incentive mechanism called FCIM for DTN-based
sensor networks by optimizing the activity of selfish nodes. The proposed incentive mech-
anism considers that encouraging selfish nodes to cooperate is as important as tolerating
reasonable selfish behaviors. On one hand, FCIM is able to guarantee high delivery rate to
destination and makes sure that nodes are hard to cheat by using a credit pattern. On the
other hand, FCIM allows nodes to have some specific selfish behaviors by using a rejecting
pattern. Meanwhile, we implemented the simulation based on ONE simulator, and the re-
sults show that FCIM is able to optimize the routing performance and motivate more
nodes to participate in forwarding.

This work considers some specific selfish behaviors in forwarding. In the future, we
need to consider more patterns of selfish behaviors and take more attributes of nodes
(e.g., energy, security) into account. Therefore, we can design a more comprehensive

incentive mechanism for DTN routing.
