1.1. Background

ABSTRACT

Demand-side response (DSR), via price signals (e.g. tariffs) or via direct load control (DLC), is recognised
as vital to the network operations with high levels of renewables. This study aims to measure the interest
in electricity tariffs and acceptance of DLC, conducting a survey of 622 households and to identify the
socio-demographic and dwelling characteristics associated with the decisions. Firstly, cluster analysis
identified four DSR preferences: conservative (19%), reserved (20%), agreeable (34%) and flexible (27%). A
multinomial logistic regression test showed that dwelling type, tenure, employment, and education
influence DSR preferences. Secondly, ANOVA test showed that the interest in tariffs was significantly
different across socio-demographics such as age, gender, and education level. Thirdly, we found that the
acceptance of DLC is higher for devices (e.g. heat pumps, electric boilers, PV systems, home batteries)
than appliances (e.g. tumble dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, EVs). Chi-square tests showed that
employment status, presence of children, gender, age are significant factors for the acceptance of
appliance DLC whereas it was dwelling type and education level for devices. These findings highlight the
heterogeneity of DSR preferences, thereby pointing to challenges such as perceived control, and socio-
technical dynamics are key to achieve high participation in such programmes.

challenges to the management of the distribution network. Several
case studies have shown that with a given penetration level, the
presence of PV may arise challenges in distribution systems such as
load congestion [7,8], and network losses [9,10]. Considering the

As part of the global energy transition, there is an increase in
self-generation (175 GW capacity increase in roof-top photovoltaics
(PV) in 2018) [1], storage (increase of 1.1 GW deployment of in-
home batteries in 2018) [2], number of electric vehicles (increase
of 63% from 2018) [3], and electrification of heating (3.7 million
heat pumps sold worldwide in 2019) [4]. These changes are intro-
ducing many unknowns and new challenges to the operation and
planning of electricity systems in terms of the hardware side and
the control architecture [5,6]. The increasing variability in energy
supply and bi-directional flow of energy introduce significant

intermittent nature of the renewable technologies, integration of
demand flexibility is recognised as vital to the operation of the
distribution networks to tackle the above-mentioned challenges
[11—14]. Major ways to provide this flexibility include energy
storage and demand-side response (DSR) [15]. Of these, demand
side response is recognised as the less capital-intensive approach to
help system balancing [16].

Element Energy (2012) describes demand-side response as
‘change in electricity consumption patterns in response to a signal’
[17|. Two main types of signals are price signals via time-
differentiated electricity tariffs and controlling signals via direct
load control (hereafter DLC) contracts. For the first type of signal,
consumers are incentivised to change their consumption patterns
through price signals delivered via time-varying electricity tariffs in

which the price of electricity varies depending on factors such as
the wholesale price of electricity and electricity network con-
straints. The electricity tariff structure includes a volumetric
component (price/kKWh). Examples are time of use tariffs (i.e. price
of a kWh varies between periods with the highest price being for
the on-peak period); real time pricing (i.e. reflecting wholesale spot
prices and grid usage ratios, hence change hourly and daily); and
power tariffs, also referred as capacity tariffs in literature, (i.e.
charging according to the peak demand in price/kW during a
period) which reflects the network costs associated with the peak
power demand [18—21]. For the second type of signal, unlike pro-
grammes that rely on price signals, DLC programmes involve third
party provider (e.g. utility companies) requesting operational
control via signals over customers’ specific household appliances
(such as electric hot water systems, heat pumps or air conditioners
especially in the U.S.) for a limited time period [22—24].

Electricity tariffs with price signals do not require a firm
commitment by the consumer to adjust consumption at specific
times, but leave it to the consumer’s discretion, how and when to
react to the price signals given. An extensive body of work dem-
onstrates that consumers adjust consumption at specific times to
different tariffs [25—28]. Regarding the consumer demand for
electricity tariffs, a detailed international review and discussion of
the acceptance of time of use tariffs is provided by Nicolson et al.
[29]. They show that the uptake could be as low as 1%, enrolment
could reach up to 43% with the marketing effort. On the other hand,
the uptake of dynamic tariffs ranged between 5% and 28% across
nine U.S. trials [30]; Fell et al. [31] found that willingness to
participate in dynamic pricing is the lowest among all tariffs in the
UK. Power tariffs are also reported less popular than time of use
tariffs [29]. Many researchers have argued that DLC programmes
could offer a more reliable source of demand flexibility by
providing greater certainty over the amount, timing, and location of
demand flexibility than solely depending on the households with
price signals [32—36]. However, whilst DLC programmes have been
available for decades worldwide, early trials suggest that partici-
pation rates have not been satisfactory [37]. Stenner et al. [37]
presented that the customer enrolments in DLC programmes in the
U.S. ranged from 0.11% to just 14.54%.

Research that has examined participant responses to the pros-
pect of various DLC applications offers a mixed and complex picture

of user acceptance. Murtagh et al. [38], reported that ‘most par-
ticipants interviewed were unlikely to agree to DLC, even if finan-
cial compensation is offered [39]. While other researchers show
that users would be more open to DLC with an overriding option
which allow the users bypass the automatic setting [40,41 ]. Factors
that affect the customer engagement in DLC programmes are
identified as i) trust and transparency between the aggregator and
the customer [42,43], communication with the customers such as
framing the need for automation [38,44—46], overriding opportu-
nities [23,39,47—50], adequate compensation [31,38,51], concerns
around privacy [45,52—55] and perceived lack of control [23,37,41 ].
These researchers investigated the public acceptability in general
terms; or only focused on one device (e.g. air conditioners) [23].
There is still limited evidence whether the acceptance changes
across different types of electrical devices and appliances.

Several researchers also discussed combining these signals to
increase the reliability of implicit demand side flexibility provided
by the households [56]. For example, Parrish et al. [57], reports that
trials with automation technologies alongside pricing had a 15%
higher rate of response than schemes with pricing alone. Further-
more, Stromback et al. [58] shows that automation increases the
level of peak clipping for all types of variable tariff except for real
time pricing. Nicolson et al. [59] found that dynamic time of use
(ToU) is ‘most effective when combined with additional equipment
that reduces peak demand by automatically turning off non-
essential electrical devices’. However, evidence on the acceptance
of DLC devices linked with interest and acceptance of electricity
tariffs is limited.

1.2. Aims and objectives

To address the abovementioned gaps, the objectives of this
study are:

- To identify distinct DSR preferences (i.e. interest in tariffs and
acceptance of DLC of individual electrical devices) via cluster
analysis

- To discover how socio-demographics and dwelling characteris-
tics influence these DSR preferences

- To research how socio-demographics and dwelling character-
istics relate to i) interest in tariffs and ii) households’ acceptance

of DLC and vary across different types of electrical devices and
appliances

- To explore the relationship between interest in tariffs and
acceptance of DLC

This study takes an important step towards the estimation of
interest in electricity tariffs and DLC programmes across different
types of devices and appliances in relation to socio-demographics
and dwelling characteristics. We apply the k-mean clustering ma-
chine learning technique to analyse DSR preferences in Swiss
households. We use multinomial logit regression analysis to
determine how socio-demographic characteristics influence these
DSR preferences. We apply statistical analyses (ANOVA and yy? tests
of independence) to test the differences in interest in electricity
tariffs and DLC acceptance across devices and socio-demographics.
The findings contribute to designing better tariffs and DLC pro-
grammes across different customer subgroups.

2. Method
2.1. Survey measurement

The survey was originally developed in French and then trans-
lated into German. The customer database of a public utility in
Switzerland in the canton of Fribourg and Neuchatel, Groupe E,
which is performing the role of distribution system operator (DSO)
was used to distribute the survey to its customers. The customer
database consists of the e-mail addresses of bill payers therefore
the respondents are accepted as the responsible person of the
household. The response rate of the survey was 12.4%. 622 people
out of 5000 fully completed the survey with no missing informa-
tion. The survey was anonymous, and no personal identifiers were
collected.

2.1.1. Dependent variables

The first dependent variable of the analysis was the interest in
pricing tariffs. Each respondent was presented with six different
tariffs and asked to indicate their level of interest in each tariff. The
second dependent variable was the willingness to accept DLC for
the four electrical devices including heat pumps, electric boilers, in-
home batteries, roof-top photovoltaics (PV) systems and four
electrical appliances namely tumble dryers, washing machines,
dishwashers, and electric vehicles (EV).!

2.1.1.1. Interest in tariffs. The levels of interest in each tariff were
estimated from participants’ responses on a 4-point Likert-type
scale: 1) Not interested at all, 2) Slightly interested, 3) Interested
and 4) Very interested. The tariffs mentioned in the survey were
explained with a sentence and an example (Table 1).

2.1.1.2. Acceptance of direct load control (DLC). To measure the
willingness to accept DLC programmes, participants were asked
whether they would allow the utility company to pilot their elec-
trical devices and appliances: “In order to keep network costs low
and manage situations of high network demand, it may be useful
for Group E to be able to control certain devices remotely (limita-
tion, curtailment or start-up). which devices would you accept that
Group E could control remotely? Please select one response per
line.” The participants were instructed to choose between “yes,”
“maybe,” and “no” for each device/appliance.

1 In this study, device is defined as piece of equipment made for a particular
purpose (e.g. heating, cooling), whereas appliance is defined a non-manual appa-
ratus or device used to perform functions (e.g. washing, driving).

2.1.2. Independent variables

This section describes the variables that are used as the
grouping variables/predictors in the y? tests of independence,
ANOVA, linear regression, and clustering analysis. Table 2 shows
the socio-demographic characteristics, dwelling characteristics,
and appliance/device ownership that were considered as influ-
encers of the interest in electricity tariffs and acceptance of DLC.
The table also shows the descriptive information with percentages
for the variables. Regarding the appliances, PV is explained as the
‘installation of electricity production (Photovoltaics system)’.* In-
home battery is explained as ‘electricity storage battery’ to the
survey respondents.

2.2. Overview of analyses

Table 3 presents an overview of the analyses performed in this
study and the samples and data used in each analysis. A cluster
analysis was conducted first in order to identify the groups of
households that display similar DSR preferences (interest in tariffs
and acceptance of DLC). A multinomial logit regression is then used
to explain the composition of clusters obtained in the previous step.
Later, ANOVA and 2 tests of independence were performed to
investigate the socio-demographics and dwelling characteristics for
individual DSR preferences separately and individually. ANOVA test
is then performed to link the acceptance of DLC of electrical devices
and appliances to interest in electricity tariffs. Finally, OLS is con-
ducted to link the overall DLC acceptance with the interest in
electricity tariffs.

3. Results
3.1. Overview of DSR preferences

3.1.1. Interest in tariffs

Fig. 1 shows a) the percentages of participants who chose
different interest levels and b) the means and standard deviations
calculated based on the 4- Likert scale. Highest average interest was
in the bonus tariff (M = 2.77, SD = 0.88), followed by the progres-
sive tariff (M = 2.59, SD = 0.87). The average interest for other
tariffs were, in decreasing order, dynamic tariff (M = 2.12,
SD = 0.97), malus tariff (M = 2.06, SD = 0.90) and fixed tariff (M =
2.02, SD = 0.91). Lowest average interest was in the power tariff
(M = 1.79, SD = 0.86).

3.1.2. Acceptance of direct load control

Fig. 2 shows the percentages of participants who chose “yes,”
“maybe,” or “no” to the DLC over the electrical devices/appliances
regardless their device/appliance ownership. Survey results show
that people’s willingness to accept DLC depended on the particular
appliance/device type. Specifically, the acceptance rates were
higher than the rejection rates on devices including electric boilers
(58% yes, 23% maybe, 18% no), heat pumps (57% yes, 28% maybe, 15%
no), batteries (47% yes, 28% maybe, 25% no), PV systems (45% yes,
30% maybe, 25% no). On the other hand, the rejection rates were
higher than the acceptance rates on appliances including washing
machine (25% yes, 22% maybe, 53% no) dishwasher (23% yes, 27%
maybe, 51% no), tumble dryer (30% yes, 24% maybe, 46% no) and
electric vehicle (27% yes, 30% maybe, 43% no).

3 Gender was only recorded for the person who filled the questionnaire. This
person is also the responsible person of the household for paying the electricity bill.

2 Roof-top PVs are the most common PV installations in Switzerland [67]. All
building integrated PVs are installed with an inventer in accordance with the norm
established by the government [68].

Table 1
Explanations of electricity tariffs mentioned in the survey.

Fixed tariff:

Each client chooses his/her category of the tariff and pays a fixed price. For example, ‘Medium consumer fixed price’ which corresponds to an average consumption of
4500 kWh pays 1000 CHF per year. In case of higher consumption, it jumps to the ‘Large consumer fixed price’ which is 1500 CHF per year.

Power tariff:

This bill depends on the highest power you demand within the year (i.e. highest consumption of 15 min). For example, in February, while your heat pump is running, and
you use three hobs, an oven and a washing machine at the same time; its power is then 13 kW and your annual bill will be 1300 CHF. If you use two hobs, the power

demand would be 11 kW and your bill will be 1100 CHF.
Progressive tariff:

The first kWh consumed are less expensive than those which exceed a certain threshold. For example, you pay 20 ct/kWh for the first 1000 kWh and 25 ct/kWh for kWh
above this threshold. The annual bill for an average household (4500 kWh) then would be 1075 CHF.

Bonus tariff:

The price per kWh is fixed at 23 ct/kWh throughout the year. However, if you manage to consume when there is a lot of electricity supply available and little consumption
(in the afternoon, in summer), Group E pays you a bonus of 5 ct/kWh. For example, an average household consuming 4500 kWh per year of which 500 kWh in summer
between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., will pay 1035 CHF.- annually and will receive a bonus of 25 CHF.

Malus tariff:

The price per kWh is fixed at 22 ct/kWh throughout the year. However, if you consume when there is little electricity supply available and a lot of consumption (e.g. in the
evening, in winter), Groupe E charges you a penalty of 10 ct/kWh. For example, an average household consuming 4500 kWh per year, of which 500 kWh in winter

between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., will pay 990 CHF annually plus a penalty of 50 CHF.

Dynamic tariff:

The price of your consumption is dynamic and thus varies from hour to hour and from day to day. For example, the price is different between 8 h and 9 h, between 10 h and

11 h, etc. The price of an annual household bill is therefore difficult to predict.

3.2. Clusters of DSR preferences

The cluster analysis is based on the 14 features that we defined
for DSR preferences. These are namely interest in (1 )fixed tariff, (2)
power tariff, (3)progressive tariff, (4)bonus tariff, (5)malus tariff, (6)
dynamic tariff, and acceptance of DLC of (7)heat pumps, (8 )electric
boilers, (9)in-home battery, (10)PV system, (11)tumble dryer, (12)
washing machine, (13)dishwasher and (14)EV. Since the responses
were on different scales (i.e. interest in tariffs on the 4-point Likert
scale and acceptance of DLC were recorded as acceptors (1 = yes),
in-between (0.5 = maybe) and rejectors (0 = no)), we used minmax
normalisation to normalize the value of each feature (Equation (1 )).
Otherwise, features with a higher variation would have higher
impacts on the clustering results.

K-means clustering was applied using standard Euclidean dis-
tance as the similarity metric, using the implementation in the
scikit-learn Python package [60]. The silhouette score [61], defined
in Equation (2), was used to determine the optimal value for “k”.
The silhouette score has a theoretical range of [-1, 1], and a score
close to +1 indicates a better performance of the clustering algo-
rithm i.e. low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity)
and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity). The
“k” that has the highest silhouette score will be considered as the
optimum number of clusters for our dataset.

normalised value =

; b—a
silhouette score = max(a,b) (2)

where:

a = average intra-cluster distance,

b = average shortest distance to another cluster.

The cluster analysis of the households’ DSR preferences yielded
four distinct groups: Cluster 1 (conservative, 19%), Cluster 2
(reserved, 20%), Cluster 3 (agreeable, 34%) and Cluster 4 (flexible,
27%). As shown in the violin plots in Fig. 3, the DSR preferences are
clearly distinguishable (average silhouette score = 0.31). Table 4
presents the clustering results and the position of each cluster in
the space spanned (i.e. mean values of the 14 DSR preferences
features).

Cluster 1 (conservative) exhibited generally low interest in

tariffs except for progressive and bonus tariffs. Cluster 1 also
expressed low willingness to accept devices/appliances DLC pro-
grammes. Cluster 2 (reserved) exhibited relatively higher interest
in tariffs compared to Cluster 1 (conservative), however they were
more open to DLC of certain devices (two subgroups for heat pumps
and boilers) and they were very open or potentially open to DC of
appliances (again two subgroups). Cluster 3 (agreeable) showed
similar interest in tariffs compared to Cluster 2. They were open to
DLC of more electrical devices. Finally, Cluster 4 (flexible) exhibits
Slightly higher interest in different tariffs as well as highest
acceptance of DLC of electrical devices and appliances.

3.3. Predicting clusters based on socio-demographic characters

To investigate the socio-demographic and dwelling character-
istics associated with the cluster membership of DSR preferences,
multinomial logistic regression models were conducted. The results
further provided the probability of each household being assigned
to a particular cluster. Multinomial logistic regression models
calculate the probability that household iis assigned to cluster kas
shown in Equation (3):

| fork=1(referencecategory)
1+, exp (x;6;)
Pr(yj=k|x;)=
exp(x;8x) fork=2 3
14>, exp (x;6;)

(3)

where x; is a row vector of independent variables for household i,
and 6; is the vector of coefficients for cluster k [62].

Since the coefficients of a multinomial logistic regression model
are difficult to interpret per se, marginal effects were computed
according to the common practices. The marginal effects can be
interpreted as the change in the probability of an individual case (a
household in our study) being assigned to a particular cluster with
a one-unit increase in the independent variable [62]. For binary
variables (e.g. tenure as renter and owner), marginal effects indi-
cate the changes in probability as a result of the binary variable
changing from 0 to 1. The marginal effects of each variable on the
different clusters sum up to zero by definition. We report only the
marginal effects obtained in the logit model in Table 5 (y? = 86.36,

Cluster 1 (conservative): Higher education categories (namely
Degree II and Degree III) are under-represented in this cluster.
Households in Cluster 1 are also more likely to live in a house than
in an apartment.

Cluster 2 (reserved): Households in Cluster 2 are more likely to be
renters living in houses. These households are also more likely to
include women however less likely contain people who are home
based (i.e. unemployed and housewife/husband).

Cluster 3 (agreeable): Households in Cluster 3 are more likely to
own their property and live in an apartment.

Cluster 4 (flexible): Households that have home-based re-
spondents are more likely to be included in Cluster 4 compared to
other clusters. Additionally, Households in Cluster 4 are also more
likely to live in an apartment than in a house.

3.4. Socio-demographic characteristics of interest in tariffs

To further examine the DSR preferences individually and sepa-
rately, a series of one-way ANOVA tests was conducted to compare
only the interest in different tariffs across different socio-
demographic groups (Table 6). Whenever the F value is signifi-
cant, indicating that there is at least one group differing from one of
the others, Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests were further performed to
identify those groups.

ANOVA test results show there was a significant difference be-
tween age and the interest in power tariff and progressive tariffs.
The post-hoc tests show the eldest (more than 65 years old) stated
the highest interest in power tariffs (M = 2.07, SD = 0.96) than
youngest (18—35 years old) (M = 1.78, SD = 0.86). Conversely, the
youngest (18—35 years old) stated the highest interest in progres-
sive tariffs (M = 2.78, SD = 0.84) than eldest (more than 65 years
old) (M = 2.54, SD = 0.86). Women stated significantly higher in-
terest in four tariffs namely fixed, power, progressive and malus
than men. Regarding the education, post hoc comparisons using the
Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean interest of participants
with Degree I in tariffs such as fixed (M = 2.58, SD = 1.00), power
(M = 2.28, SD = 0.85), bonus (M = 3.09, SD = 0.69) and malus
(M = 2.25, SD = 0.88) were significantly higher to participants with
Degree III (fixed (M = 1.96, SD = 0.88), power (M = 1.64, SD = 0.84)
and bonus (M = 2.71, SD = 0.89)). Conversely, participants with
Degree III stated higher interest in malus tariffs (M = 1.96,
SD = 0.88), than to participants with Degree I (M = 1.96, SD = 0.88).

Participants who live in an apartment were significantly more
interested in power tariff (M = 1.88, SD = 0.86) and bonus tariff
(M = 1.71, SD = 0.84) than to those participants who live in a house

(power tariff (M = 2.86, SD = 0.86) and bonus tariff (WM = 2.68,
SD = 0.89)). Regarding the tenure, participants who are renting
were more interested in progressive tariffs (M = 2.72, SD = 0.82) to
those who own their dwelling (M = 2.51, SD = 0.90).

There was not a significant difference between the presence of
children, number of people and interest in tariffs. Finally, none of
the socio-demographic characteristics differ significantly in dy-
namic tariffs.

3.5. Socio-demographic and dwelling characteristics of acceptance
of DLC

This section addresses how the acceptance of the DLC of each
device/appliance differed in their socio-demographic and dwelling
characteristics to provide information that can help utility com-
panies better match customers with the right type of incentives. A
set of II” tests of independence were conducted to find out whether
there is any significant relationship between acceptance of device/
appliance DLC and socio-demographic characteristics. Only signif-
icant values were shown in the table.

As shown in Table 7, for electrical devices, which are less related
to daily activities and practices, the differences were mainly related
to dwelling type, education, ownership of the corresponding device
and gender of the person responsible in the household for elec-
tricity bill. For other socio-demographic characteristics such as
employment, presence of children, household size (number of
people), age and tenure, there was no significant difference in the
acceptance of the DLC of the electrical devices.

Regarding the dwelling type, both apartment and houses have
different superscripts for “no” (superscript a) and “yes” (superscript
b), so we can conclude that the percentages are significantly
different. This means that a downward trend was observed from no
to yes in the houses for the DLC of electrical devices, whereas an
opposite trend was observed for apartments in which more people

accepted the DLC of these devices. Similarly, people with higher
education (Degree III) were significantly more likely to accept the
DLC of heat pumps and batteries than reject it. The acceptance of
DLC of boilers was significantly higher for those who already owns
it. For PV, on the other hand, PV owners were significantly less in
favour of DLC of their PVs than non-owners. This can be explained
by the fact that these households have been selling power to the
grid therefore they can see the DLC of their PV as an obstacle to
their profits.

On the other hand, for electrical appliances (relatively more
related to activities and daily routine), the differences in acceptance
were mainly related to socio-demographic factors such as
employment status, presence of children, gender, number of people
in the house, age and tenure (Table 8). For other socio-demographic
characteristics such as dwelling type and education, differences in
the acceptance of the DLC of the electrical devices were not sig-
nificant (hence not shown in the table). Employed people and
households with children are likely to reject the DLC of tumble
dryers and washing machines. For tenure, there is downward trend
from no to yes in the owner-occupied households for the DLC of
washing machines and dishwashers, whereas an opposite trend
was observed for rented homes in which more people accepted the
DLC of these appliances. The acceptance of DLC of dishwashers was
significantly lower for those who already owns them compared to
non-owners. Lastly, the relation between acceptance of DLC of EVs
was significant, 7 (N = 622) = 7.706, p = .021. Men are more likely
to accept the DLC of EVs whereas women are more likely to reject it.

3.6. The relationship between interest in tariffs and acceptance of
DLC

A series of one-way ANOVA tests was conducted to compare the
interest in different tariffs across acceptance of DLC of different
device and appliance types (Table 9), Whenever the F value is sig-
nificant, indicating that there is at least one group differing from
one of the others, Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests were further per-
formed to identify those groups.

Results of ANOVA test suggests that there is a significant dif-
ference between the acceptance of DLC and the interest in the
tariffs except for fixed and dynamic tariffs. Participants who indi-
cated “yes” to acceptance of DLC were significantly more interested
in tariffs than other respondents. Conversely, participants who
indicated “no” to acceptance of DLC always significantly stated the
least interest in any tariff.

Additionally, we conducted an ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression analysis for the overall acceptance (the number of yes to

The regression model is statistically significant (F-values and p

values are stated in Table 9) in power, progressive, bonus and malus
tariffs. Participants who have accepted the DLC of higher number of
appliances are more likely to state more interest in these tariffs in
general (i.e. By. are positive). Lastly, there was not a significant
10 S. Yilmaz et al. / Energy 212 (2020) 118712

difference between the acceptance of DLC for EVs and the interest
in tariffs.

Given the fact that objectives of power tariffs and DLC align in
the sense of minimising the peaks in the electricity demand to
avoid the high strain on the grid, the results here are worth of
particular attention. Results of ANOVA test show that there is not a
significant difference between acceptance of DLC of four devices
individually (e.g. heat pump, boiler, in-home battery and PV) as
well as EV DLC and interest in power tariffs. On the other hand,
those who accepted the DLC of washing machines, tumble dryers
and dishwashers showed significantly more interest in power tar-
iffs than those who rejected the DLC. Regarding the dynamic tariffs,
though not significant, the interest by those who accept the EV and
device DLC tended to be lower than those who reject the EV and
device DLC.

4. Discussion

We highlight below five main findings and several key sugges-
tions which could be of interest to utility companies, DSOs and
policy makers.

First, our findings highlight the heterogeneity of DSR prefer-
ences, not only at an overall level but also with regard to specific
patterns across various DSRs. The cluster analysis identified four
distinct DSR preferences: conservative (moderate interest in
different tariffs but low acceptance of device/appliance DLC),
reserved (moderate interest in different tariffs and moderate
acceptance of device/appliance DLC), agreeable (moderate interest
in different tariffs and high acceptance of device DLC but low
acceptance of appliance DLC) and flexible (higher interest in
different tariffs and high acceptance of device DLC and appliance
DLC). Our analysis further makes it possible to relate DSR prefer-
ences with individual characteristics (e.g. education level,
employment, gender) and dwelling types. This provides a basis for
pilot testing the potential of different electricity tariffs and DLC over
various electrical devices and appliances in future field studies. Our
consumer profiles should thus be of great value to utilities inter-
ested in introducing new electricity tariffs and DLC programmes.

Second, in terms of electricity tariffs, this study found that the
majority of households indicated significant interest in at least one
of the novel electricity tariffs. Meanwhile, power tariff (i.e. paying
based on the power demand, in CHF/kW) was the least preferred
tariff in general in line with literature [29]. Yet, demographics such
as elderly (over 65 years), women and those who live in apartments
showed higher interest compared to the other groups.

Third, this study identified significant differences between the
acceptance of DLC for devices and appliances. Socio-demographic
factors such as employment status, presence of children, gender,
household size, age and tenure had no impact on the acceptance of
device DLC (e.g. heat pumps, electric boilers, PV systems and in-
home battery); however, they were significant determinants for
the acceptance of appliance DLC (e.g. washing machine, tumble
dryer, dishwasher and E.V.) which are more related to daily rou-
tines and practices. For example, families with children are less
likely to accept DLC over washing machines, tumble dryer and
dishwasher. Further, we infer that the type of activities associated
with a particular appliance (especially how closely the activities
connect with daily routines and practices) interrelated with
household demographics and affect acceptance of DLC of such ap-
pliances. Therefore, the underlying socio-technical dynamics that
affect the acceptance of DLC must be taken into account in order to
decrease the level of inconvenience and should be addressed with
several offers (e.g. overriding) as part of the DLC programmes.

Fourth, although the acceptance of device DLC was generally
higher than appliance DLC, it is important to highlight that the

acceptance of the DLC over these devices was significantly lower for
house residents compared to apartment residents. We suspect this
is related to “the need for control” as house occupants are the only
owners of these systems as opposed to apartment occupants who,
for example, share one heat pump in the whole building. Apart-
ment occupants might have become used to the feeling of not
having full control over appliances or devices. This finding is also in
line with the work of Xu et al. [40] that the acceptance of DLC
programmes of air-conditioners increased for house residents once
the overriding option is given. In Switzerland, the ownership of
heat pumps and PVs in houses (i.e. single-family households, SFH)
are significantly higher than apartments (i.e. multifamily buildings,
MFH). In 2018, 15% of SFH and 9% of MFH were equipped with heat
pumps [63] while 9% of SFH and 6% of MFH were equipped with PV
systems [64]. Hence, utility companies should think of offers such
as Ovetriding options to tackle the concerns regarding losing con-
trol in order to increase the participation of the single-family
households in DLC programmes of electrical devices.

Lastly, results of ANOVA tests using demographics as the
grouping variables suggested there was no significant difference
between the acceptance of DLC over EVs and devices (e.g. heat
pumps, electric boilers, PV, batteries), and interest in power tariffs,
whereas the difference was significant for the acceptance of
appliance DLC (tumble dryers, washing machines, dishwashers).
Since devices are likely to cause higher levels of strain on the grid
(e.g. high peak demand of heat pumps, and feed-in by PV systems),
public authorities and DSOs should address this misalignment,
provide guidance and promote the device DLC which will reduce
peak demands, reduce the customers’ bills, and at the same time
better reflect DSO costs.

In this paper, we highlighted the non-technical factors such as
interest in different electricity tariffs and acceptance of DLC pro-
grammes, however technical challenges including lack of metering,
information and communication infrastructure, as well as the need
for advanced computational methods [65,66] are equally important
to holistically evaluate the impact of DSR schemes on the electricity
system.

5. Conclusion

In this study, we applied machine learning techniques such as k-
means clustering, multinomial logit regression, and other statistical
tests (ANOVA &II’* tests of independence) to analyse the DSR
preferences in residential households. Specifically, we focused on
socio-demographic and dwelling characteristics to predict the dif-
ferences in DSR preferences combined and individually.

The cluster analysis identified four distinct DSR preference
groups: conservative, reserved, agreeable, and flexible. A multino-
mial logit regression was then applied to 622 households to link
their socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. age, presence of chil-
dren, and education level) and dwelling characteristics (e.g.
dwelling type) with the group which they belong to. The results
suggest that characteristics such as dwelling type, education level,
tenure, employment and gender are strong determinants of the
DSR preferences.

The surveyed customers are most interested in the bonus tariff
and least interested in the power tariff. Further, the interest in
tariffs was significantly differed across socio-demographic charac-
teristics such as age, gender and education level. At the same time,
we found that the acceptance of DLC is higher for electrical devices
(e.g. heat pumps, electric boilers, PV systems and in-home batte-
ries) than for electrical appliances (e.g. tumble dryers, washing
machines, dishwashers and EVs), arguably due to the desire of
maintaining daily routines. Somewhat in support of this finding, we
found socio-demographic variables (e.g. employment status,
S. Yilmaz et al. / Energy 212 (2020) 118712 11

presence of children, gender, age) serving as significant predictors
of the acceptance of appliance DLC on the one hand and dwelling
type and education level serving as significant predictors of the
acceptance of device DLC on the other hand. In bridging DLC
acceptance with the interest in tariffs, we found that those who
accept DLC of devices/appliances did not show high interest in
power tariffs. It is important to align DLC programmes with power
tariffs which reflect the network costs better in order to reduce the
bills by avoiding maximum peaks. Therefore, we suggest further
research should be done in order to understand the relationship
between DLC and power tariff acceptance.

In summary, this paper provides a basis for developing advice
and guidance for DSOs, utility companies and policy makers that
would enable households to participate in tariffs and DLC pro-
grammes for the future planning of Swiss distribution systems with
increased renewable power generation. We observe significant
differences in households’ interest in tariffs and acceptance of DLC,
and we suggest that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in the
design of electricity tariffs and DLC programmes. Our analyses
provide some initial insights in the reasons for the aforementioned
differences, while future research is warranted. It would certainly
add another layer of depth to the decision model if socio-
psychological variables (such as frugality value, environmental
value, trust in utilities, social influences, and comfort needs) were
also included. Further research with a multi-dimensional frame-
work, which incorporates the financial with the social and the
technical with the mental, is required to investigate and to promote
the acceptance of DLC.
