1. INTRODUCTION

Robots have been applied for industrial production in the 1950s with the role of replacement of human
labor, improving the product quality and the efficiency of production. There are common missions, which
the robot address very well, such as manufacturing, material handling, and painting, etc. Recently, robots are
more and more playing an important role in life and industrial production. Therefore, it is very important to
develop the performance of the robot application. There is some research on robot control [1-3], the controller
that is most used for the robot is the proportional—integral—derivative (PID) one. However, because of
the nonlinear characteristic of the robot, so the PID controller is not suitable, the effectiveness is low.

There are some nonlinear methods for robot control, for example the linearization technique [4],
the back-stepping control method [5], etc. However, these methods have the drawback, 1.e., the control signal
has the chattering. A number of approaches have been contributed to robot control, which includes adaptive
control [6], optimal control [7], robust control [8], and intelligent control [9, 10]. Whereas, these mentioned
methods endure some shortcomings that is the complexity of the computation. In order to minimize this
limitation, fuzzy control, which is considered an efficient and simple solution, was utilized based on
the experiences of a human [11, 12] but its sustainability is quite low. With the intention of enhancing
sustainability, the fuzzy control associated with the PID controller was presented [13, 14], however,
the deficiency of this proposal is that the output response is not quick.

The study [15] introduced a sliding mode controller to solve the above constraints. In recent years,
the sliding mode controller, which is powerful in controlling both linear and nonlinear objects, has been
examined by various researchers. Emelyanov and his co-workers first introduced this method in the early
1950s. This controller offers some advantages involving the quick output response, the robustness and stability,
the simple control algorithm, and the good transient performances. However, the limitation of the sliding mode

controller is the high frequency chattering of the control signals, which leads to undesirable loads on control
actuators [16, 17]. In order to diminish the above cons, the author presents the control system for the two-link
robot arm using the fractional-order sliding mode control.

The fractional-order sliding mode controller is a sliding mode controller where the order of sliding
surface is a fractional value. The fractional-order sliding mode controller has many advantages compared to
the traditional sliding mode controller. It can even control the objects with uncertain dynamical model [18].
Hence, recently, the fractional-order sliding mode controller has been investigated and applied into many
system controls such as: single-link flexible manipulator [19], antilock braking systems [20, 21], speed control
system for permanent magnet synchronous motor [22]. As a result, the systems with the fractional-order sliding
mode controller are of superior quality to traditional controllers. Because of the above advantages, in this paper,
based on the dynamic model of the two-link robot arm, the author will build a suitable fractional-order sliding
mode controller and prove the stability of the whole system through the theory of Lyapunov. The achieved
findings will be transparently displayed through Matlab Simulink. The results will indicate that there is not
a high-frequency chattering in the control signals as well as a static error, the quality of the control system is
adequate, and the response angle of two links quickly approaches the desired angle.

The remains of the paper are as follows: Section 2 presents the calculus of derivatives and integrals
of fractional order, the kinematic equation of two-link robot arm, and the fractional-order sliding mode
controller. Section 3 presents the results and analysis. Finally, The conclusions are presented in section 4.

2. DESIGNING THE CONTROLLER
2.1. The calculus of derivatives and integrals of fractional order

Leibniz and L’Hopital propose fractional calculus on the basis of the integer-order calculus
in 1695 [23]. The first-order derivative is determined by the (1):

bY) = Nim FOLEM
f ) = lim (1)

Therefore, the second-order and n-order derivative are determined as follows:

fX(t) = lim SOE ® = jp FOAL EF (C= 20) -F (C=3) ©)

f(t) = lin () (4)

where:
n\ _ n!

In (5), is a natural number. If n = z is not a natural number, (5) is rewritten as follows:
Z\ _ [(z+1)
(7) ~ FG+DI(z -i+1) (6)

where I'(. )is the gamma function.
For generalizing, Riemann-Liouville and Caputo have defined the fractional order for the calculus of
derivatives and integrals as follows [24]:

 

(n)
f= fae @ adr (7)

[(n-z) °9 (t-1)2t"-1
where: I'(z) = f 0 t?-*etdt,n-—1<z <n (nisan integer value). If z < Othen the calculus (7) is integration,

else if z > 0 then the calculus (7) is differentiation. Especially, if z = 1 the calculus (7) is first order derivative
function.

Choosing Lyapunov function V = =?

If the control signal is set up according to the equation (12), s = —K.sign(s). We have:
V=s.s =-—K.|s| < 0Vs

Thus, the system will attain the asymptotical stability at the equilibrium point s = 0, which indicates that e and
all derivative of e will equal zero.

Figures 5 and 6 show the time characteristics of Link! and Link2 respectively. Each characteristic
includes the desired angle@,,,, the response angle(@), and the error(@,,, — 0). The outcomes of simulation
demonstrate that: firstly, the response angles are not equal to the expected angles, then the response angles
meet the expected values after a short time (approximately Is), and finally, the response angles always adhere
the desired values, the errors (€,, e€2) are zero. Accordingly, it can be asserted that the control system has
a high quality. The control torque of each joint is shown in Figure 7. The simulation results show that there is
not the chattering phenomenon of torques, which is necessary for the system to assure the sustainability of
actuators and devices.

4. CONCLUSION

In the present research, the author gained success in establishing the control system for the two-link
robot arm utilizing the fractional-order sliding mode controller. The simulation outcomes displayed that
the control system has remarkably high quality, the response angle of two links always reaches the desired
angles in a short duration and the static error equals zero. Notably, the chattering phenomenon does not exist
in the torques and therefore the lifespan of the controller and actuator is increased. Since the algorithms of
the controller are analyzed specifically, the proposed controller is established quite easily in practice.
The success of this proposed algorithm is the basis for the authors to conduct experiments in further studies.
