transmission has experienced major failures as compared to other mediums of fiber
transmission infrastructure. The failure is rampant, and especially the cable get cuts
frequently in areas where there are road constructions, road road expansion projects,
and other developmental projects. The cost of repairing these failures is enormous, and
it largely depends on the cause of failure and the geographical area the faults occurred.
The main aim of this paper was to investigate the cost of repairing underground fiber
cable failures, clustered the cause of faults, and then used feedforward neural networks
(FFNN) and linear regression to predict the cost of repairing future faults. The result of
the predictive model is significant to the telecommunications industry, which means
the cost of repairing an underground optical networks will be known to the industry
players before the fault occurs. depending on which area, the cause of the failure and
the mean time to repair (MTTR), the predictive model tells the mobile network opera-
tors the cost involved to repair the damaged cable. The accuracy of the result obtained
indicates the predictive model is good for predicting the cost of repairing fiber cable
cut in underground optical networks.

Introduction

The two most common outdoor fiber optic cable installations are aerial installation
and underground cable installation. Underground cable installation is buried directly
underground or placed into a buried duct. Underground burial of fiber cable installa-
tions is mostly common for long-distance installations. The cables are usually buried
in trenches. Underground duct installation also provides an opportunity for future
expansion without the need to dig again. Preparation towards underground cable

installation requires the adherence to certain outlined guidelines which includes
obtaining proper right-of-way permits, Identify existing underground utilities such
as buried cables, pipes, Investigate the soil condition to determine the installation
depth, whether duct should be used and the type of fiber cable to be used [1].

The cost of deploying underground fiber cable is extremely expensive. The depth
of the underground fiber cable installation is between 1 to 2 m. The soil conditions
and its type determines the depth the fiber cables should be buried. In colder areas,
fiber cables are typically buried below the frost line to prevent the cables from being
damaged by ground frost heaves. Through forests, rivers, drylands, etc. fiber cable has
been laid in a seemingly protective manner. These protections are usually not sufh-
cient to prevent the cut of the underground cable [2].

Previous research works have shown that fiber cables were more likely to be cut
in rural areas, even though urban areas have a higher number of cables cuts [1, 2].
Cutting the underground fibre optic cables causes service interruption leading to a
considerable inconvenience to businesses and home users. Underground fiber cable
cuts reduce network reliability, affects customer experience on the network. The cut
also increases the service provider’s operational costs which further reduces rural
network expansion, affects last mile connectivity strategies, and it also incurs a high
maintenance cost [2]. The cost of maintenance or repairing cuts in an underground
cable is very expensive [3]. This paper sought to determine the cost of repairing fiber
cable cuts by using K-means clustering for failure classification and FFNN to predict
the cost of repairing fiber cable in the future. Knowing the cost of repairing a faulty
underground cable by the industry players helps them to budget and plan ahead of
failures.

First, we considered the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of the underground
fiber transmission links. We assume this basic unit to be the minimum length between
the transmitter and the receiver. Values for MTBF are hard to obtain from literature.

Fiber networks are repairable systems with a mean time to repair (MTTR). The
values of the MTTR depend on a variety of factors such as duct type (aerial, under-
ground or submarine cable), failure location (city area or rural/hard-to-reach areas),
kind of the damage and, of course, reaction and completion times defined in the con-
tracts with the responsible repair companies. In the instances stated the use of MTTR
values in the range of 1 h (Best case) to 4 h (worst case) [4]. Assume both MTBF and
MTTR to be the same throughout the network. Thus a fiber transmission link unit
has availability = MTBF/MTBF+ MTTR.

Case description

The failure is rampant, and especially the cable gets cuts frequently in an area where
there is road construction work, the road expansion project, and other developmen-
tal projects. The cost of repairing these failures is enormous, which prompted this
paper to investigates the impact of underground fiber cable failures, cluster the cause
of faults, and then used feedforward neural networks (FFNN) and linear regression to
predict the cost of repairing the faults. The predicted value will inform the industry
players to know the cost involved in repairing any faults outlined in this paper.

Literature review

The cost prediction this work entails using machine learning and deep learning models,
for instance, neural networks and K-means to obtain the expected result. ML algorithms
receive and analyze input data to predict output values. They improve their performance
while being fed with new data, collect and analyze high volumes of data about fiber cable
cuts. Deploying of ML modelling is a new research area, so no literature has so far been
identified concerning the topic presented in this paper. However, there were few works
of literature which provided a cost-effective predictive model in big data process and
the quality of result [5]. Ahmadvand and Goudarzi [6], also presented their simulation
a quick and effective mechanism to rank portions of big data processing steps for cost-
effective purposes. The warehouse-scale computers used more time- and cost-efficiently
process data, or process partial data with optimized approximation concerning resource,
time and energy limitations. Ahmadvand and Goudarzi [6] showed that different data
portions, from the same or different sources, have different significance in determining
the outcome of the computation, and hence, by prioritizing them and assigning more
resources to the processing of more essential data. A cost-effective predictive model
using adapting genetic algorithm was adopted by Padhy, Singh and Satpathy [7] to pre-
dict the fault tolerance in web service applications.

In an optical network transmission system, the cost of installation and deployment of
cables and plants is quite expensive. However, critical protective measures have been
adopted over the years to safeguard the various component in the optical transmission
ecosystem from damage. That notwithstanding, negligence on the part of some organi-
zations and developers have lead to the destruction of many optical cables. When cables
are destroyed by known or unidentified developers, the affected mobile network opera-
tor (MNO) has to fund the repairing of the optical cable quickly. This situation has lead
to unimaginable loss of funds to the MNO, which arguably increases the Capex of the
MNO. The optical cables are mostly buried underground for a long-haul transmission
system. When a cut occurs in the underground cable, the technician team are required
to dig up the cable and repair it. The cost of repairing a fault in an underground opti-
cal cable is unknown to the MNOs. The use of machine learning to predict the cost
of repairing a fault in fiber optic cable has not attracted the attention of the scientific
research community. This study uses the ML model to predict the cost of repairing cuts

in underground optical cables.

Hard failures in underground optical networks

Despite the massive infrastructure and the meshed optical networks built to support
the deployment of the services, mobile network operators (MNOs) continue to suffer
fiber cable cuts, which disrupts service quality and interrupts service to users. Hard
failures are referred to as the physical damage to the underground fiber optics cable
such as cable breaks or cuts due to several activities [1, 2]. The telecommunications
industry in Ghana records a monthly average of 200 underground fiber cable cuts,
which affect close to 38% of all network interruptions leading to the obstruction of
quality of service targets annually. The cuts of underground fiber cables reduce the

optical network availability, affect customer experience, and increases the MNOs
Nyarko-Boateng et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:64 Page 4 of 16

cable repair costs. The rampant underground cable cut further reduces rural network
expansion and affects last mile connectivity strategies [1-3].

Private developers and road construction are the leading cause of the destruc-
tion of underground fiber cables. Additionally, drainages, dig-ups and other utility
service organizations which access the road reservation corridors have contributed
immensely to the underground fiber cable destruction. It is crucial to note that con-
tinuous cuts in underground fiber cable result in degradation of the optical signal as
a result of the additional splicing joints due to constant repairs. This phenomenon
severely affects the quality of service (QoS). In ensuring QoS, MNOs are confronted
with the challenge of replacing long spans of fiber cables to eliminate the multiple
splicing joints, and this comes at huge costs and extended time in restoring network
outages [2].

Other developing nations such as Nigeria, Kenya, India, etc. have experienced similar
hard failures in the underground optical networks. Studies have found that underground
fiber cables were more likely to be cut in rural areas, even though several unapproved
activities in urban areas have accounted to a higher number of fiber optic cables destruc-

tions in a given area [1, 3].

K-mean clustering
k-means algorithm is an iterative algorithm that attempts to partition the dataset into K
pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups called clusters, where each data point
belongs to only one group. The algorithm cluster data points as similar as possible while
also keeping the clusters as different as possible. The algorithm then allocates data points
to a cluster in such a way that the summation of the squared distance between the data
points and the cluster’s centroid. The less variation obtained within clusters, the more
homogeneous the data points are within the same cluster. The clustering technique is
one of the most common exploratory data analysis techniques used to get an intuition
about the structure of the data. In this paper, the K-means algorithm deployed grouped
the dataset into C,, clusters [8].

Let C,, ..., C, denote sets containing the indices of the dataset in each cluster. These
set satisfying two properties, according to [9]:

C,UC,U...UC,=iL..., n}, each data belong to one of the K clusters.

If the ith data is in the Kth cluster, then i € C, cluster C;, is a measure w(C;) of the
amount by which the data within a cluster differ from each other as derived by [10] in
Eqs. (1), (2), (3) and (4) ie:

is the mean for feature j in the cluster C;, which minimizes the sum-of-squared devia-
tion. However, the coefficient of deviation or separation took the values in the interval
[—1, 1].

If it is O, then the sample is very close to the neighbouring clusters.

If it is 1, then the sample is far away from the neighbouring clusters.

If it is — 1, then the sample is assigned to the wrong clusters.

Silhouette analysis was used to determine the degree of separation between the clus-
ters. That means the distance from all data points is in the same cluster (k). When the
average distance from all data points in the closest cluster (C,) [10, 11].

Hence, the computation of the coefficient has been given in Eq. (5) as:

Feedforward neural networks
Feedforward neural networks fundamentally consist of three layers, which are the input
layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The FFNN model has one hidden layer with mono-
tonically increasing differentiable functions, which has the ability to approximate the
continuous function with the hidden layer [12]. The FFNN model used in this paper has
two input neurons and a hidden layer with two nodes, which comprise of the data col-
lected from the field, which are the determinants of the cost of fiber cable repairs. The
input variables include the cause of a fault and the area/region it occurred [13].

The output of the FFNN for the input pattern Z, was computed with a multilayer
forward pass through the network. According to [14] each output unit, O,, is given in
Eqs. (6), (7) and (8) as:

Ok, p = fok (net oxy) (6)

where f,, and f,; are the activation functions, O, is the output unit, y, is the hidden
unit, W,, is the weight between the output unit O, and the hidden unit y,, Z;,, is the value
of the input unit z; of the input pattern z,,

The (I+ 1)th input unit and the (J+ 1)th hidden unit were the bias units representing
the threshold values of the neurons in the next layer within the hidden layer [15].

The machine learning model designed for our predictive model has been shown in the
figure. After applying the transform function to Eqs. 6, 7 and 8, our predictive model
now has x, X, and x, as the input variables of the mode with )7;"_ (x;w;) being the acti-

vation function [16], as shown in Fig. 1.

Research design

According to Ghana Chamber of Telecoms [1], the leading MNO in the country expe-
rience 2000 underground fiber cable cuts in every 6 months and other MNOs suffers
about 1500 cuts over the same period. Averagely, 200 cable cuts are recorded monthly,
which mostly affects close to 38% of all network infrastructure. The study was designed
to collect the necessary data for simulation, testing and evaluation. Weka 3.8 machine
learning simulation tool was deployed. Weka is a collection of machine learning algo-
rithms for solving real-world data mining and big data problems. We used Weka for our
simulation because it is an open-source machine learning software with a good graphi-

cal user interface, standard terminal applications and contains built-in tools for standard

machine learning tasks, and additionally gives transparent access to well-known tool-
boxes such as sci-kit learn. In all, 4111 datasets on fiber cable cuts were collected from
the eight regions in Ghana, where the cuts of the fiber cable are predominantly high. The
regions are R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8. The distribution of causes of fiber cable
cut in each region has been shown in Table 1. The datasets were collected over 4 years,
thus, between January 2015 and December 2019. The research was designed.

Description of causes of fiber cable cut
Road expansion: Deliberate action which is taken to increase, extend or broaden the
existing road.

Road construction: A project that involves the creation of a new road and drainage
system.

Private developers: Any individual, firm, corporation or entity, other than a nonprofit
corporation, limited profit entity, or public corporation who acquire buildings or land in
order to construct or refurbish building projects on the site.

Cable defect: This is a fault which is caused by internal damage of an underground
fiber cable.

Water pipe laying: Laying pipes along or across the road.

Rodent chewing: When animals deliberately chew part of the underground fiber cable.

Dig ups: When electricity power companies dig trenches to mount electricity poles
and the road.

Railway construction: When existing track infrastructure receives an expansion or a
new track is under construction.

Table 2 presents the distribution of the cause of fiber cable cut against the total fiber
cable cuts throughout the observation period and the cost of repairing each fault.
According to the referenced table, the cost of repairing a fiber cable cut caused by a road
expansion, road construction, private developer and so on is $3800, $3800, 4200, 4400
respectively. Table 3 shows the total fiber cable cut in each region throughout the obser-
vation period and the total amount spent on repairing those faults. Table 3 revealed that
region 1 (R1) recorded the highest cable cuts followed closely by region 5 (R5), with the
least cable cuts occurring in region 8 (R8). The pattern of the cause of cable cuts and
its associated cost of repairs were critically examined and modelled to give an accurate
cost value by using machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering, FFNN and

linear regression. By simple accounting and mathematical computations, the cost of
repair can be made known to the MNOs. However, the use of machine learning model-
ling provides a better result quickly with preciseness and exactness.

The cost of repairing faulty underground fiber cable largely depends on the cause of
cut, the location, the MTTR, and the texture of soil where the cable has been buried. The
location could be dryland, across the road and waterloo. The soil texture is sandy, rocky
and clayey. All these factors directly affect the cost of repairs and even may cause delays
in tracing the fault [17, 18].

The graphical representation of the predictive model has shown Fig. 2a, b. The cost of
repairing a faulty cable largely depends on the cause of cable cut and at which location
the event occurred. The higher the MTTR, the larger the cost of repair of the fault. In
Fig. 2a, it has been indicated that the highest cost of cable repair was in R2, which was a
result of a considerable number of cable cuts within the period of observation [18].

However, Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the cost of repair against the total cables for
each cause of the cut. It has been established in Fig. 3 that road construction was the
highest cause of cable cut which also accounted for the total highest cost of repairing

cable cuts.

Conceptual model for the prediction of cost

The paper collected data from the field in eight regions. The field datasets included the
cause of fiber cable cuts, the distance of cuts, time of cuts, etc. The cost of repairing a
fiber cut according to the Ghana Chamber of Telecoms is $3000. The datasets were inte-
grated and pre-processed by data selection, data cleansing, and data normalization. The
cleaned dataset was partitioned into 80% training dataset and 20% test dataset, as shown
in Fig. 4. K-means clustering, FFNN and linear regression were the machine learning

algorithms [19] with sigmoid activation in the Weka library were applied to the datasets

to classify and predict the cost of repairing cut cables. The iterative characteristic of an
ML model is very significant in the sense that as the ML model is exposed to new data-
sets, they can adapt autonomously. The model quickly learns from the previous compu-
tations of the cost of repairing faults and cause of the cable cut to produce reliable and
high accurate results. We adopted the ML technique to simulate our work because of its
ability to classify, integrate and train new dataset into the predictive model to produce
the expected output. The ML model was carefully chosen to aid in providing good accu-
racy in our cost prediction research.

The cost of repairing fiber cable cut (y) = the cost of repair + the revenue lost* MTTR

MTBF

(11)

MTBF is the average time elapsed from one failure to the next [41].

MTTR is the average time taken to repair faults after a failure. In Ghana, the MTTR
for fault repair is <4h.

Calculating actual MTBF requires a set of observations of fiber cable cuts; each obser-
vation is:

Uptime: The moment at which an optical network began operating (initially or after a
repair).

Downtime: The moment at which an optical network fail operating as a result of cut

since the previous uptime-moment.

So each Time Between Failure (TBF) is the difference between one Uptime_moment
observation and the subsequent Downtime_moment.

Three quantities are required:

n=number of observations. u;= This is the ith Uptime_moment. dj= This is the ith
Downtime_moment following the ith Uptime_moment.

So Mean Time Between Failures=)> dit , for all i=1 through v cable cuts. More
simply, it is the total working time divided by the number of failures.

Discussion and evaluation

The K-means clustering technique applied to the dataset produced final cluster cen-
troids are shown in clustering Table 4 and Fig. 3. Table 4 present two main cluster in
the clustering process; Cluster 0 and Cluster 1, respectively. The clusters have the same
attributes which have been represented by Region, Cause of cut and Cost of cut repair.
Figure 5 shows the graphical representation of the various clustering and the degree of
association. Silhouette analysis was used to determine the degree of separation between
the clusters and the distance from all data points in the same cluster.

The Classifier model (full training set) produced the result which made the cluster-
ing of the fiber cable cut, causes of cut and the cost of repairs a goon one. Tables 5, 6, 7

correlate with the pattern of the clustered input data. The predicted cost [25-27] of repair-
ing an underground fiber cable cut, according to the model, can be determined when vari-
ables such as region and cause of cuts are known. The empirical machine learning model
[28] we used in this paper requires an update of recent fault variables to be able to predict

the actual cost of repairing the cable.

Results evaluation

Two main evaluation metrics were adopted to measure the performance of the predictive
model. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean squared error (RMSE) were the
two metrics used to measure the accuracy of the predicted cost of repairing fiber cable cut.
The accuracy rate obtained was perfect for the predictive model. MAE measured the aver-
age magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions whiles RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule
which was deployed to measure the average size of the error.

Both MAE and RMSE expressed average model prediction error which means metrics
ranged from 0 to oo and are indifferent to the direction of errors. The matrics are nega-
tively-oriented scores, which means lower values are better. Equations (12), (13) and (14)
were used in the computation of the error matrics [10, 11].

The predictive model has been able to predict the cost of repairing an underground fiber
cable cut with a high accuracy rate. The MAE value obtained, as indicated in Table 9 shows
an accurate prediction as this paper sort to achieve. We achieved the best value of 0.0658
for MAE performance matric. The obtained MAE value show that our model has high
accuracy in predicting the cost of repairing underground fiber cables. The result attained
is extremely significant in the telecommunication industry, which experiences frequent
underground fiber cable cut to determine the cost of repairing the cable as quickly as pos-
sible. The telecommunication company will be able to allocate the exact predicted cost of
repair for the maintenance of the cable. Using a machine learning model for such industrial
practice offers significant relief of unknow budget and unreliable overhead cost, which may
stifle the MNOs Opex.

The correlation coefficient (CC) indicates the strength of the relationship between the
actual cost of repairing fiber cable and the predicted cost of repairing a fiber cable.

Additionally, the accuracy rate obtained from the result was perfect for the predic-
tive model. The two main evaluation metrics used to measure the accuracy of the pre-
diction were the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root means squared error (RMSE).
According to [10] and [11], lower values of MAE and RMSE are better. This assertion
strongly supports the results of the model deployed in this paper which gave the value
of the correlation coefficient as 0.5179, indicating that the features of the dataset used
the prediction were highly correlated. The performance matric deployed met the empiri-
cal threshold of measurement, and that makes our result more relevant to predict the
expected cost when hard failures occur in underground optical network infrastructure.

Conclusion

The main aim of this paper was to investigate the cost of repairing underground fiber
cable failures, classify the cause of faults, and then used the ML model to predict the
cost of repairing future faults. We achieved this carefully collecting dataset and then
deployed the Weka ML simulation tool to achieve our objectives. The result of the pre-
dictive model is significant to the telecommunications industry, which means the cost of
repairing an underground optical network will be known to the industry players before
the fault occurs. Depending on which area, the cause of the failure and the MTTR, the
predictive model, tells the mobile network operators the cost involved to repair the dam-
aged cable.

Road construction, private developers, water pipes installation, railway construction,
etc. are some of the reasons for underground fiber cable cuts as indicated in the data-
set used for predictive modelling. The K-means clustering model was able to provide
balanced clustering with accurate centroid computation. The multilayer perceptron
FFNN was analyzed and evaluated with the best MAE value, which made the result of
this paper have good, acceptable accuracy in predicting the cost of repairing fiber cable
cuts. The accuracy of this work shows the MNOs will now have an idea about the cost of
repairing the cut in an underground optical cable before it happens. The cost of repairs
depend on the features used for prediction, thus, the region and the cause of the cut.

There has been series and rampant fiber cable cuts in Ghana, parts of Africa and other
low-income countries. The obtained MAE value show that our model has high accu-
racy in predicting the cost of repairing underground fiber cables. The result attained is
extremely significant in the telecommunication industry, which experiences frequent
underground fiber cable cut to determine the cost of repairing the cable as quickly as
possible. The telecommunication company will be able to allocate the exact predicted
cost of repair for the maintenance of the cable. Using a machine learning model for such
industrial practice offers significant relief of unknow budget and unreliable overhead
cost, which may stifle the MNOs Opex.
