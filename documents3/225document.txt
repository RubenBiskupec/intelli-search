implication function and a negation. Until now, in this scenario the conjunction has been
commonly modeled by a t-norm, but recently the possibility of using a more general
conjunction has been pointed out. In this work, we want to generalize the Modus Tollens
inequality by using a conjunctive uninorm instead of a t-norm, leading to the so-called

Nees: ens U-Modus Tollens. First, we give a study of this new property for implication functions in
Uninorm general and then we specially focus on residual implications derived from uninorms. In all
Implication function cases, we prove that there are a lot of solutions of the U-Modus Tollens and we give a
RU-implication characterization of all the solutions in some particular cases.

1. Introduction

Implication functions are commonly used not only to model fuzzy conditionals, but also to carry out all inference pro-
cesses in any fuzzy rule based system. Thus, the importance of implication functions mainly lies in their applications, which
cover a wide range of different fields, in particular, all those where fuzzy control and approximate reasoning can be ap-
plied (see for instance [3,5,18]). This is also the main reason for which it is important to have a wide range of implication
functions to be used in different contexts (see [29]).

From the theoretical point of view, one of the main interesting topics on implication functions is the study and the char-
acterization of those implications that satisfy certain additional properties that usually arise from the concrete applications.
There are many of these properties, but we can highlight among them those derived from the basic inference rules: Modus
Ponens and Modus Tollens (see [9,10,12]). In the framework of fuzzy logic, these inference rules are guaranteed when the
involved logical operators satisfy the following functional inequalities, respectively:

T(x, 1(X,y))<y forall x,y €[0, 1], (1)

and

T(N(y), I(x, y)) < N(x) forall x, y €[0, 1], (2)

where T is a t-norm, / is an implication function and N is a negation.

When implication functions have to be used in managing inference processes, one of these two properties or both of
them are essential. Thus, due to their significance, both inequalities have been largely studied in the literature for many
authors (see for instance [2,3,16,18,26-28,30]). First studies were carried out for implication functions derived from t-norms
and t-conorms. Specifically, residuated implication functions and (S, N)-implications were studied in [2,26,27], whereas the
case of QL and D-implications was studied in [28]. As a generalization of these classes of implications, their counterparts
derived from more general kinds of aggregation functions have been introduced, specially those derived from uninorms
like RU-implications and (U, N)-implications (see for instance [1,4,6,17,22-24]). Recently, both the Modus Ponens and the
Modus Tollens have been studied also for these two kinds of implications derived from uninorms, (see [16] and [15],
respectively).

In fact, although uninorms were initially introduced in the framework of aggregation functions (see [8,31]), they have also
been studied and used as logical operators due to the fact that they are always conjunctive (their value in the point (0, 1)
is O) or disjunctive (their value in (0, 1) is 1). In particular, conjunctive uninorms are commonly used as fuzzy conjunctions.
Thus, the idea of substituting the t-norm T by a conjunctive uninorm U in the Modus Ponens and the Modus Tollens
inference rules becomes natural and it turns out to be an interesting line of research. Note that, in the Modus Ponens
case, this idea was already carried out in [19] leading to the so-called U-Modus Ponens (or equivalently U-conditionality).
Initial results in these works prove that the usual implications derived from t-norms and t-conorms, as well as generated
Yager implications, never satisfy U-Modus Ponens, whereas implications derived from uninorms appear to be the most
suitable ones to satisfy it. In this direction, the case of RU-implications has already been solved in [19], and the case of
(U, N)-implications has been recently studied in [20].

On the contrary, a similar study for the case of the Modus Tollens is still missing. In this paper, we want to deal precisely
with this task and we want to study the same generalization of the Modus Tollens. That is, we want to study the property
obtained from Equation (2) by substituting the t-norm T by a conjunctive uninorm U, that we will call the U-Modus
Tollens:

U(N(y), I(x, y)) < N(x) forall x, y € [0, 1], (3)

where U is a conjunctive uninorm, | is an implication function and N is a fuzzy negation. We want to highlight that in
uninorm-based fuzzy logics (see [14]) a proposition P is considered true when its assigned value is greater than or equal to
e (where e denotes the neutral element of uninorm U). In this context, the rule given by Equation (3) could be interpreted
as follows: “If the value of not Q is greater than or equal to e and the value of P — Q is greater than or equal to e, then
the value of not P is also greater than or equal to e”.

This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, Section 2 is devoted to some preliminaries compiling all the
notations and concepts necessary to follow the article. In Section 3 the U-Modus Tollens is introduced and it is analyzed for
general implication functions. Section 4 is devoted to the case of RU-implications derived from the three most usual classes
of conjunctive uninorms: uninorms in U/pin, representable uninorms and idempotent uninorms. Finally, Section 5 includes
some conclusions and some future work proposals.

2. Preliminaries

We recall some concepts that we will use along the paper.

Definition 2.1. ({11]) A function N : [0,1] — [0,1] is said to be a fuzzy negation if it is decreasing with N(O) =1 and
N(O) = 1. A fuzzy negation N is said to be

e Strict when it is strictly decreasing and continuous.
e Strong when it is an involution, i.e., N(N(x)) =x for all x € [0, 1].

Definition 2.2. ([3,7]) A binary operator I : [0,1] x [0, 1] — [0,1] is said to be an implication function, or an implication, if it
satisfies:

(11) I(x, z) > I(y, z) when x < y, for all z € [0, 1].
(12) I(x, y) < I(x, z) when y <z, for all x € [0, 1].
(13) 1(0,0) =1(1, 1) =1 and 1(1, 0) =0.

Note that it follows from the definition, that [(0,x) =1 and I(x,1)=1 for all x e€ [0,1] whereas the symmetrical values
I(x, 0) and I(1,x) are not derived from the definition.

Special interesting properties for implication functions are:

e The neutrality property,
Id, y)=y forall y € [0,1]. (NP)

55
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

e The identity principle,

I(x,x) =1 forallx e€[0, 1]. (IP)

e The contrapositive property with respect to a negation N
I(x, y) = 1(N(y), N(X)) forall x, y € [0, 1]. (CP(N))

Definition 2.3. ([3,7|) Let | be a fuzzy implication function. The function N; given by N;(x) = 1(x,0) for all x € [0,1] is
always a fuzzy negation, which is called the natural negation of I.

Definition 2.4. ([8,31]) A uninorm is a two-place function U : [0, 1]* —> [0, 1] which is associative, commutative, increasing
in each place, and such that there exists some element e € [0, 1], called neutral element, such that U(e, x) =x for all x € [0, 1].

It is clear that uninorms generalize both t-norms and t-conorms, since they are retrieved from uninorms just taking e = 1
and e = 0, respectively. For any other value e €]0, 1[, the operation works as a t-norm in the square [0,e]?, as a t-conorm
in [e, 1]*, and its values are between minimum and maximum in the set of points A(e) given by

A(e) = [0, e[ x Je, 1] U Je, 1] x [0, e[.

We will usually denote a uninorm with neutral element e and underlying t-norm T and t-conorm S, by U = (T,e,S).
Moreover, for a uninorm U, it is always U(1,0) € {0,1} and U is said to be conjunctive when U(1,0) =0, and disjunctive
when U(1,0) = 1.

There are many different kinds of uninorms. The most common ones can be found in [13]. Let us recall here the structure
of the three most-used classes of conjunctive uninorms that will be used along the paper.

Proposition 2.1. ([8,13]) Let U : [0,1]? — [0,1] be a uninorm with neutral element e € ]0, 1[. If U(O, 1) = 0, then the function
x t+ U(x, 1) is continuous except for x = e if and only if U is given by

eT (2, 2) if (x, y) € [0, eF,
U(x, y) = e+ (1—e)S (458, $2) if (x,y) €[e, 11,
min(x, y) if (x, y) € Ae),

where T is a t-norm and S is a t-conorm.

We will denote by Upin the family of these uninorms and by U = (T,e, S) min the uninorm in Upin with neutral element
e and underlying t-norm T and t-conorm S.
Idempotent uninorms were completely characterized for the general case in [25] in the following way.

Proposition 2.2. ([25,13])A binary operator U : [0, 1]* — [0, 1] is an idempotent uninorm with neutral element e € [0, 1] if and only
if there exists a decreasing function g : [0, 1] — [0, 1], symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, with g(e) =e, such that

min(x, y) if y < g(x) or (y = g(x) andx < g’(x)),
U(x, y) = 4 max(x,y) if y > g(x) or (y = g(x) and x > g*(x)),
xory if y = g(x) and x = g*(x),
where g*(x) = g(g(x)), being U commutative in the points (x, y) such that y = g(x) with x = g(x).
Any idempotent uninorm U with neutral element e and associated function g will be denoted by U = (g, e)ide, and the
class of idempotent uninorms will be denoted by Ujge. Obviously, for any of these uninorms the underlying t-norm Ty is

the minimum and the underlying t-conorm Sy is the maximum.
Another well known class of uninorms is the one given by all uninorms that can be represented by unary functions.

Definition 2.5. ([8,13]) A uninorm U with neutral element e € ]0,1[ is said to be representable if there exists a strictly
increasing and continuous function h: [0, 1] ~ [—oce, too] with h(0) = —ox, h(e) =O and h(1) = +00 such that U is given
by

—] .
U(x. y) = ; (hos) +h(y)) if (x,y) €{@, 1), (1,.0)},

0 (or 1) otherwise.

56
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

Function h is called an additive generator of U. Thus it is clear that there are two different representable uninorms with
the same generator h, a conjunctive one (which is then left-continuous) and a disjunctive one (which is right-continuous).
Any representable uninorm U with neutral element e and additive generator h will be denoted by U = (e,h);ep, and the
class of representable uninorms will be denoted by U;ep. Moreover, for any representable uninorm U = (e,h);rep the function

Np(x) =h7!(—h(x)) for all x € [0, 1]

is always a strong negation associated to the uninorm U.
On the other hand, different classes of implications derived from uninorms have also been studied. Among them, only
RU-implications will be used along the paper and for this reason they are recalled here.

Definition 2.6. ((6]) Let U be a uninorm. The residual operation derived from U is the binary operation given by

Ty (xX, y) = sup{z € [0, 1] | U(x, z) < y} (4)
for all x, y € [0, 1].

Proposition 2.3. ([6]) Let U be auninorm and Iy its residual operation. Then Iy is an implication, called RU-implication, if and only
if the following condition holds

U(x,0)=0 forall x<1. (5)

This property includes all conjunctive uninorms but also many disjunctive ones, for instance the classes of representable
and idempotent uninorms with g(0) = 1 (see [6] and [22]). However, when we deal with left-continuous uninorms U, we
clearly have that U satisfies condition (5) if and only if it is conjunctive. There are some properties of RU-implications
derived from uninorm, that can be deduced directly from the definition, or can be proved in the similar way that it was
done for those derived from t-norms. For more details see [6].

3. Modus tollens with respect to uninorms: U-Modus Tollens

As we have already mentioned, the main objective of this work is the study of the generalization of the Modus Tollens
property obtained by changing the t-norm T by a uninorm U, in a similar way as it was done for the Modus Ponens in
[19]. For obvious reasons we will refer to this generalization as the U-Modus Tollens. Thus, let us begin by giving the formal
definition in the framework of fuzzy logic.

Definition 3.1. Let | be a fuzzy implication function, U a uninorm and N a fuzzy negation. It is said that I and N satisfy the
U-Modus Tollens property with respect to U when

U(N(y), I(x, y)) < N(x) forall x, y € [0,1]. (6)

Note that the definition has been given for a uninorm in general and not for a conjunctive one.! This is because this
property on U is directly derived from the definition of U-Modus Tollens as it is proved in the following proposition.

Proposition 3.1. Let I be a fuzzy implication function and N a negation that satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to a uninorm U.
Then the uninorm U must necessarily be conjunctive.

Proof. If | and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U, just take x = 1 and y =O in Equation (6) to obtain
U(N(0), 111, 0)) < N(1), that is, U(1,0)=0. oO

In view of the proposition above, from now on, we will consider only conjunctive uninorms in the U-Modus Tollens prop-
erty. By Definition 3.1, in general, U-Modus Tollens depends on the uninorm U, the fuzzy implication J, and the fuzzy
negation N. Example 3.1 shows that, for any conjunctive uninorm U, if we require U-Modus Tollens to be valid for some
particular negation N, the admissible implications I depend on the choice of N.

Example 3.1. Let us see how the U-Modus Tollens behaves in the cases where the extreme fuzzy negations are involved,
that is, when we consider the smallest and largest fuzzy negations.

1 Recall that a t-norm T is used to model a conjunction in fuzzy logic. Thus, the normal generalization would be to take a conjunctive uninorm.

57
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

i) Let us consider the smallest fuzzy negation N = Np,, given by

1 ifx=0O,

Np (®) = 1 ifx>0

Note that, if we take any conjunctive uninorm U and the negation Np,, any implication function / trivially satisfies
Equation (6) for all y > 0 (because then Np,(y) =0) and also when x = 0 (because then Np, (x) = 1). On the other
hand, when y = 0 and x > 0 Equation (6) holds if and only if

U(N(O), I(x, 0)) =U, Ni(x)) < N(x) =0,

which implies N;(x) = 0 for all x > 0. Thus, we get the following conclusion: “An implication function I satisfies the U-
Modus Tollens with respect to a conjunctive uninorm U and the fuzzy negation Np, if and only if N; = Np,”.
ii) Let us consider now the greatest fuzzy negation N = Np,, given by

1 ifx <1,
Np2(X) = 1 ifx—1

A similar argument shows the following conclusion: “An implication function | fulfills the U-Modus Tollens with respect
to a conjunctive uninorm U and the fuzzy negation Np, if and only if 1(1, y) =0 for all y < 1”.

Similarly to the case of t-norms, when the uninorm U is left-continuous, we can easily derive a general result about U-
Modus Tollens as follows.

Proposition 3.2. Let U be a conjunctive left-continuous uninorm, Iy its residual implication function and N a fuzzy negation. Then,
an implication function I satisfies the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U and N if and only if

I(x, y) <Tu(N(y), N(x)) forall x, y € [0, 1],
Proof. Just recall that when U is left-continuous the residuation property holds (see [6]) and then
U(N(y), I(x, y)) <N(X) => s(x, y) < Iu (N(y), N(X))..

However, the above condition does not hold when U is not left-continuous and moreover, even when it holds, it can
be difficult to check it in many cases. Thus, we want to deeply study the U-Modus Tollens condition to give more spe-
cific results. A first analysis of the U-Modus Tollens allows us to give some general results that we list in the following
proposition.

Proposition 3.3. Let I be a fuzzy implication function and N a negation that satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to a conjunctive
uninorm U. Let e be the neutral element of U, then the following properties are satisfied

1. U(N(y), 11, y)) = 0 for all y € [0, 1].
2. N;(X) < N(x) for all x € [0, 1]. Also, for all x € [0, 1] such that N;(x) > e it must be N(x) = 1.
3. Take an = sup{x € [0, 1] | N(x) > e}. Then
a) [fay =0 then N(x) <e forall x > 0.
b) Ifay > 0 then it must be I(1, y) =O forall y < an.
4. If I satisfies (NP), then ay = 0.
5. If I satisfies (IP) and N is non filling (N(x) < 1 for x > 0), it must be ay =0.

Proof. Let us prove them step by step.

1. This first item is a direct consequence of the U-Modus Tollens property, just taking x = 1 in Equation (6).
2. Consider N;(x) = 1(x, 0), then we have

N(x) = Ue, I(x, 0)) < UC, I(x, 0)) < N(x),

where the last inequality follows by taking y = O in Equation (6).
On the other hand, if N;(x) > e, taking again y =O in Equation (6), we obtain

N(x) = U(N(O), I(x, 0)) = UC, N7(x)) = UC, e) = 1.

3. Let us consider now ay = sup{x € [0, 1] | N(x) > e}.

58
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

a) If ~y =0, we directly derive from the definition of wy that N(x) <e for all x>0.
b) If ay > 0 we get N(y) >e for all y <a@y and consequently,

I, y) =U(e, 10, y)) <U(N(y), 10, y)) < NC) =9,

that is, 11, y) =0 for all y < ay.
4. If ay > 0, we get I(1, y) =O for all y < ay and consequently | does not satisfy (NP).
5. Suppose in this case that I(x,x) = 1 for all x e€ [0,1] and N(x) <1 for x > 0. In this case, suppose again that there is
some x > 0 with N(x) > e. Taking x = y in Expression (6) we will get

N(x) = U(N(X), I(x, X)) = Ue, 1) = 1,

which is a contradiction. Thus, it must be again N(x) <e for all x > 0 and consequently, ay =0. O

Remark 3.1. Some interesting consequences can be derived from Proposition 3.3 as follows.

(i) If we want to deal with continuous fuzzy negations in the U-Modus Ponens, then we will have ay > 0. From Item 4 in
Proposition 3.3 we get that any possible solution of the U-Modus Ponens fails to satisfy (NP). Consequently, all usual
implications derived from t-norms and t-conorms (that is, R, (S, N), QL and D-implications), as well as Yager generated
implications, never satisfy U-Modus Tollens (since all of them satisfy (NP)). Fortunately, we will see in next sections
that many solutions can be found among those implications derived from uninorms, especially among RU-implications.

(ii) On the other hand, if we want to consider implication functions satisfying (NP), the same argument leads to the
necessity of considering negations with ay) =0, that is, negations N such that N(x) <e for all x > 0 and consequently,
non-continuous.

In the rest of this section we will deal with the case wy = 0 and also when the involved implications satisfy (NP). We
will characterize in particular all solutions in the case when the negation N is strictly decreasing in the interval ]0, e[ and
U is a uninorm in Upin. We start by proving that for this kind of uninorms, U-Modus Tollens always holds for all x < y and
so it is sufficient to prove it for (x, y) such that y <x.

Proposition 3.4. Let I be an implication function, N a fuzzy negation with ay = 0, and U a uninorm in U pin with neutral element
e €]0, 1[. Then I, N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U if and only if

U(N(y), I(x, y)) < N(x) forall y <x.

Proof. We only need to prove that the U-Modus Tollens is always satisfied in points where x < y. Since it is obvious when
x = 0, we deal with values 0 < x < y. In this case we have N(y) < N(x) and since ay =O, it is N(x) <e for all x > 0. Then
we have two Cases:

a) If I(x, y) >e, then

U(N(y), I(x, y)) < U(N(a), I(x, y)) = min{N(a), I(x, y)} = N(X).
b) If I(x, y) <e, then

N(x) I(x, N

We now study the case in which the implication | satisfies (NP), which is the case of most of the implications derived
from t-norms and t-conorms.

Proposition 3.5. Let I be an implication function that satisfies (NP), N a fuzzy negation, and U a conjunctive uninorm with neutral
element e €]0, 1[. If I, N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U, then:

1. U(N(y), y) =0 forall y € [0, 1].
2. N(x) = 0 for all x > e and N(x) <e forall x > 0.

3. U(N(y), I(e, y)) = 0 forall y € [0, 1].
4. If N is strictly decreasing in the interval ]0, e[, then I(x, y) <e forall y <x <e.

Proof. Let us prove all items one by one.
1. U(N(y), y) =0 for all y € [0, 1] follows directly by taking x = 1 in Equation (6) since I satisfies (NP).

59
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

2. According to Proposition 3.3 we know that if I satisfies (NP), then wy =O and N(x) <e for all x > 0. Moreover, just by
putting y =e in the previous condition, we obtain N(e) = U(N(e),e) =O and consequently, N(x) = O for all x > e, by
decreasingness.

3. Now, taking x =e in Equation (6) we get U(N(y), I(e, y)) < N(e) =0, and so U(N(y), I(e, y)) =O for all y € [0, 1].

4. To prove this item let us consider some x, y such that y < x <e and suppose that I(x, y) > e. First, note that y > 0
because I(x, 0) = N;(x) < N(x) <e. Consequently, we have N(y) <e and so, since N is strictly decreasing in ]0, e[,

U(N(y), I(x, y)) = min{N(y), I(x, y)} =N(y) > N(x),

leading to a contradiction. Thus, we obtain I(x, y) <e for all y<x<e. O

When N is a negation strictly decreasing in the interval ]0, e[ and the implication | satisfies (NP), we can give a charac-
terization of those uninorms in U/pip that satisfy the U-Modus Tollens, as follows.

Theorem 3.1. Let I be an implication function that satisfies (NP), U = (Ty, e, Sy) min @ uninorm in Upin with neutral element e €
]O, 1[, and N a fuzzy negation strictly decreasing in ]0, e[. Then I, N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U if and only if the
following properties hold:

1. U(N(y), I(e, y)) = 0 forall y € [0, 1].

2. N(x) = 0 for all x > e and N(x) <e forall x > 0.

3. I(x, y) <e forall y <x <e.

4. I’ and N’ verify the Modus Tollens with respect to Ty for all y < x, where I’ and N’ are given by

1 ifx<y,
I'(x, y) = | I(ex,ey) if y <x (7)
— .
1 ifx=0
N’ (x) = { (8)
(ex) .
= otherwise.

Proof. Let us suppose first that J and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U. Properties 1, 2 and 3 hold from
Proposition 3.5 and thus, we only need to prove that I’ and N’ satisfy the Modus Tollens with respect to Ty for all y <x.
We will distinguish two cases:

e If y=O then,

 

 

Ty(N'(y), I(x, 0) = Ty (1 rex, ~) - — ”) _ — < — =N'(,

where the last inequality is due to Proposition 3.3.
e If y>0, we have

 

Ney) oe) _ UIN(ey), Hex, ey) NCX) _ ney)
— e ?

Ty (N'(y), I(x, y)) =Tu ( :
e e e
where the last inequality holds because I, N satisfy U-Modus Tollens with respect to U.

Conversely, suppose that conditions 1-4 hold and we will prove that I, N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U.
According to Proposition 3.4 the U-Modus Tollens needs to be checked only in points (x, y) where y < x. Thus, we will
consider three cases:

e If y=O, then

U(N(y), I(x, y)) = UC, I(x, 0)) = UC, Ni(x)) = Ni),

where the last equality holds because U € Upin. Then the result follows from Proposition 3.3.
e If 0 < y <x <e then I(x, y) <e and N(y) <e by conditions 3 and 2, respectively. In this case,

U(N(y), I(x, y)) =e-Ty (“. 1M, ”) —e-Ty (' (=) a (=, ~)) <e-N! (=) — N(x),

e e ee

 

where the last inequality holds from condition 4.

e If x>e, then I(x, y) < I(e, y) and hence,

U(N(y), I(x, y)) < U(N(y), Ie, y)) = 9,

where in this case the last equality is due to condition 1. O

Remark 3.2. Let us point out two interesting facts.

i) According to the theorem above, the proof that I,N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to a uninorm U =
(Ty,e, Sy)min in Umin, requires in particular to check that I’ and N’ satisfy the Modus Tollens with respect to Ty.
However, this question was already solved in [26,27] and consequently, our characterization theorem is complete. In
fact, many examples can be derived from conditions in Theorem 3.1 (see Example 3.2 below).

ii) Note that in Theorem 3.1, the t-conorm Sy plays no role in the satisfaction of the U-Modus Tollens and so, Sy can be
any t-conorm. Moreover, the same property holds when the values of the implication I are out of the rectangle [0, e[?,
with the unique condition that it satisfies (NP).

Example 3.2. Let us consider the uninorm in Umin, U = (Tu, e, Su) min Where Ty = Tix is the Lukasiewicz t-norm and Sy is
any t-conorm. Let N, be the negation given by

1 ifx = 0,
Ne(X)=ye—x if0<x<e,
0 ifx>e.

On the other hand, we consider the following fuzzy implication

1 ifx=Oor y = 1,
Te(X, y) = 4 max(e —x,y) if0<x<eandO<y <e,
y otherwise.

It is easy to see that these operators satisfy all the conditions of Theorem 3.1 and therefore I¢, Ne satisfy the U-Modus
Tollens with respect to the uninorm U (Fig. 1).

4. Modus Tollens for RU -implications

In this section, given a conjunctive uninorm U and a fuzzy negation N, we will investigate which RU-implications satisfy
the U-Modus Tollens inequality. We will do it for RU-implications derived from the three classes of uninorms recalled in the
preliminaries. Note that in the previous section we have seen that, for fuzzy negations N with ay > 0 (case that includes all
continuous negations), only implications I such that I(1, y) =0 for all y <a@y can satisfy the U-Modus Tollens. Fortunately,
this condition is satisfied by RU-implications derived from representable uninorms and for some idempotents ones and so,
in these cases we will see that continuous (even strict and strong) negations can be considered.

We will study the U-Modus Tollens for RU-implications derived from uninorms in the class of U/pin, from representable
uninorms and from idempotent uninorms, and we will devote a subsection to each of these cases.

4.1. Case of RU-implications derived from uninorms in Umin
In this subsection, we will deal with RU-implications derived from uninorms in U/pin, that is, uninorms Ug =

(To, €0, So)min With neutral element ep €]0,1[ and underlying t-norm and t-conorm To and So, respectively. Recall that
for this kind of uninorms, RU-implications are given by the following structure.

Proposition 4.1. (Theorem 5.4.7 in [3]) Let U = (Ty, e, Sy) min be a uninorm in Upin and ly its residual implication. Then

1 ifx<y <e,
elty (%, *) ify <x<e,
lu(x,y)= 4 e+ (1 —-eyls, (F2, 5) ife<x<y, (9)
e ife<y <x,
y otherwise.

For this kind of RU-implications we again get that the U-Modus Tollens can be satisfied only with negations N with
ay =0 and consequently, with non-continuous negations. Moreover, for this kind of RU-implications we have the following
result.

Proposition 4.2. Let Iy, be a fuzzy implication derived from Uo = (To, eo, So) min, N a fuzzy negation, and U = (Ty, e, Sy) a con-
junctive uninorm. If Iy,, N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U, then the following properties hold:

. U(N(y), y) =O for all y < eo.

. U(N(y), 1) = N(y) forall y < eo.

ay = 0 (that is, N(x) <e forall x > 0).

. Ife <eo N(x) =O forallx>e.

. [feo <e, Ty is acontinuous t-norm and U (eo, eg) = eo, then N(x) < eo for all x > 0 and N(x) = 0 for all x > eo.

Proof. 1. Follows directly from Equation (6) by putting x = 1 and taking into account that Iy,(1, y) = y for all y < eo.
2. For any x < eg, we have Iy,(x,x) =1 and if we take x = y in Equation (6), we have

U(N(Y), lug (¥, y)) =U(N(y), 1) < N(y).

The result follows from the fact that U(N(y), 1) > N(y) holds always.

3. It is a direct consequence of Proposition 3.3, because it is Iy,(1, y) > 0 for all y > 0.

. If we take y =e in Property 1, we have U(N(e), e) = N(e) =O and by decreasingness, N(x) = 0 for all x > e.

5. First, let us see that N(x) < eg for all 0 <x < eg. Indeed, since Ty is continuous and eg <e is an idempotent element,
if we have that N(x) > eg with eg > x > 0, then

dw

U(e9, xX) =X for all 0<x<e (10)
and then, applying Property 1 we get
0 = U(N(X), x) > U(eo, x) =x

leading to a contradiction. Now, we have that N(x) < eg for all x > 0 by decreasingness, and we only need to prove that
N(e9) =O to conclude the proof. But this is clear because N(e9) < eo and then

0 =U(N(€@o), €o) = N(€o),

where the first equality is due to Property 1 and the second is due to Equation (10). O

In order to characterize the solutions in this case, we will distinguish three different possibilities according to the order
of the neutral elements e and eg. We begin by the most simple case when both elements coincide.

Theorem 4.1. Let Iy, be the RU-implication derived from Uo = (To, €0, So) min, N a fuzzy negation, and U = (Ty, e, Sy) a conjunc-
tive uninorm with neutral element e = eg. Then Iy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U, if and only if the following
properties hold

1. U(N(y), y) =0 forall y < e, and U(N(y), 1) = N(y) forall y <e.

2. N(x) <e forall x > 0, and N(x) = 0 for all x > e.

3. I, and N’ satisfy the Modus Tollens with respect to the t-norm Ty for all y < x, where I, is the residual implication derived from
the t-norm To and N’ is given by Equation (8).

62
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

Proof. Let us suppose that Iy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U. Then the first two items are a direct
consequence of Proposition 4.2, whereas for the third one the same proof as in Theorem 3.1 works, taking into account that
in our case, I7, just coincides with I’ given in Equation (7).

Conversely, suppose that conditions 1-3 are satisfied. We will prove the U-Modus Tollens in some steps.

i) If y>e, we have N(y) =O and so the U-Modus Tollens holds.
ii) Let us suppose that y <e and x< y. In this case Iy,(x, y) =1, and

U(N(y), Lug (x ¥)) = U(N(y), 1) = N(y) S NQ).

iii) Let us suppose that y <e and y <x. We distinguish two subcases:
— When x > e, we get

U(N(y), Lug (x; Y)) = U(N(y), y) =O < NQ®).

— When x <e, we have

Uta 9) = (ew (2) en (.2)) mere (W/(2) tr).

Now, if we apply Property 3, we obtain

,(%
U(N(y), Tug(%. y) SeN’ (5) =N@). co

Remark 4.1. Note that Condition 1 in the previous theorem is quite natural. For instance, when the underlying t-norm Ty
is continuous, the first part of Condition 1 just says that Ty must be a non-strict Archimedean t-norm with associated
negation Nz, > N’. Note that the second part of Condition 1 is always guaranteed when U is a uninorm in U{pin. Moreover,
if N takes all values in ]O,e[, then Condition 1 holds only if U is a uninorm in Upin.

On the other hand, note also that again the underlying t-conorms Sp and Sy play no role in the satisfaction of the
U-Modus Tollens.

In the other two cases, e < €g and eg < e, we need to suppose that some of the underlying operators are given by an
ordinal sum, as follows.

Theorem 4.2. Let Iy, be the RU-implication derived from Uo = (To, €o, So) min, N a fuzzy negation and U = (Ty, e, Su) a conjunctive
uninorm with neutral element e with e < eg. Suppose that Ug is given by

 

 

 

eT, (2, 2) ifx, y € [0, e],
e+ (eo — e) TY (255, y<) ifx, y € [e, eo],
Uo(x, y) = ne (11)
eo + (1 —e9)So (722, = ifx, y €[eo, 1],
min(x, y) otherwise,

where Tj, TG are t-norms. Then Iy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U if and only if the following properties hold

1. U(N(y), y) =0 forall y < e and U(N(y), 1) = N(y) forall y <e.

2. N(x) <e forall x > 0 and N(x) = 0 forall x > e.

3. | Ti, and N’ satisfy the Modus Tollens with respect to the t-norm Ty forall y < x, where I T is the residual implication derived from
the t-norm T¢ and N’ is given by Equation (8).

Proof. According to Equation (11) we have Ug(e,e) =e and for all y <x <e we get

x y
Tuy (x, y) = ely, (5. )

and the result follows similarly to the proof of Theorem 4.1. O

Remark 4.2. Note that the structure of Uo required in Equation (11) is not restrictive at all. In fact, since Up is in Upin, When
To is continuous then Ug is given by Equation (11) if and only if e is an idempotent element of Uo, that is, Ug(e,e) =e
(and the corresponding t-norms Tg and T¢ are also continuous).

63
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

Theorem 4.3. Let Iy, be the RU-implication derived from Uo = (To, €o, So) min, N a fuzzy negation, and U = (Ty, e, Sy) a conjunc-
tive uninorm with neutral element e with eg < e. Suppose that the restriction of U to the square [0, e]? is given by

eoTy (x. x) ifx, y €[0, eo],
U(x, Y)= jeg t+ (e—e0)Ty (22 y=20 ) if x, y € [eo, el, (12)

e—eg’ e—€o

 

 

min(x, y) otherwise,

where T;,, T; are t-norms. Then Iy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U if and only if the following properties hold

1. U(N(y), y) =0 forall y < eg and U(N(y), 1) = N(y) forall y < eo.

2. N(X) < €g for all x > 0 and N(x) = 0 for all x > eg.

3. It, and N’ satisfy the Modus Tollens with respect to the t-norm T,, for all y < x, where Ir, is the residual implication derived from
the t-norm To and N’ is given by

1 ifx=0,

N’(x) = 13
%) a otherwise. (13)

Proof. In this case, Item 2 is guaranteed by Item 5 in Proposition 4.2, whereas the rest of the proof is similar to the
theorems above. O

Remark 4.3. Note that the requirement that the restriction of U to the square [0, e]* is given by Equation (12) is equivalent
to be eg an idempotent element of U whenever the corresponding underlying t-norm Ty is continuous.

Example 4.1. Let us consider the uninorm in Upin given by Up = (To, eo, So) min and the uninorm U defined by Theorem 4.3,
where To = Ty = Ty is the Lukasiewicz t-norm and So, Sy are any t-conorms. Let N be the negation given by

1 ifx = 0,
N(xX)=4e@o9—-X if0<x <p,
0 ifx>e.

It is easy to see that these operators satisfy all the conditions of Theorem 4.3 and therefore Iy,,N satisfy the U-Modus
Tollens with respect to U.

4.2. Case of RU-implications derived from representable uninorms

In this section, we will consider the case of RU-implication obtained from representable uninorms, that is, from uni-
norms Uo = (h, eo)rep whose expression is given in Definition 2.5. Let us recall in this case the expression of the residual
implication derived from Uo.

Proposition 4.3. (Theorem 5.4.10 in [3]) Let Up = (h, eo) rep be a representable uninorm with neutral element eo €]0, 1[. Then Iy,
is given by

_jl if (x, y) € {(0, 0), (1, 1},
lUg (X,Y) = h-'(h(y) —h(x)) otherwise. (14)

In this section we will see that, contrariously to what happens in all the previous cases, in this one there are solutions
of the U-Modus Tollens involving continuous (even strong) negations. In fact, we will characterize all solutions in the
case when the negation is the proper strong negation associated to the representable uninorm. That is, given the uninorm
Uo = (h, eo) rep, the negation N is given by

N(x) = Np(x) =h7!(—h(x)) forall =x € [0,1].

Theorem 4.4. Let Up = (h, eo) rep be a representable uninorm, Iy, its residual implication, and Np its associated negation. Let U
be a left-continuous conjunctive uninorm with neutral element e and Iy its residual implication. Then, the following conditions are
equivalent:

1) Iy, and Np, satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U.
2) Tuy (x, Y) < Tu(Na(y), Nn(x)) for all x, y € [0, 1].
3) U(x, y) < Uo(x, y) for all x, y € [0, 1].

64
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

Proof. Equivalence between (1) and (2) follows directly from the general result given in Proposition 3.2. So, we only need
to prove the equivalence between (2) and (3). However, it is well known (see Proposition 5.4.13 in [3]) that Iy, satisfies
contrapositive symmetry with respect to Np, that is,

Tug (XY) =1ug(Nn(y), Nn(X)) for all x, y € [0, 1].

Thus, taking into account that Np is a strong negation, and therefore a bijective function, we get that (2) is equivalent to

Tug (X,Y) <Tu(x, y) for all x, y € [0, 1].

Finally, the equivalence between this last inequality and (3) follows from the fact that, for RU-implications derived from
left-continuous uninorms, it holds

Ty (x, y) = sup{z € [0,1] | U(x,z)< yy} and U(x, y) =inf{z € [0,1] | Iy(x,z)>y}. oO

Example 4.2. Let Up = (h, e)rep be a representable uninorm with neutral element e €]O, 1[. We know that the underlying
t-norm Ty, and t-conorm Sy, are strict. Let us consider U, U’ €Upin given by

U = (Tuo, &s Sup) min and U'= (min, @, Sug) min.

It is obvious that U < Ug but U’ L£ Up and then, according to Theorem 4.4, we obtain that Iy,, Np satisfy U-Modus Tollens
with respect to U but not with respect to U’.

4.3. Case of RU-implications derived from idempotent uninorms

In this section, we will deal with RU-implications derived from idempotents uninorms, that is, from uninorms Up =
(2, €o)ide With neutral element eg € [0, 1] and such that g(0) = 1. We will see that in this case solutions involving continuous
negations are again available. Let us recall in this case the expression of the residual implication derived from Uo.

Proposition 4.4. (Theorem 5.4.14 in [3]) Let Up = (8, €0)ide be an idempotent uninorm with neutral element eo €]0, 1[ and such
that g(0) = 1. Then Iy, is given by

max(g(x),y) ifx<y,

min(g(x),y) ifx>y. (15)

Tug (X, y) =

In the particular case of left-continuous idempotent uninorms with associated function g given by a strong negation, it
is possible to obtain a similar result to the one obtained in the case of representable uninorms (see Theorem 4.4) with a
very similar proof.

Theorem 4.5. Let No be a strong fuzzy negation with fixed point eo. Let Up = (No, €0) ide be a left-continuous idempotent uninorm
with neutral element eo €]O, 1[ and Iy, its residual fuzzy implication. Let U be a left-continuous conjunctive uninorm with neutral
element e and Iy its residual implication. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

1) Iy, satisfies U-Modus Tollens with respect to U and No.

2) Tuo (x, y) < Tu(No(y), No(X)) for all x, y € [0, 1].
3) U(x, y) < Uo(X, y) for all x, y € [0, 1].

In the general case when g is simply a decreasing function symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, we will
distinguish two cases depending on whether g(1) =O or not. First, we deal with the case g(1) =O and we give only a
partial result when both, the neutral element of U and the neutral element of Uo, coincide with the fixed point of the
negation N.

Theorem 4.6. Let Up = (g, €0)ide be an idempotent uninorm with neutral element eg €]O, 1[ such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) =O. Let N
be a fuzzy negation with fixed point en = eg and let U be a uninorm with neutral element e = eg. Then Iy, and N satisfy U-Modus
Tollens with respect to U if and only if the following properties hold:

1. g(x) < N(x) for all x € [0, 1].

2. U(N(X), £(X)) = N(x) for all x < eo.

3. U(N(X), X) = N(x) for all x > eg.

4. U(N(y), y) < N(x) forall y < g(x) <eo <x.

65
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

Proof. Let us suppose first that Iy, and N satisfy U-Modus Tollens with respect to U and let us prove conditions 1-4 step
by step.

1. If we take y =eo in Equation (6) we obtain

U(N(e0), Lug (X, €o)) = Uo, £(X)) = B(x) < N(x)

for all x € [0,1].
2. Putting in this case x = y in Equation (6) and taking into account that x < eo, we have

U(N(X), Tuy (X, X)) = U(N(X), 8(X)) < N(x).
However, since x < eo, we have that both N(x), g(x) > eo and then
U(N(x), 8(x)) => max(N(X), 8(x)) = N(Q),

and hence we obtain the equality.
3. Similarly as above, taking x = y in Equation (6) we obtain in this case

U (N(x), Lug (X, X)) = U(N(X), X) < N(X).

Now, since x > €g we have U(N(x), xX) > U(N(X), eg) = N(x) and we derive again the equality.
4. Finally, suppose that y < g(x) < eg <x. Then it is y < g(x) < eg < g(y) and then we obtain by the U-Modus Tollens that

U(N(Y), Lug (x; ¥)) = U(N(y), y) < N(x).

Conversely, suppose that conditions 1-4 hold and let us prove the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U by distinguishing
some cases:

(1) When x < y < g(x). In this case we have N(y) < N(x) and x < eg and then

U(N(Y), Tuy (x, Y)) = U(N(Y), 8(X)) < U(N(X), 8(X)) = NQ),
where last equality follows by Condition 2.
(ii) When x, g(x) < y. Similarly, in this case N(y) < N(x), y > eo and then
U(N(Y), lug, y)) =U(N(Y), y) = N(y) < NQ),

where the last equality is due to Condition 3.
(iii) When g(x) < y <x. In this case it must be eg <x and also g(x) < N(x) < eo and N(y) < N(g(x)). Consequently, we
obtain

U(N(y), lug (X, Y)) = U(N(y), 8(x)) < U(N(8(%)), 8(X)) < N(X),

where the last inequality follows by Condition 4.
(iv) When x, g(x) > y. In this last case we have y < e€g < N(y) and then we can consider two possibilities:
e If x <eg then N(x) > eg and considering Condition 4 with x = eg we derive U(N(y), y) < eo, from which we deduce

U(N(y), ug (x, ¥)) = U(N(y), y) S eo S N(X).

e If x> eo then N(x) < eg and again from Condition 4 we have
U(N(Y), lug, y)) =U(N(Y), y) SN). O

Note that there are a lot of uninorms U and negations N satisfying all conditions given in the previous theorem. As a
mater of example let us describe two particular cases in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.7. Let Up = (2, €0)ide be an idempotent uninorm with neutral element eg €]0, 1[ such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) =O. Let N
be a fuzzy negation with fixed point en = eg and let U be a uninorm with neutral element e = eo. Then the following properties hold:

1. IfU = (Ty, eo, Su) min is a uninorm in Umin with underlying t-conorm Sy = max, then Iy, and N satisfy U-Modus Tollens with
respect to U if and only if g(x) < N(x) forall x € [0, 1].

2. If N is strong and U = (N, €0)ide is the corresponding left-continuous idempotent uninorm with associated function N, then Iy,
and N satisfy U-Modus Tollens with respect to U if and only if g(x) < N(x) for all x € [0, 1].

66
I, Aguil6, J.V. Riera, J. Sufier et al. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 127 (2020) 54-69

Proof. We only need to prove that in both cases the remaining Conditions 2-4 in Theorem 4.6 always hold.

1. If U = (Ty, eo, Su) min Conditions 3-4 follow directly, whereas Condition 2 is also guaranteed when Sy = max.
2. If N is strong and U = (N, éo)ide is left-continuous it holds U(N(x), x) = min(N(x),x) ensuring conditions 3-4. On the
other hand, when x < eg we have g(x), N(x) > eg and then

U (N(x), g(x)) = max(N(X), g(x)) = N(x),

ensuring Condition 2. O

Let us deal now with the case of RU-implications built from idempotent uninorms Up = (g, eo) ide With neutral element
€g €]O, 1[ and such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) > 0. We will split our reasoning into two cases depending on whether g(1) >e
or not. Note that in any case it must be g(1) < e9 = g(e€g) because g is decreasing.

Theorem 4.8. Let Up = (g, €0)ide be an idempotent uninorm with neutral element eg €]0, 1[ such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) =a > 0.
Let N be a fuzzy negation and U a uninorm with neutral element e with e < a < eg. Then Iy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with
respect to U if and only if the following properties hold:

1. U(N(y), y) =0 forall y <e.
2. N(x) <e forall x > 0 and N(x) = 0 forall x > e.
3. U(N(X), 1) = N(X) for all x < e.

Proof. Let us suppose first that Iy, and N satisfy U-Modus Tollens with respect to U.

1. Since Iy,(1, y) = y for all y < g(1) =q@ and e <q, taking x = 1 in Equation (6) we obtain

U(N(y), luj(, y)) = U(N(y), y) Ss NC) = 0

and then U(N(y), y) =O for all y <e.

2. Taking x =e <q in the previous step, we have U(N(e),e) = N(e) =O and so N(x) = O for all x >e because N is
a decreasing function. Moreover, the fact that N(x) <e for all x > 0 follows directly from Proposition 3.3 because
Iu,(, y) £0 for all y > 0.

3. Since a < eo, taking x = y <a in Equation (6) (by symmetry with respect to the main diagonal it must be g(x) = 1 for
all x <a. Thus, Iy, = (x, X) = max(g(x), x) = 1), we obtain:

U (N(x), Lug (X, X)) = U(N(X), 1) < N(x).

Taking into account that U(N(x), 1) > N(x) holds for any uninorm U, we derive the equality for all x<e<a.
Conversely, suppose that conditions 1-3 hold and we will split the proof in some cases.

(1) When y > e we have N(y) =0 and the U-Modus Tollens follows because U is conjunctive.
(ii) When y <e <q, in this case, we distinguish two cases:

e Ifx<y then U(N(Y), lug (x, y)) = U(N(y), 1) = N(y) < N(X).

e If y <x then U(N(y), lug (x, y)) =U(N(y), y) =O < N(x). O

Remark 4.4. Again there are a lot of uninorms U and negations N satisfying all conditions in the theorem above as we can
see in next example. Just note that,

e Condition 1 only affects the underlying t-norm Ty. In particular, the zero region of Ty must contain all points (N(y), y)
with y <e. For instance, when Ty is continuous this implies that Ty must be a non-strict Archimedean t-norm with
associated negation Ny, such that Nr, (y) > Mey) for all y € [0, 1].

e Condition 3 in Theorem 4.8 holds for instance whenever U is a uninorm in Upin.

Example 4.3. Let Up = (g,e€o)ide be an idempotent uninorm with neutral element ep €]0,1[ such that g(0) =1 and
g(1) =a > 0. Take some e <q and consider the uninorm U = (Tjx, e, Sy) min and the negation Ne defined in Example 3.2.
According to the previous remark, U and Ne verify all conditions in Theorem 4.8 and so, Iy, and Ne satisfy the U-Modus
Tollens with respect to U.

Finally, we deal with the case 0 < g(1) =a@ <e. In this framework we will reduce our study to the case when e = €o.
Even with this restriction, the characterization in that case becomes subjected to five conditions as we prove in the following
result.

Theorem 4.9. Let Up = (g, €0)ide be an idempotent uninorm with neutral element eg €]0, 1[ such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) =a > 0.
Let N be a fuzzy negation and U a uninorm with neutral element e = eo. Then Iy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to
U if and only if the following properties hold:

. U(N(y), y) =O forall y <a.

. N(X) < eo for all x > 0.

. U(N(X), £(X)) = N(x) for all x < eo.

. U(N(Y), &(X)) < N(x) forall a < g(x) <y <x.

. U(N(y), y) < N(X) for all x, g(x) < y, and also forall y <xanda@ < y < g(x) <eg9 <x.

On BR WH =

Proof. Let us suppose that Jy, and N satisfy the U-Modus Tollens with respect to U and we prove the items one by one.

1. This item follows similarly as in the previous theorem just taking x = 1 in Equation (6).
2. This item follows directly from Proposition 3.3 because Iy,(1, y) £0 for all y > 0.
3. Note first of all that taking x = y in Equation (6) we have

U(N(X), Tug (x, X)) = U(N(x), £(X)) < N(x) forall x € [0, 1]. (16)
However, if we consider x < €g we have g(x) > eg and then it is also
U(N(X), §(x)) = U(N(X), eo) = N(x),

and hence the item follows.
4. If a < g(x) < y <x we have again by Equation (6) that

U(N(y), Lug (x, Y)) = U(N(y), &(X)) < NQ).
5. If x, g(x) < y by Equation (6) we obtain
U(N(Y), Tug (%, y)) = U(N(Y), y) < N().
If y<xanda<y< g(x) <e <x then U(N(y), Iu, (x, y)) =U(N(y), y) < NCQ).

Conversely, suppose that properties 1-5 are fulfilled and we will prove that Iy, and N satisfy U-Modus Tollens with
respect to U by considering some cases.

(1) When x < y < g(x), we have N(y) < N(x) and x < eg. Then

U(N(Y), Lug (X, Y)) = U(N(Y), 8(x)) < U(N(X), 8(X)) = NX)
where last equality follows by Property 3.
(ii) When x, g(x) < y, applying Property 5 we have
U(N(y), lu, (x, y)) = U(N(y), y) < NQ).

(iii) When @ < g(x) < y <x, we have

U(N(y), Lug (Xs ¥)) = U(N(y), 8(x)) < N(x)

according to Property 4.

(iv) When x, g(x) > y, we have U(N(y), Iu, (x, y)) = U(N(y), y) and then we can consider two cases:
e If y <a then by Property 1 we have U(N(y), y) =0 < N(a).
e If y>qa then U(N(y), y) < N(x) according to Property 5. O

5. Conclusions and future work

Modus Tollens is an inference rule which becomes essential when backward reasoning is applied. When Modus Tollens
is want to be applied in fuzzy control and approximate reasoning, the fuzzy logical operators used in this framework must
Satisfy the inequality

T(N(y), I(x, y)) < N(x) forall x,y € [0,1],

where T is a t-norm, / is an implication function and N is a negation. Due to its importance, the previous equation has
been extensively investigated and even some generalizations have appeared.

In this paper we have generalized this inequality by substituting the t-norm T by a conjunctive uninorm U, leading
to the U-Modus Tollens. This new property has been exhaustively studied in many situations and, specially, in the case
when I satisfies (NP), which is the case of the most usual implications. Moreover, a special attention has been paid to the
case of RU-implications, that is, residuated implications derived from uninorms. A lot of solutions have been characterized
when RU-implications are derived from uninorms in U/pin, from representable uninorms, and from idempotent uninorms,
including many examples.

As a future work, this study can be extended to RU-implications derived from other kinds of uninorms, like compen-
satory uninorm or uninorms continuous in the open unit square. Also other types of implications can be considered as
(U, N)-implications (see [4]), or h-implications and (h, e)-implications (see [21]).
