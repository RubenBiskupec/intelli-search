ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Keywords: A fully open-source available framework for the parametric cross-sectional analysis and design optimization of
SONATA slender composite structures, such as helicopter or wind turbine blades, is presented. The framework—

VABS Structural Optimization and Aeroelastic Analysis GQONATA)—incorporates two structural solvers, the commer-

ANBA4 cial tool VABS, and the novel open-source code ANBA4. SONATA also parameterizes the design inputs, post-

tools. It is linked to the optimization library OpenMDAO. This work presents the methodology and explains
the fundamental approaches of SONATA. Structural characteristics were successfully verified for both VABS
and ANBA4 using box beam examples from literature, thereby verifying the parametric approach to generating
the topology and mesh in a cross section as well as the solver integration. The framework was furthermore
exercised by analyzing and evaluating a fully resolved highly flexible wind turbine blade. Computed structural
characteristics correlated between VABS and ANBA4, including off-diagonal terms. Stresses, strains, and defor-
mations were recovered from loads derived through coupling with aeroelastic analysis. The framework, there-
fore, proves effective in accurately analyzing and optimizing slender composite structures on a high-fidelity
level that is close to a three-dimensional finite element model.

 

1. Introduction

Modern rotor blades have complex architectures that are defined
by a vast number of design parameters. Investigating their constraints
and design drivers requires incorporating multidisciplinary perspec-
tives, including the structural dynamics, aerodynamics, materials
sciences, and manufacturability restrictions. Therefore, designing
blades for either rotorcraft or wind turbine application can be time
consuming and expensive. A design approach that combines the struc-
tural dynamics and aerodynamics simultaneously rather than itera-
tively offers a more systematic development process that results in
better blades [1]. Hence, effects from aeroelasticity should be consid-
ered in the earliest stages of the design process [2].

State-of-the-art aeroelastic analysis tools, such as CAMRAD II [3],
Dymore [4], MBDyn [5], and BeamDyn [6] in FAST [7,8] model the
blade-structural dynamics with one-dimensional (1D) beam elements.
In comparison to fully resolved three-dimensional (3D) finite element
models, this approach simplifies the mathematical formulation and

increases the computational efficiency [9]. The slender geometrical
characteristics of rotor blades proves the simplification of approximat-
ing them as 1D beams as sufficient [10]. However, using 1D beam ele-
ments decouples the structural characteristics from a_ realistic
composite-blade definition, manufacturability constraints, and blade
structural design parameters. Therefore, occurring issues in the blade
design are often not discovered until later, when changes become
increasingly expensive and time consuming [11]. These issues can
be resolved by keeping a strong connection between the aeroelastic
and internal structural design. Although fully resolved 3D finite-
element models would be the most accurate approach for modeling
modern composite rotor blades, they are often not used until the final
design stages [9,12] because of their complexity and computational
costs. Different ways to approach modeling 1D beams based on 3D
structural designs are required.

In 1983, Giavotto et al. [13] developed a general approach for the
characterization of anisotropic beams. It uses the de Saint—Venant’s
principle to determine the Timoshenko stiffness matrix of a beam cross

section. This approach led to a Fortran code, called either ANBA or
HANBA, that has never officially been released. Giavotto et al.’s formu-
lation was adopted by many research groups who developed their own
version of the code. Among them, NABSA [14] and BECAS [15,16] are
worth mentioning. In 1995, Cesnik and Hodges [17] published the
Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS) tool that uses
the geometrically exact beam theory [18], based on the variational
asymptotic method [19], to accurately determine structural character-
istics of a two-dimensional (2D) cross section. Since that time, VABS
[14,20,21] has evolved and became a popular tool in rotor blade pre-
design and multidisciplinary rotor design optimization. Its modeling
capabilities have been validated in numerous publications [2,22—24].

A slightly different approach was recently proposed by Morandini
and Chierichetti [25]. It led to the Python-based open-source code
for ANisotropic Beam Analysis: ANBA version 4.0 (ANBA4). The main
difference between ANBA4’s approach and both previous ANBA ver-
sions and VABS can be found in the kinematic description of the dis-
placement field and in the slightly different theoretical approach.
Both ANBA and VABS assume that the displacement of an arbitrary
point is given by the sum of a cross section’s rigid rotations and trans-
lations superposed with the warping field. The new approach of
ANBA4 instead gets rid of the unknown and redundant cross-section
movement and uses displacement of the points as the only unknown
of the problem. It is then possible to compute the polynomial solutions
of the elastic problem (the so-called de Saint-Venant’s solutions) by
resorting to the peculiar mathematical structure of the beam problem;
see Section 2.5.2. The same approach was later adopted by different
authors, including the work from Han and Bauchau [26].

While characterizing the blade’s internal structure with common
computer-aided design (CAD) tools is feasible, transferring it to a
meshed cross section is challenging in an automated design analysis
and optimization approach. Therefore, parametric topology and mesh
generators with respective preprocessing and postprocessing, as well
as plotting functionalities [27] and a robust platform for software inte-
gration [28] are needed. Li [29] presented a parametric mesh genera-
tor that, although limited to a fixed number of layers with identical
thickness, could efficiently model and mesh a cross-sectional layout.
Optimizing ply thickness and fiber orientation was conducted using
VABS as the structural solver and DYMORE to determine blade loads.
Ghiringhelli et al. [30] coupled a custom parametric mesh generator
by using an earlier version of ANBA to maximize the active twist
authority of a helicopter blade cross section while accounting for sim-
ple structural and aeroelastic constraints. By using a response surface
method and genetic optimization algorithm, Lim et al. [31] presented
the rotor structural design optimization of a compound rotorcraft by
varying the web positions, number of plies, and fiber orientation.
The approach included multiple constraints such as structural integ-
rity, location of shear center, and discrete ply orientation. VABS was
used as structural solver, and CAMRAD II was used to conduct the
aeromechanical analysis.

Supported by the U.S. Army, Rohl et al. [2,11] presented IXGEN, a
cross-section mesh generator that uses a graphical modeling interface
to define the composite layup of a rotor blade. Cross-sectional features
such as webs, spar caps, and wrapping layers can be used as design
variables during an optimization. The stiffness properties were deter-
mined with VABS and applied to RCAS. IXGEN uses OpenCascade,
an open-source CAD geometry kernel to generate 3D blade geometries
and 2D cross-sectional meshes. The framework was applied to the
aeroelastic analysis and design of an active twist rotor [32,33], result-
ing in a maximization of the actuator authority. Recently, to design
reduced-emission rotorcraft, Silva and Johnson [28] began integrating
IXGEN into RCOTools [34], a Python-based interface between various
rotorcraft analysis tools, such as CAMRAD II, NDARC, and Open-
MDAO. Glaz et al. [35,36] again used VABS, applying a surrogate-
based optimization approach to successfully reduce helicopter blade
vibrations by optimizing the structural design. Wind-energy-related

approaches were mostly derived from the aerospace world, using tools
such as VABS or BECAS. Chen et al. [37] assessed multiple solvers for
cross-sectional analysis of composite wind turbine blades, concluding
that other tools such as PreComp [38], FAROB [39], and CROSTAB
[40] perform in an inferior manner compared to VABS.

This work presents the Structural Optimization and Aeroelastic
Analysis (SONATA) framework to address the continuing need
[31,41,42] for a comprehensive and multidisciplinary structural
design analysis and optimization environment. It includes the determi-
nation of cross-sectional structural properties and stress and strain
recovery, and accounts for design and material constraints. The frame-
work can be applied to design applications for arbitrary slender com-
posite structures, including rotorcraft and wind turbine blades. It
incorporates both VABS as the community-approved tool to solve
structural properties, and ANBA4 as an additional fully open-source
solver. Current focus is on the validation and verification of SONATA
capabilities, and presentation of the analysis methodology, including
the parametric topology and mesh generation of cross sections, deter-
mination of structural characteristics, recovery analysis, and imple-
mented preprocessing and postprocessing functionalities.

In the following, the individual modules and capabilities from
SONATA are described and validated using box beam examples from
literature. The final analysis and evaluation of a fully resolved wind
turbine blade showcases the tool’s applicability to complex applica-
tions, including recovery analysis bases on loads determined through
coupling with aeroelastic analysis. Code-to-code comparison between
VABS and ANBA4 further verifies the structural solver modules.

2. Methodology

SONATA closes the gap between 1D beam finite element models
and the 3D blade design. The 1D finite element model, which is
required for specifying elastic beam models in aeroelastic analysis
tools, is characterized by evaluating multiple 2D cross sections of a
slender composite structure; see Fig. 1. SONATA incorporates a multi-
disciplinary rotor-blade design framework; see Fig. 2. Its automatized
and parametric setup intends to analyze and optimize slender struc-
tures with composite layers being placed in a circumferential uniform
scheme, and therefore, antisymmetric configuration. Such layup con-
figurations are commonly applied to modern rotorcraft and wind tur-
bine blades. SONATA comprises five main components:
parametrization and surface generation, topology generation, mesh
discretization, solving for the structural properties, and evaluating as
well as postprocessing of the results. SONATA is based on Python.
Its cross-sectional beam model (CBM) uses the CAD-Kernel OpenCAS-
CADE with pythonOCC [43].

3D stress and strain recovery can either be performed by applying
user-selected load inputs or determined loads from aeroelastic analy-
sis; see Fig. 2. The latter is especially useful when applied to, and
wrapped in, an OpenMDAO [44] optimization. To date, such wrappers
have been implemented for Dymore [45,46] and CAMRAD II [34] with
application to rotorcraft, and for BeamDyn [6] with application to
wind turbines. Existing OpenMDAO structures can fairly easily be
adapted to feature other aeroelastic analysis codes. The focus of this
work is to present and validate the analysis capabilities; detailed opti-
mization studies will be subject to follow-up publications. The follow-
ing subsections provide an overview on the fundamental SONATA
analysis components, including descriptions of essential conventions
and definitions.

2.1. Coordinate systems
The global coordinate system (see Fig. 3) is called the blade frame

(superscript B). The radial grid of the investigated composite structure
spans along the x}-axis. Directions, x3 and x3, then provide the area of

a cross section at user-defined radial grid locations, or x?-stations,
respectively. The outer shape of a beam or blade is defined as wire-
frames by a collection of airfoils, or other arbitrary outer shapes,
which are projected along the nondimensional x?-axis, translated to

the nondimensional twist-axis location (scaled to chord length),
rotated by the twist angle, ©,,, around x?, scaled to the desired chord
length, and moved onto the beam geometric curve. Because the beam
geometric curve arbitrarily bends and twists, the structural mass and
stiffness properties are determined in respect to the local coordinate
system (superscript L) of the CBM, an independent axes definition that
results in the local CBM curve. The unit vector of x} is tangent to the
local CBM curve, and the unit vectors of x5 and x are in the plane nor-
mal to the local CBM curve, with x5 pointing to the leading edge par-
allel to the chord. This separation allows evaluation of cross-sectional
properties at arbitrary reference locations within a cross section, inde-
pendent from the outer geometry. Assuming the modeling of blade
twist and curvature to be part of an aeroelastic analysis model would
require the local CBM curve to be identical to the beam geometric
curve.

Fig. 4 illustrates the conventions in a 2D cross section. The
twist-reference location is on the beam geometric curve, and the
L-coordinates lie on the local CBM curve; see Fig. 3. Start and end loca-
tions of the elements within the internal structural 2D finite element
model are defined using the counter-clockwise s-coordinates; see
Fig. 4. Its origin is typically located on the trailing edge.

The s-coordinates are nondimensional and range from 0 to 1 along the
outer-boundary curve of the airfoil. They propagate through the seg-
ments and layers with an interval tree structure as sets of consecutive
B-splines. This method allows to efficiently find the intervals of over-
lapping layers and to locate the corresponding start and end locations
of each layer. The material plane defines the orientation of each mesh
element rotated by the ply orientation angle, ©,,, around the x{-axis,
resulting in the ply-coordinate system, P; see Fig. 5. The ply orienta-
tion angle is determined automatically in respect to the set of B-
splines defining each layer. Finally, the P-frame is rotated around
the x5-axis by the given material orientation angle, 3, of an individual
layer, resulting in the material-coordinate system, M.

2.2. Initialization and parametrization

SONATA input files are defined using the YAML syntax. It provides
definitions of the outer shape and orientation in space of the beam or
blade, including the twist, chord, twist-reference location, airfoil defi-
nitions, and required axis locations along the radial grid. Further
inputs are the internal structure of the cross sections, including webs,
segments, and layers at arbitrary radial locations, airfoil outer shapes,

and a database for material properties. The latter can accommodate
isotropic, orthotropic, and anisotropic materials with a respective ref-
erence index for identifications. The material orientation angle is
neglected for layers with an isotropic material, such as for core mate-
rial. Once the beam or blade design is loaded, the data are parameter-
ized according to user-defined radial stations.

2.3. Topology

The method for generating the cross-sectional topology was
inspired from manufacturing processes, where layers are placed on
top of each other in negative molds consecutively from the outside
to the inside. Each layer is described by its thickness, start and end
locations in regard to the s-coordinates (see Fig. 4), a fiber-
orientation angle, and an assigned material. The topology introduces
multiple segments that can each include various numbers of layers.
The first segment includes the layup attached to the outer-boundary
curve of the airfoil. Following segments are ordered subsequently from
the leading to the trailing edge and separated by webs attached to the
innermost layer of the first segment. Webs are defined as an either
straight or curved line between two s-coordinate locations. Fig. 6
shows a generic example of a composite-blade cross section. It demon-
strates the topology capabilities of SONATA and accounts for the most
common topology requirements from rotorcraft or wind turbine
blades, including (from the leading to the trailing edge) shell layers
and a c-spar with filled cavities and an added circular trim mass, a
box beam, spar caps connected by webs, shell fillers, and trailing edge
reinforcements. Each segment can include multiple layers that can be
individually associated with different material properties and optional
core materials.

The boundary curves separating the segments (i.e., the webs) and
each layer within a segment are represented using counterclockwise
sets of consecutive B-splines, with the airfoil outer shape being the
outermost B-spline. Each layer is generated by performing a parallel
offset according to the layer thickness of an existing B-spline and
within its start and end positions, which are defined in s-
coordinates. Child B-splines are connected to the parent B-splines with
added smooth-layer cutoffs at the start and end locations.

2.4. Meshing

Once the cross-sectional topology has been generated, while
respecting the layup definitions, the mesh discretization follows in a
reverse order, from the inside to the outside. Each layer is meshed
by orthogonal projections and corner-style differentiation. Fig. 7
shows the first six cornerstyles that are currently implemented in
SONATA. A layer is described by a set of two B-splines, the inner,
Qp_spliney ANd the outer, bg_sptine. The nodes on each B-spline are called,
accordingly, Qnodes ANd Dpodes. First, existing Gnodes are determined. In
case that nodes are missing on the @g_ spine, additional uniformly placed
nodes are introduced. Then, each node is projected in an orthogonal
manner to the bg_spiine. If multiple projections exist (see Fig. 7), the
number of projections (i.e., potential b,oaes) and the angle, a, between
the range of projections are determined. Next, depending on the pro-

jection angle, a, the defined critical projection angle, a,;,, and the
number of potential exterior corners in between, the specific corner-
style and the meshing procedure are determined. After all the nodes
are placed on a set of B-splines, they are connected to form cells with
associated material properties and fiber-orientation angles. Subse-
quent steps improve the mesh quality by modifying sharp and large
aspect-ratio cells and cell-orientation angles. Once every layer in a seg-
ment has been meshed, remaining cavities are triangulated using the
Shewchuk [47] algorithm with an area constraint. Hanging nodes
between two neighboring segments are avoided by consolidating the
cells on the web interfaces.

An optional and final step integrates geometrical shapes in an exist-
ing mesh. SONATA currently supports the use of circular trim masses,
which can be modified to other arbitrary geometries. The correspond-
ing method to map existing nodes onto the contour line of a specified
shape is illustrated in Fig. 8. First, the number of inner nodes for each
cell is determined. During step 1, the inner node of each cell marked
with 1 (.e., one node of that cell is inside the shape) is moved along
the cell edge with the shortest distance to the intersecting curve. Step
2 then moves remaining inner nodes of cells marked with 2 along the
cell edge, again, with the shortest distance to the intersecting curve.
Finally, step 3 moves the outer nodes of cells marked with 3 along
the edge direction onto the intersecting curve. Once the process is
completed, inner cells marked with 3 and 4 are deleted, and a new
unstructured mesh is introduced inside the given shape and allocated
to a defined material property.

SONATA is further capable of splitting quadrature mesh elements
into triangles. This is especially useful for the ANBA4 solver that con-
sistently requires either quadrature or triangular mesh elements, but
does not support the combination of those. Fig. 9 shows a completely
discretized mesh with triangular elements of a cross section displayed

for a generic composite blade. It is based on the same topology as pre-
viously shown in Fig. 6. The final mesh of a cross section along with its
associated material properties are then processed and connected to the
solver, either VABS or ANBA4.

2.5. Solver

SONATA has been implemented to either use the commercial solver
VABS or the open-source solver ANBA4 for conducting the cross-
sectional structural analysis at various sections of slender composite
structures.

2.5.1. VABS

VABS uses the geometrically exact beam theory [18], based on the
variational asymptotic method [19] for determining cross-sectional
structural characteristics. The theory behind it has been explained
by Hodges [48]; for a more detailed insight, refer to some of the
numerous publications with and about VABS [2,14,20—23]. VABS
can nowadays be seen as the standard in both industry and academia
for conducting cross-sectional analysis of composite structures. Studies
in this work were conducted with VABS version 3.4 [21].

2.5.2. ANBA4

At present, ANBA4 (i.e., ANBA version 4.0) is less common com-
pared to VABS. This section, therefore, provides a brief overview of
the fundamental mathematics that ANBA4 is based on. More detailed
information is given by Morandini et al. [25] as well as Zhu and
Morandini [49]. The starting point of ANBA4 is the weak form of
the linear equilibrium equations,

[se:cav =e, (1)
V

where oe is the virtual variation of the small strain tensor,
€ = 1/2(grad(u)" + grad(w)),u is the displacement vector, o = E: € is
the Cauchy stress tensor, FE the elastic tensor, and 6£, is the virtual work
of the external loads. Assume a prismatic, nontwisted beam to be
loaded only by forces per unit of surface, f, at its extremities; i.e., the
start and end radial stations. Integration by parts along the local CBM
curve, x', of the left-hand side of Eq. (1), leads to

| 5u(op —faa) + | 5u(—6n faa
(2)

where grad,(u) is the gradient over the cross-section plane of
u,o6, =o-n is the cross-section stress vector, 65 =o —o-n@®n is the
stress tensor built with the two in-plane stress vectors, and n follows
the x axis direction. The right-hand side of Eq. (2) states the equiva-
lence of the cross-sectional stress vector and of the applied external
loads at the beam extremities. The left-hand side states the equilibrium
equations along the beam. Thus, the beam is in equilibrium if

is satisfied along the beam. The key point behind ANBA4’s formulation
is to recognize that Eq. (3) has a Hamiltonian structure, which is char-
acterized by 12 independent polynomial solutions along the xj axis,
that characterize the unknown displacements field, u. The first six are
simply the rigid body motions, while the remaining six are the solutions
for traction (linear axial displacement relative to xt and constant warp-
ing), torsion (linear torsional rotation relative to xj; and constant warp-
ing), bending in two independent directions (quadratic transverse
displacement, linear cross-section rotation, and constant warping),
and shear-bending (cubic tranverse displacement, quadratic cross-
section rotation, linear and constant warping). The solution procedure
is as follows:

e Approximate the unknown displacement field, u, with a finite ele-
ment discretization defined over the cross sections, such that

U (XY, Xp, X3) = ZN n(%3 5X3) (21) (4)

where N;(x5,x3) are the finite element interpolating functions, and
u(x}) are the nodal displacements as a function of xj. This, from a
practical point of view, requires defining a mesh over the cross sec-
tion and to choose the element polynomial interpolating order.
SONATA, by default, passes a linear order to ANBA4.

e Assemble the matrices obtained by applying the finite element
approximation to Eq. (3). In order to actually compute the inte-
grals, it is necessary to specify the different materials, their consti-
tutive laws, and the material coordinate system; see Fig. 5. Because
Eq. (3) involves the first derivative of the normal stress vector,
0o,/Ox;, three matrices are obtained, and the discretized version
of Eq. (3) is

On Ou
—_— H——~— Fa =
Moe H axe au —0 (5)

Eq. (5) is a second-order homogeneous differential equation. It is
characterized by 12 null eigenvalues and organized into 4 indepen-
dent Jordan chains. The ensuing polynomial solutions are the rigid
body motions and the 6 already-described polynomial deformation
modes.

e By knowing the polynomial solution up to order k, with
u(xt) = Yi itt, it is possible to compute the polynomial solution
of order k + 1 by solving the linear system

Eity.. = Mix, — Hit; (6)

Six linear systems need to be solved in order to compute the corre-
sponding polynomial deformation modes.

Once the polynomial solutions are known, the Timoshenko stiffness
matrix can be computed by stating the equivalence of the beam
internal virtual work per unit of length of the polynomial solutions
and the virtual work from the reaction forces and moments of the
beam model.
R. Feil et al.

Because matrix E is four times singular, particular care needs to be
taken while solving the linear system of Eq. (6). Its nullspace is known
analytically and is equal to the three rigid body motions of the beam
and its constant rotation around x{. To solve the system, it is thus nec-
essary to either constrain the nullspace by means of Lagrange multipli-
ers or resort to an iterative solver and continuously deflate the
nullspace from the solution. Furthermore, in order to correctly com-
pute the cubic solution, one needs to deflate the traction and torsion
of the deformable modes from the two constant-bending parabolic
solutions.

The current implementation of ANBA4 [50] leverages Dolfin
[51,52], a library of the FEniCS project [53,54]. One needs to specify
the mesh, material properties, and orientation angles, according to the
convention of Fig. 5 and the polynomial degree of the cross-section
finite element approximation. After that, one can compute, with a sin-
gle function call, the six polynomial solutions, the cross-sectional iner-
tia, and stiffness matrices. Finally, knowing the six polynomial
solutions, it is possible—for any set of applied loads—to recover the
3D stress and strain states, either in the global or in the material refer-
ence frame.

2.6. Postprocessing

A powerful feature of SONATA consists of the results evaluation
and plotting functionalities. By using the CAD-Kernel OpenCascade
pythonOCC, lofted 3D geometries and 2D meshes can be generated
and extracted. The cross-sectional outputs include the Timoshenko
stiffness matrix, inertia matrix, center of mass, elastic center, and shear
center, as well as the stress, strain, and displacement vectors of each
finite element. Plotting functionalities address those outputs on a 2D
and 3D level. Besides directly evaluating the results through extraction
and plotting of results, the resulting 1D structural properties can be
directly coupled to aeroelastic analysis models. Such coupling can be
wrapped in an OpenMDAO [44] framework to conduct structural
blade design optimization.

3. Box beam numerical analysis

Only a few known means of validation exist for the theory behind
anisotropic beams. Stiffness results can be compared using results from
3D finite element models that have a very high degree of accuracy and
potentially millions of degrees of freedom, or precisely conducted
experiments that are detailed enough to also account for the small
terms. Such validation is beyond the scope of this work and should
be accounted for in future research. In the following, results from
SONATA, using both VABS and ANBA4, are compared to other well-
investigated approaches from literature based on VABS and NABSA
data for the very same test cases. Current verification objectives are
to demonstrate the accuracy of the parametric processing, topology,
and meshing features within SONATA, and its interfaces to VABS
and ANBA4. While VABS is a commercial off-the-shelf solution, the fol-
lowing comparisons of ANBA4 results with both current VABS results
and previous studies from literature serve to gain confidence in using
the current version of ANBA4 as a valuable open-source option. All the
examples make use of linear triangular elements.

Consider a composite box beam in three different CUS layup config-
urations, [0°|,,[—15°],, and [—30°,0°],. The fiber-orientation angles
denoted in this work are in accordance with the coordinate system
shown in Fig. 5. Box beam geometry properties are shown in Table 1
and material properties in Table 2. In terms of the material properties,
layup [—15°]|, has a different Poisson’s ratio of vy, = 0.3. The order of
the given stiffness is: 1 — extension; 2, 3 — shear; 4 — torsion; and 5,
6 — bending. The box beams (see Fig. 10) were analyzed using 200
equidistant points along the outer shape, resulting in a total of 1,481
nodes and 2,536 mesh elements.

Eq. (7) shows the relations between the Timoshenko stiffness
matrix, S, resulting strains, ¢, as well as elastic twist and curvatures,
x, when being loaded to sectional forces, F, and moments, M. The indi-
vidual S; components follow the L-coordinate system conventions; see
Fig. 3.

columns show the results from SONATA, using either VABS or ANBA4
as a structural solver. Table 3 shows that the stiffness values derived
through SONATA between VABS and ANBA4 are identical, and the
comparison of those to NABSA and VABS from previous work success-
fully verifies the accuracy of the SONATA framework. Minor differ-
ences were insignificant and can at least in part be attributed to the
parametric topology and mesh generation in SONATA. One interesting
finding was that the SONATA results between VABS and ANBA4 are
identical, and minor differences can be seen between NABSA and
VABS from literature. However, it eludes the authors’ knowledge
about potential meshing or other differences between those data from

literature.

Fig. 11. Timoshenko stiffness matrix verification between VABS, VABSp (excludes effects from initial twist and curvature), and ANBA4 along the nondimensional
blade span, r/R, for the 15-MW reference wind turbine blade.
R. Feil et al.

Table 4 shows results with all plies being identically oriented in a
[—15°], layup and Table 5 in a [—30°, 0°], layup. Both examples result
in additional extension-torsion, S,,, and shear-bending, S25 and S36,
coupling terms. The SONATA/VABS and SONATA/ANBA4 results
were again identical and both showed excellent agreement with the lit-
erature. Even though VABS results from literature for the [—30°, 0°],
layup are available [22], they were excluded for this work because
they were computed using an older version of VABS. Since VABS ver-
sion 3.2, the energy transformation equations into the generalized
Timoshenko stiffness matrix were redefined, thereby solving two pre-
vious inconsistencies that impacted the predicted generalized
Timoshenko stiffness matrix. Those changes can measurably impact
stiffness results, such as in a box beam layup with nonzero material
orientation angles. This was explained in detail by Ho et al. [55].

4. Wind turbine blade analysis

This section analyzes the recently published 15-MW reference wind
turbine blade [56]. The example demonstrates the capabilities of
SONATA and was appraised suitably to further verify the usage of
ANBA4 in comparison to VABS. The blade is 117 m long and has a root
diameter of 5.2 m, a maximum chord of 5.77 m at r/R = 0.272, anda
mass of approximately 65 tons. The blade 3D geometry and six exem-
plary cross sections were previously illustrated in Fig. 1. Its internal
structure consists of unidirectional and triaxial glass-composite mate-
rials, carbon-composite spar caps, and additional layers of foam and

gelcoat. Fig. 11 shows the fully resolved symmetrical Timoshenko stiff-
ness matrix of the blade structural characteristics. Fig. 12 furthermore
presents the inertia properties, including the section mass, y, the mass
moment of inertia, i22, about the x2 axis, the mass moment of inertia,
i33, about the x3 axis, and the product of inertia, i23, as well as the mass
center, x,,, the tension center, x,, and the shear center, x,, locations.
Results were computed at 21 equidistant radial station cross sections.
The shear center, or so-called elastic axis, is the point in a cross section
where the application of loads does not cause elastic twisting, and the
tension center, or so-called neutral axis, is the point in a cross section
that encounters zero longitudinal stresses or strains (i.e., zero axial
force) when being applied with bending moments.

VABSpr data represent the reduced form of the VABS results,
neglecting effects from initial twist and curvature. Hence, it accounts
for the same features and is, therefore, well suited for a code-to-code
comparison with ANBA4. Within the assumption of neglecting initial
twist and curvature, results in Figs. 11 and 12 show that—besides
being verified through box beam examples (see Section 3)—the verifi-
cation of ANBA4 was again successful when applied to a fully resolved
wind turbine blade. ANBA4 can, therefore, be seen as an applicable
and open-source solver within SONATA for the analysis of slender
composite structures such as blades.

The wind turbine blade incorporates axial-bend, S,; and Sj., and
bend-bend, Ss,, coupling terms. Because of the plies being entirely ori-
ented in an axial direction, bend-twist coupling (S45 and S4¢) originates
solely from initial twist and curvature; see VABS results in Fig. 11.

with BeamDyn.
R. Feil et al.

SONATA determines the initial state inputs automatically, based on
the outer geometry of the blade. Note that this feature is yet to be
added for ANBA4. Small discontinuities in the VABS results (e.g., S24
or X,3) are based on the initial twist and curvature states in a cross sec-
tion and may, at least in part, originate from slightly inaccurate outer
shape definitions of the blade model. The shear-center location is a
function of the shear-torsion coupling terms, x. =/f(S34) and
X33 =f (S24). Therefore, x,; shows similar fluctuating characteristics
as So4. Detailed sensitivity studies and potential impacts from initial
states on the blades’ aeroelastic behavior will be investigated in future
work.

Fig. 13 shows recovered strains (see also Eq. 7) of one blade cross
section at about 1/3 span. The results shown were determined using
ANBA4 but are identical with VABS. Applied cross-sectional loads
were determined using BeamDyn within OpenFAST at an above-
rated steady wind speed of 12 m/s, which incorporated the fully
resolved mass and stiffness matrices (see Fig. 11) from SONATA.
BeamDyn uses the geometrically exact beam theory [18] for 1D beams,
based on the Legendre spectral finite element method. Resulting
strains were dominated by flapwise moments. Conducting such recov-
ery analysis results in stresses, strains, and deformations in any direc-
tion. Those are important to analyze and optimize blades based on
material safety constraints. Fig. 13 furthermore shows the resulting
mass center, neutral axes, and shear center that were again success-
fully verified between VABS and ANBA4; see Fig. 12.

5. Conclusions

This work presents the methodology of SONATA, an efficient para-
metric design framework to investigate slender composite structures.
SONATA’s parametrization, cross-sectional topology generation, and
mesh discretization approaches, as well as the structural solvers (VABS
and ANBA4) for determining the stiffness characteristics are presented
and verified. The tool features coupling to aeroelastic analysis and
enables structural composite-blade design analysis and optimization.
The following specific conclusions can be drawn:

e Using ANBA4 instead of VABS extends the SONATA framework to
being a fully open-source available cross-sectional structural analy-
sis and optimization environment that can be applied to either
rotorcraft, wind turbine blades, or other slender composite struc-
tures of arbitrary cross sections.

e SONATA’s parametric preprocessing, topology generation, mesh
discretization, and solver integration of both VABS and ANBA4
were successfully verified through a comparison with literature
results of composite box beams derived through VABS and NABSA.

e Embedded in SONATA, both VABS and ANBA4 proved to be well
suited to analyze complex slender composite structures, such as
modern large and highly flexible wind turbine blades, including
stress and strain recovery as well as bend-twist coupling effects.

e The SONATA framework effectively enables 3D blade design in
connection with 1D beam finite element models. This allows a tight
connection between aeroelastic analysis simulation and the
blade-structural design, thereby offering a systematic development
process for high-fidelity and multidisciplinary blade optimization.

e To enhance the confidence of modern rotorcraft or wind turbine
blade designs and better address cost and safety requirements,
SONATA allows to incorporate material failure criteria, manufac-
turing constraints, and material and manufacturing uncertainties.
Material failure criteria can be accounted for in the design process
by recovering stresses and strains with strong connection to aeroe-
lastic simulations.

The parametric modeling approach to investigate slender compos-
ite structures with a high-fidelity structural accuracy provides an effec-

10

tive analysis and optimization framework. It will further be used for
multidisciplinary blade optimization tasks with both helicopter and
wind turbine blade applications to account for the entire rotor system
with respect to target objectives such as performance, mean and vibra-
tory loads, blade deflections, aeroelastic stability, and structural integ-
rity. Future work will extend ANBA4 to also account for initial twist
and curvature effects, and further verification studies will include
comparisons to 3D finite element models.
