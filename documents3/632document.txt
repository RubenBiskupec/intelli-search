Abstract

Wireless sensor network (WSN) can effectively help us monitor the surrounding environment and prevent the
occurrence of some natural disasters earlier, but we can only get the information of the surrounding environment
correctly if we know the locations of nodes. How to know the exact positions of nodes is a strict challenge in WSN.
Intelligent computing algorithms have been developed in recent years. They easily solve complex optimization
problems, especially for those that cannot be modeled mathematically. This paper proposes a novel algorithm,

named parallel whale optimization algorithm (PWOA). It contains two information exchange strategies between
groups, and it significantly enhances global search ability and population diversity of the original whale optimization
algorithm (WOA). Also, the algorithm is adopted to optimize the localization of WSN. Twenty-three mathematical
optimization functions are accustomed to verifying the efficiency and effectiveness of the novel approach. Compared
with some existing intelligent computing algorithms, the proposed PWOA may reach better results.

1 Introduction

Algorithms of intelligent computing have achieved rapid
development, and many animal swarm phenomenon
inspires people to propose related new algorithms, such
as whale optimization algorithm(WOA) [1-5], particle
swarm optimization (PSO) [6-9], grey wolf optimization
(GWO) [10, 11], cat swarm optimization (CSO) [12, 13],
and artificial bee colony (ABC) [14]. They are successful
examples of imitating intelligent behaviors of animals. In
addition, in order to advance the performance of these
algorithms, several methods are proposed [15-19]. The
algorithms randomly separate individuals into a limited
area in the first phase, and then they use a large vari-
ety of equations to update the positions of individuals.
The PSO uses two-elements, i.e., Ppest ANd Yhest. They are
used to adjust the velocity of individuals. The ppest attracts
particles exploiting around the self-best position and the
Lbest attracts particles exploiting around the global best

position. When Ppest has a relatively large weight, the algo-
rithm has more chances to explore the promising area; on
the contrary, the algorithm spends more time in exploit-
ing around the global best position. The running process
of CSO is similar to PSO, and it is inspired by cats. In the
real world, the cats do not spend all time to catch prey,
and they usually take more time to observe the around
environments, so the algorithm introduces the modes of
seeking and tracing to mimic the action of cats. In the
first mode, each individual explores as many as possible
areas around its position. While in another model, the
population does something similar with PSO, and each
individual aggregates to global best position. The ABC
algorithm cancels the influence of the global best individ-
ual, and the bees have the probability to become onlooker
bees or employed bees. The latter explores the environ-
ment around its position and according to fitness value,
the former chooses one employed bee to follow. A bet-
ter employed bee has a larger probability to be followed.
Finally, the algorithm returns the best fitness value found
by all bees. GWO algorithm makes subtle changes about
the influence of the global best individual. In addition, the
algorithm proposes an elaborate equation to imitate the

catch movement of the grey wolf. The algorithm regards
the average value of three elites as the prey, and other
individuals exploit by far from or close to the prey.

With the development of WSN, there are many prob-
lems of security and data fusion in transmitting proce-
dures [20-26]. People can conveniently obtain important
information in many scenes, for example, forest fire-
prevention, predict nature disaster [27, 28], and rescue
action after a disaster and marine monitoring. Utilizing
the amount of data, we can predict something [29, 30]. To
get correct information about monitor objects, the lives
and positions of sensors are important for WSN [31-35].
A simple solution of this problem is to attach GPS to each
node, but this way has a disadvantage, that is GPS is an
expensive module, and the sizes of most sensor nodes are
minor to conveniently layout, so it is not a practical way
that all nodes equip with GPS modules. The node location
of WSN usually consists of a range phase and evaluation
phase. In the former phase, the distances of sensor nodes
to anchors are evaluated by receiving signal strength indi-
cator (RSSI) [36-38] and distance vector-hop (DV-Hop),
and so on. This paper applies an intelligence computing
algorithm to compensate for the deviation between the
estimated position and actual position in the last phase.

In this paper, communication strategies are accustomed
to advancing the property of WOA. We use 23 traditional
mathematical test functions to indicate the performance
of the novel algorithm, and the simulation results show
it has better searchability than other existing algorithms.
Furthermore, the new algorithm is applied to WSN local-
ization and gets an excellent result.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2,
we mainly introduce the WOA algorithm and DV-Hop
method used in WSN localization. Section 3 explains in
detail the proposed communication strategies of PWOA
and how to combine the novel algorithm with DV-Hop
method. The data from the simulation results are used to
discuss the efficiency of the algorithm and the effective-
ness of applying in the DV-Hop method in Section 4 and
the summary of this paper in Section 5.

2.1 Whale optimization algorithm
Mirjalili et al. inspired by the prey action of whales,
proposes the WOA algorithm, and this algorithm is a
promising intelligence computing algorithm. The hump-
back whales’ hunting method is so interesting. They prefer
to catch prey closing to the surface and this behavior is
called bubble-net feeding method by people, because the
hunting trails sometimes look like circles, and sometimes
they look like the number nine.

The author provides the mathematical model about
whale hunt action, and this model divides the hunt action
into two phases, i.e., surrounding prey and bubble-net

(2020) 2020:50 Page 2 of 10

attacking method. The algorithm mimics the action of the
whale population surrounding the prey. In the real world,
the whale can recognize the position of prey, but we do
not know where target prey is in a mathematical model, so
the algorithm hypothesis the current global best position
as the target prey and other whales gradually move to this
position. The process of surrounding prey is presented as
the following equations:

D=|U-Py. — P| (1)
1
PO =P —-V-D (2)

The ¢ in the above equation means the current iteration
number, V and U are variables that vary with the number
of iterations. P’ and Pp est are the individual locations and
the global best position at the ¢th iteration and Py, will
update when finding a better position. The values of V and
U are calculated by the following equations:

V =2v-r-v (3)
U=2-r (4)

The v decrease from 2 to 0 as the number of iterations
increases and r is arandom number between 0 and 1. The
value of v is changing along with iteration, so the value
of V is a variable between — 2 and 2. In the exploitation
phase, the V is set to [— 1, 1], and individuals can travel
anywhere between their current locations and their prey.
As V gets smaller and smaller, the population gets closer
and closer to the prey, so the algorithm exploits promising
areas around the current global best position.

The bubble-net attacking method mimics whale attack-
ing the prey. This method consists of two approaches:
shrinking encircling mechanism and spiral updating posi-
tion. The former depends on the value of V in the Eqs. (2)
and (3), on account of the v decrease, the encircle range is
smaller gradually. In the next iteration, the position of the
individual may be anywhere between the prey and its own
position.

The spiral updating position makes full use of the cos
function to simulate the shape of the whale’s hunting path.
The equation below is used to update the position of an
individual:

Pl _ p.e™. cos(2ah) + Pr act (5)

where D is calculated by Eq. (1), and it means the distance
of the individual to the global best position ever found.
The form of the logarithmic spiral is defined by s, and h is
a rand number between — 1 and 1.

This algorithm uses probability to determine which
approach is adopted, and the above two approaches have
an equal chance to update the position of the individual. A
question we must consider is that if the algorithm exploits
around only one prey, the algorithm easily be trapped
into local optimal value, so the algorithm uses a similar-
ity equation to achieve explore operation. When |V| > 1,
Chai et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

the algorithm will randomly choose an individual as prey
instead of the global best position. In other words, the
algorithm randomly chooses an individual to replace the
Pp est Of Eqs. (1) and (2). The below equations are used to
present the mathematical model:

D=|U- Ping — Pl (6)
ptt —pl4-V-D (7)

The Pt,,q is an individual chosen randomly from the

current population.

2.2 Localization problem in WSN

WSN has been widely used in our life, for example, forest
fire-prevention, rescue action after a disaster, and marine
monitoring. In order to obtain correct information, it is
particularly important to accurately identify the location
of nodes in the real world. Now the common methods
are RSSI and DV-Hop, and the details of DV-Hop will be
introduced in this section.

When solving the problem of localization in WSN, peo-
ple often consider using the DV-Hop method [39]. This
method estimates the linear distances between nodes by
calculating the distance between each node, so it does
not need complex hardware. Low cost and convenience to
implement is the advantage of this method. The disadvan-
tage of this method is the hop distance is used instead of
the linear distance, so the results obtained by the DV-Hop
method exists a larger error between actual distance and
estimate distance.

Estimating distance about each hop is the key opera-
tion to recognize the positions of nodes in DV-Hop. After
randomly decorating nodes, the method calculates the
distances between anchor nodes and then calculates the
distance of each hop of anchor nodes. Assume the method
calculates the distance of each hop of A anchor node.
Firstly, the method looks for the path with the least hops
between A and the other anchor nodes. Then the method
computes the distance of each hop of node A, which is
the sum of their distances divided by the number of hops
between them. To better illustrate the process of DV-Hop,
we present Fig. 1.

We can see the distribution condition of the WSN in
Fig. 1. Orange indicates the unknown nodes and unknown
nodes mean they are not equipped with GPS models. The
blue nodes are anchor nodes. There are ten routes from A
to D. The method chooses the route that has minimal hops
between A and D, so we utilize the same method to get the
number of hops from A to B, C, D, and E, and they are 3, 2,
2, and 4, respectively. Assume the distances from A to B,
C, D, and E are 12m, 8m, 12m, and 20m, respectively, and
the distance of one hop of A is calculated by the equation
below.

node. The coordinates of the ith and jth anchor nodes
are represented by (p;,q;) and (pj, qj). The hop; is min-
imal counts of hops from ith to jth anchor node. Then
we acquire the distance that one hop of A anchor node
is 4.73m. The distance is computed by multiplying the
number of hops with the distance per hop.

3 APWOA with two communication strategies
applied in DV-Hop localization method

This section mainly introduces the communication strate-
gies of PWOA. The communication strategy can transfer
effective information between groups, so the performance
of this algorithm is improved by using these communi-
cation strategies. After this, the localization problem in
WSN is solved by the new algorithm.

3.1 Tribal annexation communication strategy

Normally, the swarm intelligence computing algorithm
has one or two influence vectors, such as PSO, ABC, and
CSO. The fewer influence vector leads to algorithms with
faster convergence rates, but the algorithms are not rich in
diversity. Traditional communication strategy in parallel
algorithms is trying to change the information exchange
way rather than the account of groups. In the process of
civilization development, there are often annexation and
integration between civilizations. In this way, although the
weak civilization is annexed, as a new group, they learn the
culture and technology of another advanced civilization.

Inspired by this, this communication strategy divides
the population to many groups and starts to explore and
exploit, respectively. This operation is similar to the self-
development of the tribe, then after a certain number of
iterations, two neighbor groups are merged to be a new
group. For example, the first group and second group
become a first group in the future iteration. Through
this process, the new group has information about two
groups before merging, so the global best individual of
the new group needs to update. Figure 2 helps us better
understand the merged process.

In the initial phase, this communication strategy divides
the population into eight subgroups, so that the algo-
rithm has more chances to avoid the local optimal value.
At the later running process, this strategy by merging
groups delivers the optimal information to a new group. In
other words, the final group contains information about
eight groups in the initial phase. Because this strategy
explores the more promising area than the original WOA

algorithm, so it has more chances to avoid local optimal
value.

3.2 Herd mentality communication strategy

One of the challenges in our lives is to avoid doing the
same things with others or being influenced by the actions
of those around us. This phenomenon may make it diffi-
cult for us to do something. For example, more and more
people study the knowledge about computers, and if you

major computer, you would have the challenge of find-
ing a comfortable job after graduating from university or
college. But this phenomenon also can efficiently make
sure you avoid some terrible things sometimes. Most peo-
ple study computer knowledge, and although it is hard
for you to find a comfortable job, you have more work
chance, so you have a smaller probability of losing your
job. This paper proposes a communication strategy that
mimics the above phenomenon. This strategy divides the

population into some groups, then respectively runs the
traditional WOA algorithm. When the number of itera-
tion reaches Ro, Eq. (9) is used to update the positions of
some individuals which can be chosen randomly:

Xd = 104408» Prreant (9)

where the Xap indicates the value of a random individ-
ual in the dth dimension at the (¢ + 1) iteration and R
is arandom number between zero and group population

size. The P jean, is the dth dimensional value of the mean

position of all individuals at the fth iteration. This com-
munication strategy randomly selects the same quantity
of individuals from every group, and they are replaced by
the Pmean in some dimension; if the algorithm produces a
better position than a group’s best position, the algorithm
would update the group’s best position. This communi-
cation strategy increases the diversity of the population
by introducing the average position of the population so
that individuals can have more choices to avoid the whole
species having a similar value.

3.3. Apply the PWOA in DV-Hop localization method

In the second phase of localization, this paper utilizes
the distance that has obtained in the first phase to rec-
ognize the position of the unknown node, and it applies
PWOA in solving this problem. There are some distance
errors between anchor nodes and unknown nodes, and it
is calculated by the below equation:

mM
errorj = Vi -— B+ Gi - GH)? - (10)
i=1

The error; indicates the sum of distance errors of jth
unknow node to all anchor nodes. The (p;, g;) is the coor-
dinate of ith anchor node, and the position of the jth
unknown node is represented by (pj, qj). The m is the
account of anchor nodes, and dj is the distance from
the ith anchor node to jth unknow node estimated by
the DV-Hop localization method. In order to improve the
accuracy of localization, we utilize the following fitness
equation and PWOA to achieve this object:

Mm
Fun(y,q) = min) |) @ — pi)? + @- qi)? - di
i=1

The d; is the estimated distance between unknown nodes
and ith anchor node. The actual position of the unknown
node is (p, g) and the coordinate of the ith anchor node is
represented by (pj, qj). All individuals of WOA represent
the positions of sensor nodes, then we use Eqs. (1), (2), (5),
and (11) to find the best position in a limited area; in other
words, we minimize the error of the unknown node.

4 Results and discussion

The simulation results that the novel algorithm under
mathematical test functions and application effect in the
DV-Hop localization method are shown in this section.

4.1 Simulation results on mathematic test function
Twenty-three classical mathematical test functions in [10]
are used to verify the performance of the novel algorithm
in this paper. Although these functions are simple, they
can distinguish the performance difference between the
new algorithm and other algorithms.

To evaluate the performance of the novel approach, this
paper compares the novel algorithm with the conven-
tional optimization algorithm PSO and the original WOA
algorithm. Table 1 shows the parameter settings of those
compared algorithms.

The first communication strategy of PWOA (PWOAS1)
is tribal annexation communication strategy, and the
number of groups is reduced from eight to one in four
separate processes. The iteration number is one thousand,
so R; is set to 250. The second communication strategy
of PWOA (PWOAS2) is herd mentality communication
strategy, and the value of Ry is smaller than R) because
the second communication strategy moves the population
toward the mean position of the whole population. The
more frequent communication between groups, the more
stable the algorithm, and the algorithm has more chances
to avoid trapping in a local optimal area.

In Table 2, we can see the results that the novel algo-
rithm compares with PSO and original WOA algorithm
in mean value and standard deviation of 30 runs. The
PWOAS1 obtains 16 better results and 4 same results
compared with PSO in all test functions. It has stronger
searchability than original WOA in 10 test functions,
and in 6 test functions, they produce similar results.
The PWOAS2 acquires 15 better results and 4 same
results than PSO, and in 9 test functions, it has better
performance than the original WOA algorithm. The per-
formance is the same for 6 test functions. In addition,
we utilize the Wilcoxon method making non-parametric
statistical hypothesis test [40], and we can see the test
results from Table 3. The data is obtained by run 30 times
for every test function. Some values are “NaN” because
WOA under fo or fi; test functions has the same value as

PWOAS1 or PWOAS2. If the values of Table 3 are less
than 0.05 means the performance of the novel algorithm
is obviously better than other algorithms.

The test functions are chosen in this paper includ-
ing unimodal functions and multimodal functions. From
Fig. 3, we can obtain the convergence details of PSO,
WOA, and PWOA under 23 classical mathematics test
functions. To be faired prove the PWOA has better per-
formance than PSO and WOA, the data used for plotting
is the average result of 30 runs and the parameters of the
algorithms as Table 1 shows.

As the novel algorithm has two communication strate-
gies, it has more choices to avoid the local optimal value.
Tribal annexation communication strategy separates the
population into several groups in the initial phase and
the groups merge into one group gradually. In this pro-
cess, the final group contains all information of the initial
groups, so this communication strategy has more chance
to find the optimal value. Herd mentality communication
strategy introduces the mean position value of the whole
population to increase the diversity of the algorithm, so
the algorithm can avoid local optimal value.

In most test functions, we can clearly see the difference
in optimal results or convergence rates between 4 algo-
rithms. But in f, to f7, the PWOA obtains similar results
with WOA, except for /3 and f4, because these functions
are unimodal function. They are too simple to distinguish

the performance difference between WOA and PWOA.
In addition, the novel algorithm has a slower convergence
rate than the WOA algorithm due to the communication
action takes some time.

Compared with unimodal functions, there are many
local optimal areas in multimodal function; if the algo-
rithm has no powerful exploring ability, it would easily
be trapped in a local optimal area. In fg to fo3 test func-
tions, the PWOA algorithm is more competitive than
other algorithms. In every certain number of iterations,
the PWOA exchanges information between groups mak-
ing the new algorithm obtain more exploration region
information than the original algorithm. Through the
comparison of the above experiments, we can get a
conclusion that the PWOA algorithm has more out-
standing performance than the original WOA and PSO
algorithms.

4.2 Simulation results of PWOA applied in DV-Hop
localization method

This paper combines PWOA with DV-Hop to solve the
localization problem for WSN. We compare the simu-
lation results of PWOA-based DV-Hop with DV-Hop,
WOA-based DV-Hop, and PSO-based DV-Hop. The
coordinates of sensor nodes are calculated by the least
square method in DV-Hop, while other methods use intel-
ligent computing algorithms. All simulation experiments
are implemented by MATLAB 2014a and the data is the
average of 30 runs of independent trials. The iteration is
set as 100 and other parameters are shown as in Table 1.
The average localization error is used to evaluate the
property of the localization method, which is given as
follows:

el Vv (Pe — Pe)? + (Qe — de)”

mx R

ALE = (12)

The m is the number of unknown nodes, and ALE means
average localization error of all unknown nodes in whole
WSN. The (pe, ge) is the estimated coordinate of the eth
unknown node and the actual position of the eth unknown
node is represented by (Pe, Q-). Each node has the same
communication radius R.

4.3. Sensitivity of varying anchor node amount

In this experiment, randomly dispersing 200 nodes in a
100 m x100 m sensing region. In each test, the num-
ber of anchor nodes was 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40,
respectively.

From Table 4, we can see that by comparing the DV-
Hop- and PSO-based DV-Hop, the PWOA is more com-
petitive. The more anchor nodes are placed, the estimated
position of the unknown node is more accurate. In other
words, the problem is easier to solve, so if there are a

large number of anchor nodes, the performance difference
would difficulty be found between algorithms.

4.4 Sensitivity of node density

In order to know the influence of node density on exper-
imental data, each test has the same amount of anchor
nodes and a different number of unknown nodes in
this experiment, and we randomly disperse nodes in a
100 m x 100 m sensing region. The communication radius
of all nodes is 20 m.

Table 5 shows that the localization error increases with
the number of unknown nodes. This is because the num-
ber of unknown nodes influences the complexity of the
WSN localization problem. From Table 5, we can see
that in the case of a large number of unknown nodes,
the performance of PWOA-based DV-Hop is better than
other localization methods. So, the novel algorithm we
proposed is more suitable for solving complex problems.

Figure 3 shows the variation of fitness value along with
iteration number between algorithms, PWOAS1-based
DV-Hop, and PWOAS2-based DV-Hop. There are 195
unknown nodes and 5 anchor nodes in this experiment,
and the communication range of each node are 20 m. We
can see the two novel communication strategies are both
better than other algorithms. The proposed PWOA can
be further improved by combining some useful methods
[41-45].

5 Conclusion

In this paper, PWOA is presented to solve the WSN
localization problem, and it consists of two communica-
tion strategies. The first strategy is by merging groups
to achieve information communication, and it adequately
exploits the promising area. The second strategy intro-
duces the influence of the average position of the whole
population. Through the 23 classical test functions, we
clearly understand the performance of the new algorithm,
and from simulation, we see the novel algorithm has

apply the novel algorithm in DV-Hop localization method
and compare it with DV-Hop, PSO-based DV-Hop, and
WOA-based DV-Hop. Although the problem is so simple,
the novel algorithm also gets excellent results.

In the future, we can further propose new communica-
tion strategies and combine the parallel method and other
enhance ability method, and we believe that they can get
excellent results.
