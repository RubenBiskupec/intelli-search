Abstract

Explosive spalling is an unfavorable phenomenon observed in concrete when exposed to heating load. It is a great potential
threat to safety of concrete structures subjected to accidental thermal loads. Therefore, assessing explosive spalling risk of
concrete is important for fire safety design of concrete structures. This paper proposed a popular machine learning approach,
1.e., artificial neural network (ANN), to assess explosive spalling risk of concrete. Besides, the decision tree method was
also used to execute the same mission for a comparison purpose. Twenty-eight groups of heating tests were conducted to
validate the proposed ANN model. The ANN model behaved well in assessing explosive spalling of concrete, with a predic-
tion accuracy of 82.1%. This study shows that ANN is a promising method for adequate classification of concrete as material

resistant or not resistant to thermal explosive spalling.

1 Introduction

When concrete is under heating (for example, a fire), there
is a risk of thermal instability that occurs in the form of
spalling. Fire spalling of concrete reduces section of con-
crete members, exposes embedded rebar directly to fire load,
and thereby accelerates failure of concrete members. The
local failure of concrete structural members tends to trig-
ger a progressive collapse of the whole structure. There-
fore, understanding why fire spalling occurs in concrete and
furthermore assessing fire spalling risk of concrete are two
important research topics.

Regarding the first topic, many studies have contributed
to understanding of the underlying driving mechanism
to initiate fire spalling of concrete [1-3]. There are three
main types of mechanisms on fire spalling of concrete: pore

pressure mechanism, thermal stress mechanism, and com-
bined pore pressure and thermal stress mechanism. Pore
pressure mechanism claims that fire spalling of concrete is
caused by vapor pressure in concrete pores. Thermal stress
mechanism assumes that fire spalling of concrete is induced
by restraint-induced thermal stress. Combined pore pres-
sure and thermal stress mechanism states that fire spalling of
concrete is a result of combined action of vapor pressure and
restraint-induced thermal stress. Despite many implemented
studies, no consensus agreement on the relative contribution
of the influencing factors on the fire spalling phenomenon
has been achieved in the research community.

More recently, Liu et al. [4] proposed a unified fire-
induced concrete spalling theory based on the work con-
tributed by the research community. In the theory, fire
spalling of concrete is classified into three categories based
on their respective mechanism: thermo-hygral spalling,
thermo-mechanical spalling, and thermo-chemical spalling.
According to the unified fire-induced concrete theory [4],
the influence factors of each type of spalling are summa-
rized in Table 1. Thermo-hygral spalling, commonly termed
“explosive spalling’, is a result of vapor pressure inside con-
crete. In this paper, we will use explosive spalling instead of
thermo-hygral spalling for ease of understanding. Explosive
spalling of concrete typically occurs at a material tempera-
ture between 220 and 320 °C, making it the most dangerous

type of fire spalling. In contrast, thermo-mechanical spalling
and thermo-chemical spalling need a higher temperature to
initiate, with 430—660 °C for thermo-mechanical spalling
and 700 °C above for thermo-chemical spalling. Therefore,
there is a need to predict whether explosive spalling of con-
crete will occur, which is the second important research
topic mentioned in the first paragraph.

So far a number of numerical predictive models [5-8]
have been proposed to predict explosive spalling of concrete
based on finite difference method or finite element method.
However, these spalling models are validated against lim-
ited test data with assumed permeability values. It is widely
acknowledged that permeability plays a vital role in explo-
sive spalling resistance of concrete under heating. However,
the measured permeability values can vary significantly for
concrete using different test methods. Moreover, the per-
meability values of concrete were measured either at an
isothermal state or a residual state, while what numerical
models need is the permeability of concrete at a transient
heating state. This renders the traditional numerical method
not a so effective approach to predict explosive spalling of
concrete, although these models do give us insights into
thermo-hygral behavior of concrete at elevated tempera-
ture. Thereby, we resort to a completely different approach,
machine learning, to predict explosive spalling of concrete
under thermal load.

Machine learning is an application of artificial intel-
ligence that allows systems to automatically learn from
existing sample data without being explicitly programmed.
Artificial neural network (ANN) is a common tool used in
machine learning. As the “neural” part of its name suggests,
it is a brain-inspired system which aims to replicate the way
humans learn. ANN has been used by many researchers for

good prediction performance was generally observed using
ANN.

Explosive spalling of concrete involves highly complex
and nonlinear coupled thermo-hygral behavior, which is
extremely difficult to model using traditional FEM or FDM.
ANN provides an alternative way to model nonlinear, uncer-
tain complex systems without any explicit knowledge about
input/output relationship. It could be a better solution to
predict explosive spalling of concrete at the current stage.
More recently, Seitllari, Naser [11] applied ANN to predict
explosive spalling in reinforced concrete columns. In their
ANN model, concrete strength, width of RC column, magni-
tude of eccentricity and applied load were used as the input
parameter. However, explosive spalling resistance is intrinsic
attribute of concrete itself, i.e. explosive spalling is highly
related to concrete mix proportions and ingredients used in
concrete. Moisture content, heating rate, and size of aggre-
gate are also the important parameters that can determine
whether explosive spalling will occur in concrete or not.

In this paper, we applied ANN to predict explosive
spalling of concrete under heating load. Eleven parameters,
1.e., water/binder ratio, silica fume/binder ratio, fly ash/
binder ratio, GGBS/binder ratio, fine aggregate/binder ratio,
coarse aggregate/binder ratio, moisture content, heating rate,
maximum exposure temperature, characteristic length of
specimen, and maximum aggregate size, were selected as
input parameters. For a comparison purpose, another popu-
lar machine learning method, the decision tree method was
also used to make predictions using the same input param-
eters. It should be noted that, in this study, the effects of
silica fume, GGBS, fly ash on explosive spalling resistance
of concrete are also incorporated in the ANN model, as these

supplementary cementitious materials are widely used in
modern concrete for high performance and reducing carbon
footprint. A dataset of 265 test results was used to train the
proposed ANN model. The dataset for ANN training are
collected via a comprehensive review of literature. A set
of validation tests was conducted to examine the capability
of the ANN model to predict explosive spalling of differ-
ent types of concrete. The developed ANN model showed a
good predictive accuracy, and is a promising tool for assess-
ing explosive spalling of concrete as it gradually improves.

2 Artificial neural network (ANN)

An ANN is a mathematical model inspired by biological
neural networks. Basic element of every ANN is artificial
neuron, which represents a simple mathematical function.
As shown in Fig. 1, ANN has an N-layered (typically N=3)
structure with artificial neurons in each layer. The first layer
is called input layer, the middle layer is called intermediate
layer, and the last layer is called output layer.

The input layer is the fed data from external sources. The
neurons in the input layer are non-operational units, while
the neurons in hidden and output layers are operational units.
The neurons in adjacent layers are fully connected to each
other. Figure 2 shows a fundamental representation of an
operational artificial neuron, which processes input data
from previous layers and transfers the output data to conse-
quent layers. The mathematical expression of an operational
artificial neuron can be written as Eq. (1).

where X;, is the input value from previous layer, w, is the
weight of neural input value, b is the neuron’s bias, F is a
transfer function, Y is the output value.

The transfer function can be selected based on the feature
of the problem. In this study, we used the rectified (ReLU)
transfer function on the intermediate layer and the sigmoid
transfer function on the output layer. It used to be the case
that tanh and sigmoid transfer functions were preferred for
intermediate layers before emergence of ReLU transfer func-
tion. Recently, better performance was observed using the
ReLU transfer function. So ReLU transfer function was used
on the intermediate layer in this study. Predicting whether a
concrete mix 1s susceptible to explosive spalling, essentially,
is a binary classification problem. Therefore, sigmoid trans-
fer function 1s used on the output layer, with an output of O
meaning explosive spalling-free and 1 meaning the opposite.

In ANN, a training process is an iterative process that
requires updating the weights and biases to create a good
mapping of input to output. The training process is solved
using an optimization algorithm that finds out a set of
weights that produce a good performance on the training
dataset. In this paper, Adam algorithm [12] is used as the
optimizer for the ANN model. Adam algorithm has been
gaining popularity since its first appearance in 2014. This
algorithm is computationally efficient and suitable for non-
stationary problems with very noisy gradients. Furthermore,
it requires litthe memory and shows huge performance gains
in terms of speed of training.

2.1 Input and output parameters

One key element of an ANN is qualified data used for
training, which includes input data and output data. So the
priority is to determine the input parameters and output
results. The ANN model in this study is to predict whether
a concrete mix will spall explosively subjected to heat load.
Therefore, concrete mix proportions are undoubtedly crucial
input parameters. To eliminate a possible bias which might
be induced using absolute quantities of concrete ingredients,
water/binder ratio, silica fume/binder ratio, fly ash/binder
ratio, GGBS/binder ratio, fine aggregate/binder ratio, coarse
aggregate/binder ratio are used as input parameters to rep-
resent a concrete mix.

In addition to concrete mix parameters, moisture con-
tent, heating rate, maximum exposure temperature, dimen-
sion of concrete specimen and maximum aggregate size are
also the important factors to determine explosive spalling
resistance of concrete. Therefore, these parameters are also
selected as input parameters. Characteristic length 1s intro-
duced to represent the influence of specimen dimension on
explosive spalling resistance of concrete in the ANN model.
Characteristic length is defined as the minimal distance of
shortest escape route of vapor from specimen centroid to the
specimen surface. For example, the characteristic length of
a cylinder specimen is illustrated in Fig. 3. If the height of
the cylinder is larger than its diameter, then its characteristic
length is its radius, otherwise, its characteristic length is half
of its height.

The expected output is whether the input concrete mix
will spall explosively under heating. But the outcome of an
ANN model has to be numerical, for example real values.
Therefore, the output value of our ANN model is set to be
class variable (O or 1). Class value | is interpreted as “the
input concrete mix is vulnerable to explosive spalling”, and

class value 0 is interpreted as “the input concrete mix is free
from explosive spalling”.

2.2 Network data preparation

To summarize, there are 11 input parameters and | output
parameters for the target ANN model. The 11 input param-
eters are water/binder ratio, silica fume/binder ratio, fly
ash/binder ratio, GGBS/binder ratio, fine aggregate/binder
ratio, coarse aggregate/binder ratio, moisture content, heat-
ing rate, maximum exposure temperature, characteristic
length of specimen and maximum aggregate size. Exten-
sive experimental studies have been done to test explosive
spalling resistance and residual or hot mechanical proper-
ties of concrete. However, many of them did not provide all
information on the 11 input parameters. In this study, 265
test results from [1—3, 13-31] are used to train the presented
ANN model. The test results from these published literature
were compiled and summarized in “Table 9 in Appendix 1”.

The following rules apply regarding preparing the net-
work input data from the literature:

e Ifthe specimens are subjected to nonlinear fire, for exam-
ple, ISO 834 fire, the maximum exposure temperature is
taken as the fire temperature at 30 min and the heating
rate is taken as the linear heating rate up to the exposure
temperature at 30 min.

e If the specimens are subjected to multi-stage heating as
shown in Fig. 4, the heating rate is taken as the linear
heating rate up to the maximum exposure temperature.

e The moisture content of concrete is defined as the weight
loss of concrete after drying to constant mass at 105 °C.
In the case that only the weight loss of concrete drying at
120 °C is available, the moisture content is taken as 80%
of the weight loss of concrete at 120 °C.

As long as one out of several concrete specimens was
observed to spall violently, the concrete mix is deemed
to be vulnerable to explosive spalling.

Table 2 shows the ranges of network input data parame-
ters extracted from the literature. As shown in Table 2, silica
fume/binder ratio, fly ash/binder ratio, and GGBS/binder
ratio were selected as the input parameters among others
so that ANN models are able to consider the effect of silica
fume, fly ash and GGBS. A wide scatter of parameter values
from the collected data, as shown in Table 2, is desirable for
a proper set of training data.

2.3 Artificial neural network set-up

Currently, there are no universally applied theories for
choosing the suitable network architecture. So a number of
network architectures were established and stratified tenfold
cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of

the network architectures. Cross-validation is a technique to
evaluate predictive ANN models by partitioning the original
sample into a training set to train the model, and a test set to
evaluate it. In tenfold cross-validation, the original sample
is randomly partitioned into ten subsamples. Of the ten sub-
samples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data
for testing the model, and the remaining nine subsamples are
used as training data. The cross-validation process is then
repeated ten times, with each of the ten subsamples used
exactly once as the validation data. The ten results from the
folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.
The advantage of this technique is that all observations are
used for both training and validation, and each observation
is used for validation exactly once.

The number of layers was set to be three due to limited
data. Meanwhile, ANNs with three layers are most-widely
used in civil engineering problems and are observed to per-
form quite well in general. Another important parameter of
the ANN is the number of neurons in the intermediate layer.
It should be noted that too few neurons in the intermedi-
ate layer will lead to poor training performance of an ANN
model, whereas too many neurons will lead to overfitting
of an ANN model. Another two important parameters of
an ANN model are number of epochs and batch size. The
number of epochs is the number of passes through the entire
training dataset. The batch size is the number of samples
processed before the weights of the model are updated.

To find a competent ANN model to predict explosive
spalling of concrete, anumber of ANN models were trained
and evaluated. All the ANN models were evaluated via
tenfold cross-validation. The most competent ANN model
among the trial models is the one that has 60 neurons in
the intermediate layer with a batch size of 5 and a training
epochs of 500.

3 Experimental verification
3.1 Confirmation tests

To verify the applicability and generality of the ANN model
developed in Sect. 2 for predicting explosive spalling risk
of concrete, an independent series of heating tests, which
covered a wide range of cases, were designed and conducted.

3.1.1 Concrete mix proportions

Seven concrete mixes were used in this test series, among
which include three normal strength concrete (NSC) mixes,
three high performance concrete (HPC) mixes and one ultra-
high performance concrete (UHPC) mix. The mix propor-
tions of these concrete mixtures are listed in Table 3. To
validate the capability of ANN models to consider the effect
of silica fume, fly ash, and GGBS, these supplementary
cementitious materials were used in some of the concrete
mixes. Silica fume was used in HPC1, HPC2, HPC3, and
UHPC; GGBS and fly ash were used in HPC2 and HPC3,
respectively. For HPC1, HPC2, and HPC3, the silica fume/
binder ratio was kept constant, and for HPC2 and HPC3,
the GGBS/binder ratio and fly ash/binder ratio were kept
the same. It is noted that the cement used for NSC1, NSC2,
and NSC3 is Cement CEM I 42.5 N, while for HPC1, HPC2,
HPC3, and UHPC is Cement CEM I 52.5 N. This adopted
practice is consistent with common practice in other stud-
ies. The compressive strength tests were conducted on ~@100
mm X 200 mm cylinder specimens. Three cylinder speci-
mens were prepared for each concrete mix and compres-
sive strength of each concrete mix was taken as the average
value. To assess explosive spalling risk of concrete, 100
mm X 200 mm cylinder specimens were also adopted for
heating tests.

3.1.2 Curing conditions

To study the potential influence of moisture content on
explosive spalling of concrete, two curing conditions were
adopted respectively for each concrete mix. For NSC1,
NSC2, NSC3, HPC1, HPC2, and HPC3, one group of speci-
mens were cured in air; the other group of specimens were
cured in air initially and then cured in water for 2-4 weeks
before heating tests. For UHPC, one group of specimens
were cured in air; the other group of specimens were in
air initially and then dried at 105 °C for 1 week to remove
moisture before heating tests. To measure moisture con-
tent of these concrete specimens, three 50.8 mm (2 inches)
cube specimens were cast together with the cylinder speci-
mens for each concrete mix under two curing conditions,

respectively. The moisture content of each concrete cube
specimen is calculated as the mass difference of the speci-
men before and after drying at 105 °C to constant mass
divided by the initial mass of the specimen. The initial
masses of the cube specimens were measured on the heating
test day. The moisture content of each concrete mix under
each curing condition was taken as the average of the three
measured values.

3.1.3 Heating conditions

Two heating conditions were adopted respectively for each
concrete mix under different curing conditions. The heat-
ing rate for each heating condition was respectively 1 °C/
min and 5 °C/min. The target temperature for each heating
condition was the same, 600 °C. After reaching the target
temperature, the temperature was maintained for one hour
for both heating conditions.

3.1.4 Summary of heating tests

To summarize from Sects. 3.1.1 to 3.1.3, there were seven
concrete mixes in total. For each concrete mix, there were
two curing conditions. For each concrete mix under each
curing conditions, there were two heating conditions. So in
total there are 7 xX 2 x 2 (28) cases to be examined.

Table 4 summarizes all the 28 testing cases. For each
case, three ®100 mm x 200 mm cylinder specimens were
prepared to consider randomness of explosive spalling.

3.2 Experimental results and model verification

All the heating tests for the 28 cases were conducted at least
three months later. After heating and cooling down, photos
of the heated samples were taken. Figure 8 in “Appendix 2”
shows the states of concrete samples after heating for all the
28 cases. From the spalling test results, it can be seen that

explosive spalling of concrete is a stochastic phenomenon.
For concrete of the same mix under the same curing condi-
tion and heating regime (Case 7, 9, 21, 24, 26, and 27), not
all three samples appear spalling. This is expected and in
accordance of previous studies. Furthermore, moisture con-
tent played an obvious role in determining explosive spalling
resistance of some concrete mixes, for example, Case 8 and
22, Case 10 and 24, Case 12 and 26, Case 13 and 27; and
heating rate also played an obvious role in determining
explosive spalling resistance of some concrete mixes, for
example, Case 15 and 22, Case 16 and 23, Case 17 and 24,
Case 19 and 26, Case 20 and 27.

As mentioned in Sect. 2, as long as one sample out of
three samples spalls in a condition, then this concrete mix
is considered to be vulnerable to explosive spalling in that
condition.

the developed ANN model to get predicted results. Table 6
summarizes the test results and predicted results regarding
whether explosive spalling occurred in concrete or not. It can
be seen that the ANN model predicted the spalling results
well in general. In all of the 28 predictions, 25 predictions
are correct, which indicates a total accuracy of 82.1%.

To be more specific, under a heating rate of 1 °C/min, the
prediction accuracy of the ANN model is 100%; however,
under the heating rate of 5 °C/min, the prediction accuracy
of the ANN model is 64.3%. The large prediction error
results from incapability of the ANN model to differenti-
ate the impact of moisture content on explosive spalling of
concrete (NSC1, NSC3, HPC1, HPC2, and HPC3) at 5 °C/
min. For example, the test results for NSC1 with moisture
content of 3.1% and 5.1% were different, while the predicted
results for them are the same. This also holds true for NSC3,
HPC1, HPC2, and HPC3. This is due to the limitation of the

collected dataset. Figure 5a, b show the frequency histo-
grams of heating rate and moisture content in the collected
dataset used for training, with the vertical columns repre-
senting how many data samples there are within a heating
rate or moisture content range. Obviously, the heating rate
and moisture content in the dataset is far from uniformly
distributed. This is especially so for heating rate. Figure 6
shows a scatter plot of the training data between heating
rate and moisture content, of which only the data points that
have a heating rate less than 10 °C/min is shown. The upper
bound and lower bound of the concrete specimens (NSC1,
NSC3, HPC1, HPC2, and HPC3) for validation tests, which
are respectively 2.8% and 5.7%, are also annotated in Fig. 6.
It is noted that at a heating rate of about 5 °C/min and mois-
ture content between 2.8% and 5.7%, concrete samples in the
training dataset hardly maintained intact after thermal load-
ing. This explains why the developed ANN model fails to
take into account the effect of moisture content on explosive
spalling of concrete well.

Among all the wrong predictions, the cases that the test
showed spalling, but the ANN model outputs no spalling are
none; therefore, all the wrong predictions are the cases that
the test did not show spalling, but the ANN model outputs
spalling. So the current developed model is conservative in
estimating explosive spalling tendency of concrete. This is
preferable in design practice, as it is better to be conservative
than aggressive for safety reasons, though the ideal target of
a model is to achieve perfect prediction accuracy.

4 Discussions

The developed ANN model achieved a prediction accuracy
of 82.1%, based on a limited number of test data conducted
by different researchers. This shows that the model is toler-
ant of systematic errors and random errors in the tests done
by different researchers. Furthermore, performance of the
ANN model is closely related to the size of the dataset. The
more data the ANN model learns, the better performance the

Table 7 Predicted results on

Page9of25 134

model tends to have. Therefore, as more and more explosive
spalling evaluation tests are conducted, there will still be
room for the ANN model to improve.

4.1 Effect of moisture content

There are more than 265 test results on explosive spalling
resistance of concrete; however, many of them did not record
the moisture content of the concrete specimens at the day of
testing. To gain insight into the effect of moisture content on
ANN model, this paper collected more data on heating tests
on concrete without moisture content information [32-57].
The test results from these published literature were com-
piled and summarized in “Table 10 Appendix 3”. In total,
there are 510 test results including the 265 test results in
“Table 9 Appendix 1”. A new ANN model (named as ANN
II model) was built with 10 input parameters. ANN II model
has the same input parameters as the ANN model built in
Sect. 2 (hereafter referred to as ANN I model) except that
moisture content was not taken as one of the input parame-
ters. Following a similar procedure as Sect. 2.3, a competent
ANN II model was found to be the one that has 70 neurons in
the intermediate layer with a batch size of five and training
epochs of 900. Table 7 summarizes predicted results of ANN
II model regarding whether explosive spalling occurred in
concrete or not. In all of the 28 predictions, 20 predictions
are correct, which indicates a total accuracy of 71.4%. As
expected, ANN II model is not able to consider the effect of
moisture content on explosive spalling resistance of concrete
at all. In addition, though with more data for training, ANN
II model showed a worse prediction performance than ANN
I model. So it is highly recommended to record moisture
content of concrete in the future explosive spalling evalua-
tion tests on concrete.

4.2 Decision tree models

Decision tree algorithm is another popular machine learn-
ing method in addition to ANN, which has an inverted tree-
like structure connected by nodes. There are essentially two
types nodes in a decision tree, 1.e., decision nodes and leaf
nodes. The decision nodes are the nodes which make deci-
sions by establishing rules to divide dataset into sub-data-
sets. The leaf nodes are the nodes which provide class labels
for sub-datasets, 1.e., no more split in dataset. A decision tree
starts from a decision node at the top (commonly referred to
as root node) and grows in a manner by splitting into child
nodes. The child nodes can be decision nodes, or leaf nodes,
or a combination of both. Further technical details regarding
decision tree algorithm, specialized book can be referred to.

Two decision tree models were built here similarly
to ANN models, with DT I model having the same input
parameters as ANN I and DT II model having the same input
parameters as ANN II. Hence, the difference between DT I
and DT II is again whether they consider the effect of mois-
ture content of concrete. The training datasets for ANN I and
ANN II were adopted respectively for DT I and DT I. The
maximum depth of a decision tree, the minimum number
of samples required to be at a leaf node, and the function to
measure the quality of a split are three important parameters
of a decision tree. The maximum depth of a decision tree is
the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
node down to the farthest leaf node. A greedy trial-and-
error method was used to determine these three parameters.
A competent DT I model among the trial models is the one
that has a maximum depth of seven, a minimum number of
five samples at leaf nodes, and Gini impurity criterion; a

DT II model regarding whether explosive spalling occurred
in the 28 groups of confirmation tests or not. For DT I
model, among all of the 28 predictions, 18 predictions are
correct, which indicates a total accuracy of 62.3%; for DT
II model, among all of the 28 predictions, 22 predictions are
correct, which indicates a total accuracy of 78.6%. It is noted
that, contrary to ANN models, DT I model which considers
the effect of moisture content of concrete has a lower predic-
tion accuracy than DT II model which does not.

Figure 7 compares the prediction outcomes of ANN I,
ANN II, DT I, and DT II. ANN I model predicted 23 cases
correctly and five cases wrongly, surpassing all the rest three
models. DT I model predicted 18 cases correctly and ten
cases wrongly, being the worst-performing model. Among
the incorrect predicted cases, there are two types, here
named as type A and Type B, respectively. Type A refers to
the cases which explosive spalling occurred in test but not in
model, and type B refers to the cases that explosive spalling
did not occur in test but occurred in model. It is noted that
DT II had six type A incorrect cases, while ANN I showed
none. This means that ANN I model is conservative, while
DT II model is unconservative, 1.e., margin of safety of DT
II is considerably lower than ANN I. From a safe design per-
spective, though DT II model has a prediction accuracy of
78.6%, which is only slightly lower than that of ANN I, the
prediction outcomes of DT II model are unsatisfactory. The
relatively poor performance of decision tree models is likely
due to the possible imbalance existing in the current training
dataset, which greatly affects performance of decision trees.

5 Conclusions

Predicting explosive spalling of concrete is a challenging
problem to be solved. This study applied artificial neural
network and decision tree techniques to predict explosive
spalling risk of concrete based on concrete mix propor-
tions. The following conclusions and recommendations are
obtained from this study:

(a) The proposed ANN model (ANN JI) predicted well
explosive spalling of concrete, with an accuracy
of 82.1%. Artificial neural network is a promising
method to assess explosive spalling risk of concrete.
As more test data becomes available, the ANN model
is expected to perform better.

(b) The ANN I model is not able to take into account the
effect of moisture content on explosive spalling resist-
ance of concrete well at 5 °C/min. The relatively bad
performance of the model results from lack of data in
that range of moisture content at 5 °C/min. This is not
essentially a weakness of the ANN model, but shortage
of the test data. There is not sufficient data for the ANN
model to learn and make a good judgment at that range
of moisture content at 5 °C/min.

(c) The ANN II model which did not take moisture con-
tent as one of the input parameters had a larger predic-

Pagellof25 134

tion error than the ANN I model which did, though
the ANN II model is developed based on a larger size
of data set. Therefore, it is important to include mois-
ture content as one of the input parameters in the ANN
model.

(d) ANN models predicted explosive spalling of concrete
better than decision tree models with the currently
available dataset.

(e) Though ANN I model was trained based on a limited
number of test data from a wide range of test condi-
tions, the performance of the ANN model was good.
It indicates the ANN model is tolerant to systematic
errors and random errors in the tests conducted under
different conditions.

(f) It is recommended to record moisture content of con-
crete when conducting explosive spalling evaluation
tests so that the test results can be used to further
improve the performance of ANN model in assessing
explosive spalling.

(g) Current generation of ANN model is not able to predict
explosive spalling of fiber-reinforced concrete. Future
efforts are necessary to extend the ANN model to con-
sider the effect of steel fibers and polypropylene fibers,
which are commonly used in fiber-reinforced concrete.
