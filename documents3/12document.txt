Abstract

In a real network deployment, the diverse sensor applications generate a heterogeneous traffic pattern which may
include basic sensing measurements such as temperature readings or high-volume multimedia traffic. In a
heterogeneous traffic network, the two standardized objective functions (OFs), i.e., objective function zero (OFO)
and the Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF) for routing protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
Networks (RPL) perform poor routing decisions by selecting an already congested parent node and cause more re-
transmissions across the network. Therefore, careful consideration is required in designing a new OF for
heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this study, we examine the RPL protocol under a heterogeneous traffic pattern
and proposed a new protocol based on queue and workload-based condition (QWL-RPL). The aim of the proposed
protocol is to achieve a reliable path with better overall performance. The proposed OF model considers the link
workload in addition to mapping the congestion status of the node using the packet queue. We implement the
proposed routing model in the Contiki operating system (OS) Cooja environment to compare with the existing
technique. The simulation results show that QWL-RPL can improve the performance of a heterogeneous traffic
network as compared with both OFO and MRHOF, specifically in terms of the amount of overhead, packets
reception ratio (PRR), average delay, and jitter. Final results indicate that on average, there is a 5%-30%
improvement in PRR, 25%-45% reduction in overheads, 12%-30% reduction in average delay, and 20%-40%

reduction in jitter.

1 Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a large system of intercon-
nected heterogeneous devices to sense our physical envir-
onment and communicate the sensed information. Each
sensor detects its vicinity and transmits the sensed informa-
tion to the sink node via its neighboring nodes using multi-
hop communication [1]. The practical applications of such
a system include smart cities [2] [3], industrial and building
automation, disaster management [4], smart grid, and
smart healthcare [5]. A sensor discovers its neighbors,
builds the topology, and routes the sensed data. An IoT sys-
tem requires an efficient networking mechanism to facili-
tate such an interconnected heterogeneous flow of traffic.
An efficient routing mechanism must consider these device
characteristics and constrained resources. Furthermore, the

IoT sensors usually face unfavorable environmental factors.
Thus, designing of such routing protocols is a complicated
task due to the resource limitations of these devices, such
as limited energy, limited memory, and limited processing
power [6]. For any pair of communicating nodes, a reason-
able goal for such a protocol is to improve communication
performance while maintaining energy consumption at a
minimum level. However, achieving this goal requires care-
ful consideration of the lossy nature of the network, fluctu-
ating traffic patterns, varying link qualities, routing loops,
and convergence time [7].

Several routing protocols have been proposed for these
Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN) devices; these in-
clude protocols such as Tiny ad hoc on-demand distance
vector (TinyAODV) [8], hierarchical routing over 6LoW-
PAN (hilow) [9], 6LoWPAN ad hoc on-demand distance
vector routing (LOAD) [10], dynamic MANET on-
demand for 6LoWPAN (DYMO-low) [11], collection tree
protocol (CTP) [12], and hybrid routing protocol for lossy

and low power networks (Hydro) [13]. One of the promis-
ing routing protocols that provides IPv6 connectivity to
the LLN devices is called the routing protocol for Low-
Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), as proposed by the
International Engineering Task Force (IETF), ROLL
(Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy Networks) working
group [14]. The RPL protocol is based on the IPv6 low-
power wireless personal area network (6LOWPAN) which
is connected to the IP network through the sink node
(Fig. 1) [15]. The RPL protocol has been proposed for a
wide range of networking environments such as home
automation, building automation, industrial automation,
urban routing, and the smart grid [16] [17]. The RPL is
being utilized commercially by Cisco for the field area net-
work (FAN) and smart grids (CG-Mesh) to enable the ad-
vanced meter infrastructure (AMI) [18].

The RPL protocol is a distance vector proactive rout-
ing protocol that creates a tree-like routing topology
called the destination-oriented directed acyclic graph
(DODAG), rooted towards one or more nodes called the
root node or sink node. The directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) are created based on a user-specified specific
objective function (OF). The OF defines the method to
find the best-optimized route among the number of sen-
sor devices [14]. The IETF ROLL working group stan-
dardized the objective function zero (OFO) [19] and the
minimum rank with hysteresis objective function
(MRHOF) as default routing metrics defined in RFC
6719 [20]. The OFO finds the shortest path to the sink
node by selecting the candidate parent node with

minimum rank in terms of the distance from the sink
(i.e., its position in the routing tree). The MRHOF finds
the routes through the sensor nodes that minimize the
link cost associated with the routes. It selects the new
routing path if the cost associated with it is less than the
current path cost by a given threshold value. This is
known as ‘hysteresis.’ As prescribed in the standard,
MRHOF utilizes the expected transmission count (ETX)
metric which calculates the link quality. Furthermore,
ETX considers link-layer congestion but does not reflect
node level congestion. Therefore, selecting a routing
path based on the smallest hop count and link quality in
a heterogeneous traffic environment does not lead to an
efficient load-balancing solution. The nodes closer to the
sink node suffer from packet loss due to a high relay
burden in a dense networking environment. The chosen
parent node in RPL can have multiple child nodes; con-
sequently, the overloaded preferred parent becomes
prone to failure because its energy drains much faster
than other nodes. The inefficient OFs lead to building a
routing topology that experiences an excessively unbal-
anced load and energy distribution, particularly for those
nodes that are closest to the sink node.

The diverse applications of LLNs include scenarios ran-
ging from basic temperature measurements to high-volume
multimedia services that require efficient communication
support. The LLN heterogeneous traffic environment suf-
fers from severe congestion and packet loss by not utilizing
the full network capacity. A high relay burden, unbalanced
load, and limited resources eventually lead to node failure.
The ETX-based node broadcasts probe packets at time in-
tervals to assess the link quality. The receiving node re-
broadcasts the probe packet which further increases the
network congestion. If there is a node failure, RPL initiates
two types of repairs: local repair and global repair. In the
local repair scenario, a child node routes the packets
through its sibling node or the child node switches to the
parent node. The global repair is initiated by a gateway or
sink node. In both cases, the network incurs overall delay
and additional control overhead, which, in turn, becomes a
detriment to the overall network performance. When the
number of failed nodes increases significantly, the network
is split in such a way that communicating with the sink
node is not possible through any path, resulting in a non-
operational network [14, 20].

The generic definition of heterogeneity is a lack of uni-
formity. In terms of heterogeneous traffic load, some of
the nodes are traffic-intensive while others generate traf-
fic with a low traffic rate. In a normal scenario, the sen-
sor nodes form a tree topology to transfer data towards
the root node. The traffic flow is homogeneous with a
constant period. In this case, the resulting traffic pattern
is predictable and load imbalance is unlikely. In the het-
erogeneous case, the transmission interval, as well as
Musaddigq et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

transmission load, differ in each node; thus, the load
fluctuates unpredictably causing a significant load imbal-
ance problem.

In a heterogeneous traffic load scenario, the load im-
balance may not be due to the subtree size, as illustrated
in Fig. 2, where node 5 has a choice to select the node 2
or node 3 as its parent node. As node 3 contain only
one child node, node 5 is likely to select node 3 as its
parent node. This scenario is likely to happen in the
same traffic load case. However, in this network, the ac-
cumulated workload at node 3 is greater than that of
node 2 due to the high packet generation rate of node 6,
i.e, 60ppm (packets per minute). Therefore, having
more nodes in the routing subtree does not always mean
that more traffic flows through that node in a heteroge-
neous traffic network. In [20], it is observed that parent
nodes with large subtree sizes have large queue losses.
However, in a heterogeneous traffic pattern, it may not
always be true that a parent node with large subtree will
have large queue losses. In heterogeneous traffic, the im-
balanced loads and queue losses are primarily due to the
unbalanced traffic generation as compared with an un-
balanced subtree size. The ETX primarily reflects the
link-level losses rather than node-level packet losses. On
the contrary, the hop count only reflects the number of
hops irrespective of traffic load and queue losses. In the
same way, utilizing only the queue size as a decision
metric does not truly reflect the load condition. The
workload of each node is an important parameter in an
uneven traffic load pattern. Similarly, the protocol design
for such cases must consider latency or average end-to-
end (E2E) delay and the amount of overhead as an im-
portant performance parameter. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to consider a new routing metric that solves the
load balancing problem in a heterogeneous traffic load
scenario.

Various routing metrics have been proposed for homo-
geneous traffic loads; these metrics are based on node and
link-level attributes such as node residual energy [21],
queue utilization [22], throughput, and latency for parent
selection in a heterogeneous network. These routing met-
rics are explained in Section 2. The main contributions of
our work are to fill the gap in the proposed OFs and pro-
vide a mechanism that achieves an improved packet re-
ception ratio (PRR), average E2E packet delay, jitter,
overall load balancing, and enhanced network lifetime
while conforming to the RPL standard. To handle this
issue, we propose an OF for a heterogeneous traffic load
based on queue and workload (QWL-RPL) that provides
an extension to the RPL. The proposed metric considers
the load and congestion during uneven traffic distribution
to make the best decision for route selection.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 presents the related work and Section 3 dis-
cusses the QWL-RPL implementation and analysis. Sec-
tion 4 describes the simulation method and experiment.
The experimental results and analysis are presented in
Section 5. Finally, the conclusion and future work are
discussed in Section 6.

The RPL is standardized for LLNs as a proactive routing
protocol that operates on top of the 802.15.4 physical
(PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers (Fig. 3)
[23-25]. As the sensor nodes are small and usually con-
tain a limited battery as an energy source, the network
protocol stack of the sensor motes often includes a radio
duty cycling (RDC) protocol such as NullRDC, Contiki-
MAC [26], and X-MAC [27]. NullRDC does not use
framer functions and transmit/receive the data directly
to the physical layer. ContikiMAC uses periodical wake-
ups to listen for packet transmissions from neighbors
whereas X-MAC protocol does not switch off its radio
after packet transmission. These RDC protocols are all

implemented in the Contiki OS Cooja simulator [28].
The RDC protocol can increase energy efficiency by si-
lencing the radio when there is no sensing activity. RPL
uses a specific OF that defines the use of specific metrics
for rank calculation to make an intelligent routing deci-
sion. It constructs a tree-like routing topology called
DODAG. The primary objectives of the RPL protocol
are to create an optimal DODAG and to adapt the top-
ology with respect to various network situations. To
manage various routing challenges, the routing metrics
must consider different constraints and requirements of
the LLN network. The RPL protocol does not specify
any particular OF or routing metric to be used. Rather,
it provides a great degree of flexibly for defining any OF
based on network applications and design. In recent
years, RPL has been studied in different contexts and for
a variety of platforms; several protocols are presented to
study the variations of RPL protocol. Various analyses
are performed to critically analyze the reliability and per-
formance of RPL variations. Traditionally, ETX in
MRHOF and hop count in OFO are provided by the RPL
standard implementation. The OFO implementation does
not use any specific routing metric for rank calculation
other than hop count. MRHOF accesses the link quality
between the nodes to select the preferred parent node.
This approach is more efficient and is favored in RPL
models [19, 20].

The routing protocols discussed in this literature are
primarily focused on increasing the network performance
in terms of load balancing, congestion, and energy con-
sumption. These protocols employ various routing metrics
and scenarios to improve the network performance
through the routing protocol. The authors in [22] present
a queue-utilization-based RPL (QU-RPL) that evaluates
the end-to-end delivery performance. This method bal-
ances the routing tree under heavy traffic scenarios. The
proposed mechanism discusses the congestion and load
balancing issue by considering the queue utilization factor
in node selection. The queue utilization factor reflects the
congestion state of the node during parent selection. The
node chooses the parent that has less buffer occupancy
and lower hop counts from the sink node. Bhandari et al.
propose a congestion-aware routing protocol (CoAR) [29]
that uses a multi-criteria decision-making approach.

(2020) 2020:21 Page 4 of 23

CoAR utilizes the order preference by similarity to ideal
solution (TOPSIS) [30] and combines multiple routing
metrics for parent selection. The proposed OF is based on
the queue utilization, ETX, remaining energy, and neigh-
borhood index. The neighborhood index defines the ratio
of the number of downstream neighbors to the total num-
ber of neighboring nodes.

Tang et al. also discuss the congestion avoidance
mechanism and proposed a composite metric called CA-
RPL [31]. The CA-RPL determines the average delay to-
wards the sink node and computes the weight of each
path. It also includes the rank of the node, ETX value,
and the number of received packets. Taghizadeh et al.
[32] propose a metric for the energy and packet loss
problem under heavy traffic load scenarios. The rank of
the node is computed based on the context of the node.
The authors in [33] propose two MAC-aware routing
metrics called R-metric and Q-metric. The R-metric en-
hances the ETX protocol by considering the packet
drops due to MAC contention, and the Q-metric solves
the load balancing problem by considering the power
consumption during transmission and reception of the
packets. Sanmartin et al. propose SIGMA-ETX [34]
which considers the standard deviation of ETX values
between each node. This protocol provides efficient per-
formance in a dense network.

Another metric to achieve load balancing is named
ETT-LB [35] which considers the transmission rate and
size of the packet in addition to the expected delay time.
Similarly, the authors in [36] proposed another load balan-
cing technique called ALABAMO, which considers the
node selection using both the ETX and the traffic load
profiles of the nodes. Liu et al. also proposed an interest-
ing load balancing mechanism based on the RPL protocol
called LB-RPL [37]. It considers the workload differences
and spreads the data traffic among multiple parent nodes.
It leverages the concept of multiparent routing and utilizes
all the potential parent nodes for next hop data forward-
ing. The data is distributed proportionally according to
the measured link quality status.

The multipath routing approach is utilized to provide
load balancing [38], reliability [39], and fault-tolerance
[40]. Iova et al. propose a multi-parent protocol and pre-
sents the expected lifetime (ELT) [41] metric to estimate

the lifetime of the bottlenecked nodes. The proposed
ELT metric considers the amount of traffic and link reli-
ability to estimate the energy hotspots. Another energy-
based routing metric for RPL is defined in [42] that uses
the remaining energy as a main decision parameter for
the next hop selection.

Zhao et al. define a region-based energy-efficient rout-
ing protocol called ER-RPL [43]. In ER-RPL, only a sub-
set of the nodes participates in the route discovery
which results in the reduction of the control overheads.
Natanael et al. [44] also propose an energy-efficient and
path-reliability-aware objective function (ERAOF) that
also includes energy consumption as a routing metric to
avoid the low-energy paths. Barbato et al. propose the
resource-oriented and energy-efficient routing (ROEE)
RPL protocol [45]. The ROEE RPL protocol retrieves re-
source information requested by the application layer
and defines the routing path based on the resource re-
quirements of the network. The proposed metric uses
the energy consumption and battery index of each node.

In a similar way, the scalable context-aware objective
function (SCAOF) [46] has been proposed which utilizes
the weighted sum of three metrics, i.e., degree of node
connectivity, node energy, and node location in the
DODAG relative to the parent node. The diverse appli-
cations of IoT networks require numerous performance
parameters. Thus, the authors in [47] combine multiple
routing metrics which are the point-to-point delay, ETX,
hop count, and battery energy level. Using these metrics,
the proposed objective function is based on fuzzy logic.

Patrick et al. [48] also utilize the concept of fuzzy logic
to combine several routing metrics that include ETX,
delay, and energy cost of the path. Regarding multiple
metrics, Walid et al. propose a new OF which is based
on the non-linear length (NL-OF) [49]. The NL-OF is a
greedy approach that considers any number of metrics
and all input constraints for quality of service (QoS).

The authors in [50] use the residual energy depletion
rate for the routing decision. Elnaz et al. [51] formulated
a transmission power control technique to reduce power
consumption and Barbato et al. [52] exploit the node en-
ergy status and the node’s position in the network.
Brachman et al. [53] provide the analysis of the OFO and
link quality OF (LLQ OF). The OFO minimizes the hop
count while LLQ OF uses link quality metric derived
from the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value
to maintain the network stability. The bio-inspired par-
ticle multi-swarm optimization (PMSO) routing algo-
rithm for multipath selection is proposed in [54]. PMSO
achieves fast recovery from path failure by utilizing aver-
age energy consumption and average in-network delay
as a routing objective function.

The optimization model proposed in [55] aims to re-
duce the expected end-to-end transmission time. The
proposed method determines the weighted cumulative
expected transmission time (WCETT) which depends
on the number of links in the network. It then utilizes
the optimization model to reduce the sum of all
WCETTs while considering the bandwidth, flow control,
and power control constraints.

3 QWL-RPL implementation and analysis

This section describes the QWL-RPL protocol which con-
siders the load imbalance problem during a heterogeneous
traffic scenario. We consider a network with two different
types of traffic heterogeneities. The first scenario contains
a network where nodes transmit with a fixed heteroge-
neous traffic pattern; the second scenario involves traffic
generation randomness that varies with time.

3.1 System model
Consider an LLN IoT scenario forming an RPL routing

topology. The network comprises a multihop network

for data transmission from a child node to the root
node, forming a DODAG routing graph. The network
consists of a number of nodes N which are ranked in in-
creasing order from the root node. The node model in-
cludes the Texas Instruments CC2420 radio transceiver.
Based on their rank, these nodes are divided into sets of
parent and child nodes N = P U C, where P represents
the set of parent nodes (pj, po, Pz)... » Py) and C repre-
sents the set of child nodes (c, C9, C3, ...., C,). The candi-
date parent node is given a rank one if it is a root node.
The sink node connects the LLN nodes to the IPv6 net-
work forming a wide area network (WAN). Each node

utilizes IEEE 802.15.4 links for communication, carrier
sense multiple-access (CSMA) for the MAC protocol,
and ContikiMAC for asynchronous radio duty cycling
with the default sleep interval of 125ms. All nodes
transmit their packets in a discrete time-slotted manner
(¢ = 1, 2, 3...). The maximum retransmission limit for
the link layer is eight retransmission attempts. The
CC2420 radio clear channel assessment (CCA) threshold
(CC2420_CONF_CCA_THRESH) is -45 dBm.

The nodes are stationary and utilize the Zolertia Z1
mote platform [56]. Zl mote provides new features
such as maximum efficiency and robustness with low
energy cost. It also provides a bigger ROM size (96 KB)
as compared with other motes such as TMote Sky that
provide ROM of size 48 KB. The Z1 devices also have
one of the lowest payload sizes, ie., 140 bytes. The
TMote Sky payload size is 240 bytes. Thus, it is a good
platform to fit typical sensor messages into a single IP
packet of the uIP stack. The Z1 mote is ported to the
Contiki OS (platform/z1) in a simulation environment.
This mote also uses the MSP430F2617 low power

microcontroller, with 8KB RAM and a 92KB flash
memory and runs the IEEE 802.15.4-compliant CC2420
transceiver. Each node transmits a packet size of 127
bytes and the buffer occupancy (Queue_Conf_Num) of
each node is 4 packets. The maximum payload size
supported by the uIP stack (UIP_CONF_BUFFER_
SIZE) is set to 140, which means any IP packet with
size more than 140 will be dropped.

3.2 The ConikiRPL implementation and analysis with OFO
and MRHOF
This sub-section describes the experimental simulation sce-
narios with the default OFO and MRHOF objective func-
tions. The network is running with default objective
functions to choose the best routing path. In the conti-
kiRPL implementation, choosing either OFO or MRHOF
requires the setting of various parameters. These parameter
settings and their associated files are shown in Table 1.

For OFO, Cooja uses a rank with a minimum of 256
units (min_hoprankinc) that allows a maximum of 255
hops, and for MRHOF, Cooja uses a rank (min_

hoprankinc) with a minimum unit of 128. The ETX
metric (parent_link_metric(p)) starts with a unit of 256
with a fixed-point divisor of 128 (LINK_STATS_ETX_
DEVISOR). The ETX value increases or decreases ac-
cording to the MAC layer retransmission attempts. ETX
is the expected number of transmissions required to
transmit a packet successfully. ETX primarily reflects the
packet loss by considering the quality of the wireless
channel and packet collisions. In other words, a lower
ETX means that the node is attempting to send a packet
successfully in a few attempts and is therefore also con-
suming less energy. The ETX metric does not reflect the
delay; if the packet is transmitted successfully, the delay
metric is not affected.

ETX also depends on the distance between two nodes
because the probabilities of successful transmission de-
crease with the increase of distance. ETX can also be es-
timated based on the RSSI value (guess_etx_from_rssi).
ETX can be reduced by increasing the transmission
power of the nodes but this also increases the interfer-
ence range in the wireless medium. ETX can be repre-
sented as follows:

1

ETX = —-——
Df x Dr

(1)

where Df indicates the probability of packets being re-
ceived by the neighboring node and Dr is the probability
that the acknowledgment is received successfully. In the
Contiki OS, ETX is based on the callbacks from the COMA
protocols which provides information on how many at-
tempts were required in transmitting a packet. RPL uses an
exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) filter to
smooth the ETX over time (EWMA_ALPHA).

For a scenario of 20 nodes with a traffic generation rate
of 1, 10, 30, 60 packets per minute (ppm), the results with
OFO and MRHOF with the ETX metric are depicted in
Table 2. With an unbalanced traffic load, the PRR of OFO
is 78.84 percent and the overheads are 60472 units. The
MRHOF increased the network efficiency in terms of the
performance metrics mentioned in Table 2, but still pro-
duced 17007 overheads. In a scenario of many networks
with an unbalanced traffic generation rate of each node,
the performance would worsen further. The sensor node
with better link quality forwards more packets and, in the
Musaddiq et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

case of uneven data traffic, this results in significant load
imbalance. The energy depletion rate will also be greater,
thus causing holes in the network.

3.3 QWL-RPL algorithm implementation and analysis

The QWL-RPL algorithm considers the load imbalance
problem during a heterogeneous traffic scenario. As we
have observed in the previous sub-section, the OFO and
ETX-based MRHOF is not suitable for solving the load
imbalance problem caused by traffic heterogeneity. Thus,
using a subtree size in the routing table for load balancing
might not be suitable in varying traffic load conditions.
For this type of scenario, we are utilizing the periodic

workload information along with the queue status of each
node. The queue of each node can hold up to 4 packets at
a time due to the smaller memory size of the Z1 mote.
This amount of data is considerably smaller compared
with the workload information. The workload of each
node consists of the self-load and the load due to the sub-
tree (the child nodes). The number of transmissions of
each node every 10s describes the workload information.
In this work, the node workload is obtained based on the
number of total packets it has transmitted in the last 10-s
duration, which includes the packets it received from the
subtree nodes and the number of the packets generated
by the parent node itself. The workload calculation is de-
scribed in Algorithm 1. The weighted queue information
is utilized along with the workload parameter.

Rank = Rank(p) + @Qyup_ten + WLmactx (2)

where Rank(p) is the parent node rank, Qbur_ ten is the
number of packets in the packet queue buffer, and
WLImactx is the number of transmitted packets at the MAC
layer during the last time period. As explained previously,

the ETX-based node broadcasts probe packets at each inter-
val to assess the link quality, and the receiving node re-
broadcasts this probe packet, which further increases the
network congestion as well as delay. To alleviate the large
amount of overhead and increase the average delay, we did
not utilize the ETX metric in the proposed mechanism. The
a is a positive integer that is used as a weighting factor in
our experiment to enhance the impact of a small queue size
for the routing decision. The value of the weighting factor a
is calculated empirically. According to the empirical results
obtained in the simulation experiment, the optimal weight-
ing factor is 90. At this value, the PRR is higher and the
average delay is less. The average delay is the key parameter

Table 6 Illustrating number of DIS messages for scenario |

in a heterogeneous network where some of the nodes might
transmit voice/video packets. Figure 4 depicts the PRR in
percentage and average delay against the varying weighting
factor. The weighting factor is an important parameter that
affects the network performance. Our empirical results
show that, at a=90, the proposed protocol provides the
highest PRR and lower average delay.

In the Contiki OS Cooja simulator, the metric container
(MC) of ETX is defined while the MC of energy is also
present as a stub. We can either develop our own MC or
we can utilize the already available MC. In either of the
cases, we need to update the rank information to the child
nodes. The transmission of the DIO message follows the

trickle mechanism. The LLN nodes have limited computa-
tional capability and a limited energy source. Thus, keeping
the transmission of overhead packets at a minimum is an
essential part of RPL network. To achieve this goal, RPL uti-
lizes a mechanism called the trickle timer [57]. The trickle
timer is used to schedule the control messages and service
discovery. The DIO packets are transmitted more frequently
if the network is not stable or a new node enters the net-
work to update the DODAG faster [58-60].

After receiving the DIO message, each node generates
the list of candidate parent nodes. During the selection
procedure, the parent node with the minimum rank
value is selected. The simulation results are presented in
the next section. The rank calculation is shown in Algo-
rithm 2. In RPL, the rank of the node is based on its par-
ent rank and base rank. The default value of base rank is
128. If the node has no parent and the base rank is zero,
then the rank is infinite. If the base rank is not zero, the
rank is the base rank plus the rank increase. The rank
increase is calculated according to the OF which is based
on the queue and workload parameters in our case. The
child node contains the list of candidate parent node
ranks, compares the two or more parents, and returns
the minimum ranked parent node.

4 Simulation method and experiment

In this section, we perform the simulation study of the
proposed mechanism. The Contiki OS is used to test
RPL in the simulation environment. The performance of
the proposed mechanism is evaluated in a network car-
rying heterogeneous traffic. The analysis is first
Musaddiq et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

performed on a fixed heterogeneous traffic pattern; then
the network is evaluated with a varying traffic pattern.
Both types of traffic environments are compared with
two other OFs, i.e., OFO and MRHOF. The performance
of these three OFs is evaluated in terms of PRR, packet
loss ratio (PLR), average delay, jitter, number of control
overheads, convergence time, and energy consumption.
The performance is evaluated for five different network
sizes. These network sizes consider the topology of 20,
30, 40, 50, and 100 nodes with one sink node in each
network. All nodes send packets to the one sink node.
The simulations are repeated a number of times. The
simulation parameters are shown in Table 3.

Figure 5 shows the routing topology with a varying
number of nodes. Each node is a Z1 Zolertia node, and
the colors of nodes represent the different traffic pat-
terns. The sending interval of the nodes varies with re-
spect to the clock second; for example, one packet *
clock second means a node transmits one packet after
every 1s (i.e., 60 ppm); two packets * clock second shows
a node is transmitting one packet every 2s (i.e., 30 ppm);
six packets * clock second describes a transmission rate

Overheads (%)

(2020) 2020:21 Page 14 of 23

of one packet every 6s (ie., 10 ppm); similarly a pattern
of 60 packets * clock second defines a node transmission
rate of one packet every 60s (ie., 1 ppm). In this sce-
nario, the first simulation is performed with 20 clients
(senders) nodes as depicted in Fig. 5a using OFO,
MRHOF, and QWL-RPL. Similarly, network scenarios
with 30 nodes, 40 nodes, 50 nodes, and 100 nodes are
depicted in Fig. 5b, c, d, and e, respectively. There is one
sink node (node one) and all the OFs use similar net-
work configurations.

Figure 6 shows scenario II of the same network
configuration except all the client’s nodes are generat-
ing traffic randomly. The packet generation is based
on a random number of 1-15 * clock second/random
1-10. The random number seeds are generated with
respect to clock time (clock_time()) each iteration.
For scenario I, Fig. 6a shows a topology with 20
nodes, and Fig. 6b, c, d, and e show topologies with
30, 40, 50, and 100 nodes, respectively, generating
network traffic randomly. To calculate the energy
consumption, we have utilized the Energest module
in the Contiki OS.

5 Experimental results and analysis
This section provides an analysis of the results of the
simulations. We used Python 3.7 to analyze the raw data
obtained from the Cooja simulator. We studied the be-
havior of these protocols using two heterogeneous traffic
scenarios and evaluated these protocols by varying the
number of deployed sensor nodes. By increasing the
number of nodes, more traffic is generated thus leading
to the congestion. We deployed networks up to 100
nodes in size to study the default and proposed proto-
cols under dense nodes and a heavy load environment.
PRR shows the percentage of the number of packets
that are successfully received at the sink node relative to
the number of packets sent from all the nodes to the
sink node. PRR is calculated with the formula PRR =
(total packets received/total packets sent) x 100. Hetero-
geneous traffic networks are a common phenomenon in
a number of IoT applications, such as industrial moni-
toring, health care [61] [62], or the smart home [63].
PRR can be better addressed with the proposed scheme
in a heterogeneous load environment. Figure 7a shows
the PRR of the OFO, MRHOF, and the QWL-RPL

(2020) 2020:21 Page 15 of 23

protocol analyzed in a fixed heterogeneous traffic net-
work scenario. Similarly, PLR (the packet loss ratio) is
depicted in Fig. 7b. The PLR is calculated with the for-
mula PLR = (100—PRR). PRR, on the other hand, shows
the performance of the protocol in terms of the percent-
age of packets successfully delivered to the sink node.
QWL and MRHOF develop more reliable networks as
compared with OFO. The reason is that OFO has no link
reliability mechanism and the routes are selected based
only on the hop counts. Although the ETX-based
MRHOF applies a probing mechanism to measure the
link quality, it still shows slightly lower PRR as com-
pared with the QWL protocol. Figure 8a and b shows a
simulation analysis of PRR and PLR for varying hetero-
geneous traffic networks (scenario II depicted in Fig. 6).
The QWL protocol congestion- and workload-aware
mechanism causes the node to route traffic on the path
with the lighter load to cause less packet loss. The RPL
protocol does not have a mechanism to detect a load im-
balance caused by the heterogeneous traffic load. The
packets are backlogged at the node having a high packet
generation by itself or by its child nodes in a short interval.

This results in congestion and packet loss. During our ex-
periment, we noticed that some of the nodes lost a large
number of packets; for example, Tables 4 and 5 demon-
strate the number of nodes having a packet delivery ratio
of less than 10% in scenario I and scenario II, respectively.
It can be seen that none of the nodes in the QWL-RPL
network have less than 10% delivery ratio while OFO has
many nodes with a low (< 10%) delivery ratio. The
MRHOF also contain such node(s) in 50- and 100-node
network size. Similarly, we also noticed that in OFO and
MRHOF there are some nodes that were unable to trans-
mit any packets, ie., their delivery ratio is 0%. For ex-
ample, with the 100-node scenario (Fig. 5e), we noticed all
the packets of node number 101 are lost in MRHOF.
Similarly, nodes 10, 27, 69, 71, 76, 79, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96,
and 101 were not able to deliver any packets to the root
node in the OFO network. The delivery ratio of these
nodes is 0%. We want to highlight that no node in the
QWL network had a delivery ratio of less than 10%.

The average end-to-end packet delivery delay (E2E) rep-
resents the average delays of all the packets in the network.
E2E delay is the time taken by a packet to travel from its

EE OF0

origin to the sink node. Figures 9a and 10a show the aver-
age E2E packet delay for all three protocols in scenario I
and scenario II, respectively. The E2E delay in OFO is
greater but is reduced by increasing the number of nodes.
The increased delay is because OFO finds the path with the
lowest hop count irrespective of congestion. In a large-size
network utilizing OFO, some of the nodes are unable to de-
liver any packet as explained previously. We measured the
delay of packets transmitted successfully to the sink node.
MRHOF shows more delay due to the continuous probing
mechanism, whereby the path with good link quality is
found using probe packets. Some of the nodes or routing
paths may be congested or overloaded, which forces
packets to be queued. Thus, both link-level and load-level
congestion result in more delays. QWL utilizes the queue
and workload information simultaneously, which helps the
node to find a less congested path efficiently.

We also evaluated the quality of service performance
metrics in terms of jitter. Jitter is a delay that varies over
time, i.e., the variation in delay. Delay represents the E2E
delay of packets; whereas, jitter is the variation of packet
arrival times and is calculated as the delay between two

consecutive packets. Average network jitter, calculated
as Jitter = (total Jitter/number of nodes), is an important
parameter in time-critical applications where each
packet must reach its destination with a delay constraint
relative to the previous packet delay. The video or image
sequential transmission requires a strict timing regularity
in delivering the stream of packets successfully to main-
tain a smooth reception of packets at the destination.
The results of jitter observed in the simulation experi-
ment are shown in Figs. 9b and 10b respectively. The jit-
ter occurs due to the congestion in the network. The
jitter was reduced in OFO when the network size reached
100 nodes. As explained in the E2E delay, some of the
nodes in OFO could not transmit any packets. The
MRHOF has more average delay due to congestion and
improper load balancing and, thus, causes more jitter.
The sensor node has a very limited capacity in terms
of energy, memory, and computational capability. Along
with the data packets, the control messages are ex-
changed in the network. The RPL incurs control over-
heads (DIO, DAO, and DIS) during the DODAG
construction. After the construction of the network, the

(2020) 2020:21 Page 17 of 23

nodes exchange the control messages to maintain the
network using the trickle timer algorithm. These over-
heads lead to higher energy consumption, congestion,
and collisions. In a stable network, fewer overheads are
exchanged to maintain the connectivity. Based on the
network condition, each node transmits DIO messages
using the trickle timer. The frequency of DIO messages
depends on network stability. Figure 1la and b depicts
the total number of DIO overheads in scenario I and
Fig. 12a and b shows the total number of DIOs and
DAOs transmitted in scenario II. The nodes use DIS
messages to probe the neighboring nodes for nearby
DODAGs. The network created using all three men-
tioned OFs has the same number of DIS messages. The
total number of DIS messages for each network size in
scenario I and scenario II are depicted in Tables 6 and 7,
respectively. The DIO messages are also related to PRR,
i.e., the network with poor PRR incurs more DIO mes-
sages. The child nodes transmit their destination infor-
mation towards the sink node via DAO messages. DAO
messages also contribute to a large number of overheads.
The DAO messages are transmitted to the sink when

the upward route is changed. DIO and DAO messages
maintain the routing topology by transmitting routing
information periodically. Their transmission frequency
decreases when the network is stable, and vice versa.
These results reflect that a large amount of energy is
wasted for routing signaling.

During the network initiation phase, all the packets in
the network are control messages. Then, after network
construction is completed, the nodes begin packet trans-
mission. The overhead percentage compared with the
total traffic in the network is shown in Figs. 13a and 14a
for scenario I and scenario II, respectively. In Fig. 13a,
the percentage of overheads in OFO is more than 65% in
all five network size scenarios. This means that a large
percentage of limited battery power is wasted in trans-
mitting and receiving the control overheads. This is be-
cause the OFO cannot resolve the congestion and load-
balancing issue, resulting in a highly unstable network.
Similarly, MRHOF has a high percentage of overhead
packets, as compared with QWL-RPL, due to the same
congestion, retransmission, and load-balancing problem.
The percentage of overheads in the QWL-RPL network
is much less than that of OFO and MRHOF; even for a
large and dense network of 100 nodes, the total percent-
age of overheads is approximately 20.68% compared with
62.61% in OFO and 41.94% in MRHOF. QWL-RPL is
able to minimize the routing overheads by considering
the node queue and workload status to route the packets
through less congested and less overloaded paths. Simi-
larly, the total number of overheads is also depicted in
Figs. 13b and 14b for scenarios I and IL, respectively.
The total number of overheads is the sum of the total
numbers of DIOs, DAOs, and DIS messages. The two
dominant control overheads contributing to the large
percentage of overheads are the DIOs and DAOs. The
DAO messages are responsible for maintaining the
downward routes. DAO overheads are different from
DIO as each DIO message is broadcast while DAO mes-
sages are forward up to the sink node. Due to high PLR
in OFO, more packets are retransmitted. The number
of hops increases with the increase of network size
and more control packets are transmitted to update
the routing table entries. The number of DIO mes-
sages in MRHOF is higher than that of QWL, due to
fluctuating link conditions, requiring more control
packets to estimate the link qualities. The collisions
due to probe packets are also one of the causes of ir-
regular ETX. We can see the significant improvement
that results from reducing the total number of control
overheads in the network. The graphs representing
QWL-RPL reflect that the network is consistent,
stable, less congested, and consumes less energy re-
sources. Thus, the QWL-RPL incurs fewer retransmis-
sions and congestion.

We also evaluated the network in terms of conver-
gence time. Convergence time is defined as the amount
of time needed for all the nodes to join the network. To
determine the convergence time, we require the time at
which the first node joins the DAG and the time at
which last node joins the DAG, measured with the for-
mula convergence time = last node join time — first node
join time. From this formula, it is obvious that the

network convergence time increases as the node density
increases. This is also shown in Fig. 15a and b for sce-
nario I and scenario II. The slight variation in conver-
gence time is due to the latency or jitter and the time
consumed by packet processing. When the node density
increases significantly, the MRHOF shows higher con-
vergence time. This difference is caused by the longer
processing time in estimating the link quality. The ETX
calculation in MRHOF requires a slightly longer time
and becomes significant when network size increases to
100 nodes.

The energy is the scarcest resource in the sensor net-
work and communications are where most of the energy
is consumed. Thus, we provide a detailed analysis of en-
ergy consumption. Each node uses the Z1 mote platform
as described previously. The approximate current con-
sumption of the Zl mote is categorized as follows.
When the radio is OFF, the microcontroller is in an idle
state which is referred to as the low-power mode (LPM).
During the LPM, the current consumption is 20 pA. The
condition when the radio is off and the microcontroller
is in the ON state is called the CPU idle state (CPU).
During CPU idle state, the current consumption is
42.6uA. The current consumption is comparatively
highest during transmission and reception periods. The
transmission current (Tx) is 17.4mA and reception
current (Rx) is 18.8 mA. These parameters are according
to the Z1 mote standard specifications [64]. The tick-
per-second (RTIMER_ SECOND) value for the Z1 mote
is 32786. RTIMER SECOND is used to convert the ticks
into seconds. The voltage value is 3 V for all four stages.
We calculated the cumulative energy consumption of all
four stages for each network scenario. Note that the lis-
tening period energy consumption also includes the total
reception energy consumption. The following formulas
are used to measure the energy consumption in each
state:

LPM = LPM x 0.020 x 3/32, 768 3

CPU = CPU x 0.426 x 3/32, 768 4

Tx = Tx x 17.4 x 3/32, 768 5

(3)
(4)
(5)
Rx = Rx18.8 x 3/32,768 (6)

The LPM, CPU, Tx, and Rx values in ticks are ob-
tained from Energest function (energest_flush()) in the

Contiki OS. A performance comparison between OFO,
MRHOF, and QWL-RPL in terms of energy consump-
tion is shown in Figs. 16, 17, 18, 19. Most of the energy
is consumed during the reception and transmission
times. The energy consumption of the network increases
when more packets are delivered successfully. The CPU
is utilized more in MRHOF and, thus, energy consump-
tion is highest (Fig. 16a). The main reason for the higher
energy consumption is the calculation of ETX, which is
a complex procedure requiring the periodic probing
mechanism. During low power mode, the sensor saves
energy by turning off the radio. The LPM energy con-
sumption is very small and is similar in each protocol
(Fig. 16b). The similar pattern of CPU and LPM energy
consumption is observed in scenario II (Fig. 17a and b).
The greatest energy consumption occurs during Tx and
Rx periods. Even though the total amount of overhead
in OFO is the highest, the total Tx energy consumption
is greater in MRHOF, due to the poor delivery ratio of
OFO. Most of the data packets are dropped in OFO; thus,
the nodes consume less energy in transmission and it is
evident that the energy consumption for data packets is
greater than for control packets due to their relative
packet sizes.

As the network size increases, the Tx energy con-
sumption of QWL-RPL also increases (Figs. 18a and
19a) because of the differences between PRR and
PLR. The OFO has a very high percentage of over-
head as compared with QWL-RPL. The percentage
difference between data packets and overheads is de-
scribed in Figs. 15 and 16. For example, for the case
of 100 nodes in scenario I, the percentage of over-
heads transmitted in OFO is 62.61% while QWL-RPL
transmitted 20.68% overheads. Similarly, the PLR in
OFO is 87. 4% and PLR in QWL-RPL is 55.72%. The
similar result pattern is observed for scenario II.

Table 10 Analysis of Tmote Sky mote

From these results, we can understand the OFO is
consuming most of the energy in overhead transmis-
sions while most of the energy spent in QWL-RPL is
during sensor packet transmission. The MRHOF
transmitted 41.94% overheads. Similarly, in the case
of Rx energy consumption. The difference is
highlighted by the magnifier in Figs. 18b and 19b.
The simulation runs for 3600s. The sensor nodes are
meant to run for months or even for years in remote
areas. The energy differences are significant for a
network designed to run for a long period of time.

For proof of concept, we also simulated the pro-
posed mechanism with the random topology of 50
nodes as shown in Fig. 20a and b. The performance
assessment of the random topologies with fixed het-
erogeneous traffic load and varying traffic load is
shown in Tables 8 and 9. From these results, we can
see better equilibrium performance assessment results
of QWL-RPL.

Similar to Z1 mote platform, we also evaluated the
network with Tmote Sky [65] to provide a further repre-
sentation of the proposed solution. The network evalu-
ation using Tmote Sky is shown in Table 10.
Considering the metrics used in the simulation, the ad-
vantages of the proposed solution compared with the
standardized protocol is summarized in Table 11. As
OFO has no link reliability mechanism, the PRR is sig-
nificantly low when using OFO compared with MRHOF
and proposed QWL-RPL. Similarly, the average delay is
higher in OFO and MRHOF compared with QWL-RPL.
OFO route the packets through the shortest path irre-
spective of the congestion. Similarly, MRHOF uses con-
tinuously probing mechanism that generates more
control packets and thus causes congestion. The similar
performance trend is observed for jitter and a total num-
ber of overheads.

6 Conclusion and future work

The RPL routing protocol is designed to support the
LLNs characteristics. The LLN applications include di-
verse application scenarios from basic temperature
measurements to the high-volume multimedia services
that require efficient communication support. It is ne-
cessary to study the mechanism of RPL within such
varying traffic application scenarios to develop im-
proved features of RPL for the resource-constrained
nodes. In this study, we addressed the load imbalance
problem in the heterogeneous traffic scenario. We pro-
posed a new objective function for the RPL protocol
that alleviates the congestion occurrence owing to the
imbalanced traffic load. We experimented with varying
traffic loads and investigated whether traffic variations
at each interval affected the overall performance of the
proposed protocol. We studied two cases where the
first case is based on fixed heterogeneous traffic pat-
tern, while the second case discusses the varying het-
erogeneous traffic load. Using simulation analysis, we
discussed that the default objective functions, i.e., OFO
and MRHOF, cannot efficiently support the traffic het-
erogeneity. To support such scenarios, we have pro-
posed a queue- and workload-based solution (QWL-
RPL) that utilizes the weighted queue and periodic
workload information to distribute the load efficiently.
The proposed mechanism aims to balance the traffic
distribution as well as to minimize a large number of
control overheads, thereby increasing the PRR, redu-
cing the E2E packet delay, and reducing jitter. Overall,
during an imbalanced heterogeneous traffic situation,
QWL makes load- and congestion-aware routing deci-
sions. We conducted extensive simulations in the Con-
tiki OS to verify the protocol performance. In all the
network sizes examined, QWL-RPL shows better PRR
while OFO performs the worst. Similarly, in terms of
E2E delay, jitter, amount of overhead, and energy con-
sumption, QWL-RPL achieves better and more reliable
performance.

The RPL routing procedure contains an exchange of
expensive control packets. We can utilize a machine
learning algorithm to provide the routing protocol with
a self-learning, self-adaptive, and low-complexity routing
model. Thus, an interesting future direction is to shift
the need from rule-based routing to learning-based

computing and estimation in the sensor network. We
also plan to implement the proposed protocol in a real
testbed scenario.
