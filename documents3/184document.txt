Abstract

Conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers are being used in the industries for control purposes.
It is very simple in design and low in cost but it has less capability to minimize the low frequency noises of the
systems. Therefore, in this study, a low pass filter has been introduced with the derivative input of the PID
controller to minimize the noises and to improve the transient stability of the system. This paper focuses upon the
Stability improvement of a wind-diesel hybrid power system model (HPSM) using a static synchronous compensator
(STATCOM) along with a secondary PID controller with derivative filter (PIDF). Under any load disturbances, the

reactive power mismatch occurs in the HPSM that affects the system transient stability. STATCOM with PIDF
controller is used to provide reactive power support and to improve stability of the HPSM. The controller
parameters are also optimized by using soft computing technique for performance improvement. This paper
proposes the effectiveness of symbiosis organisms search algorithm for optimization purpose. Binary coded genetic
algorithm and gravitational search algorithm are used for the sake of comparison.

1 Introduction

Power system stability draws more attention due to
some major problems in modern power system network.
The stability of a power system network is broadly cate-
gorized into three types, such as, (a) rotor angle stability,
(b) frequency stability and (c) voltage stability [1].

The stability belongs to the first category is generally
happened in power system for a few seconds under short
or transient disturbances. Small signal stability is one
kind of angular stability and it is related to the low fre-
quency oscillations of the system [2]. The second kind of
instability occurs mainly due to disparity of active power

in the power system networks. It may lead to serious
problem in the network which could be overcome by
automatic generation control (AGC) [3]. Another major
stability problem that may arise in the power system net-
work is voltage instability. This type of instability occurs
in the network due to reactive power imbalance caused
by some kinds of disturbances in the system [4]. The
focus of this paper renders on control of the reactive
power profile for maintaining voltage stability of a hy-
brid power system model (HPSM).

The distributed generation (DG) is the new road map
for small power generation. DG catches attention of the
researchers for fulfilling the load demand during peak
hours (see [5]). In this case, renewable energy sources
play vital roles for its cost effectiveness and reliability

[6-8]. Hybrid generating system has come to the consid-
eration for it combines renewable energy sources with
non-renewable energy sources to provide centralized
electric power to the local areas [6]. Owing to variable
nature of the wind and the solar energy sources, these
are used widely in DG system. In this paper, wind power
is considered as renewable whereas diesel engine has
been considered as non-renewable energy source. In the
HPSM, irregular behavior of the renewable energy
source turns instability which, in turn, causes major
problems. To overcome this problem and to improve
the performance of the HPSM, various controlling ap-
proaches have been applied in the literature. A static
VAR controller (SVC) has been employed in the isolated
HPSM (refer [9]) to control its reactive power and per-
formance of the model has been analyzed by the use of
different kinds of SVC controllers such as SVC type 1,
SVC type 2 and SVC type 3.

A SVC-PID control strategy has been successfully re-
ported in the recent state-of-the-art literature in the
context of operation of a wind-diesel based HPSM.
Values of various parameters of the PID and the SVC
controller are selected in [10] by employing seeker
optimization algorithm (SOA). Static synchronous com-
pensator (STATCOM) type flexible AC transmission
systems (FACTS) devices draw more attention of the re-
searchers for their reactive as well as active power con-
trol capabilities as compared to the SVC controller (refer
[11]). A few works (such as [12—15]) were reported
where STATCOM controller has been adopted to
optimize the reactive power and to control the stability
of the HPSM. A proportional-integral (PI) controller is
applied as secondary controller along with STATCOM
or other FACTS devices to minimize other stability
problems of the HPSM.

However, this controller does not provide appropriate
results for fluctuating nature of the wind energy power
generation. To control the HPSM efficiently and to
damp out any unpredicted oscillations, this paper pre-
sents an intelligent use of proportional integral deriva-
tive (PID) controller with derivative filter (PIDF) as a
secondary controller along with a STATCOM controller
to fulfill the requisite reactive power demand at the time
of any disturbance.

For better performance of the renewable based HPSM
and fast reactive power control, different soft computing
techniques have been applied successfully in the state-
of-the-art literatures to tune the various parameters of
the controllers. Some of these techniques (such as artifi-
cial neural network (ANN) [14], particle swarm
optimization (PSO) [15], genetic algorithm (GA) [15],
SOA [16]) have proven fruitful when applied to a wind-
diesel based HPSM to optimize its various controlling
parameters.

Cheng and Prayogo [17] have presented symbiosis or-
ganisms search (SOS) algorithm in the literature for
solving constrained optimization problems.

The tentative findings of this paper are mentioned
below.

stability improvement of the considered wind-diesel
based HPSM and stability improvement capability
under small disturbances are being highlighted.

b) Various controller parameters are optimized by
various heuristic algorithm techniques and the
comparative results are presented and discussed.

c) Performance in terms of stability improvement is
presented while comparing the same with the
previous ones for the same wind-diesel based
HPSM.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next
section describes the adopted methodologies. Mathemat-
ical problem of the present work is formulated in Sec-
tion 3. The detail description of the proposed algorithm
(i.e, SOS) is given in Section 4. The obtained results are
presented and analyzed in Section 5 while the paper is
concluded in Section 6 followed by appendix and declar-
ation of the authors in Sections 7-8, in order.

2 Methods
The presented work has been carried out in MATLAB-
SIMULINK.

2.1 Modeling of HPSM under study
The studied wind-diesel based power system has been
depicted in Fig. 1. Intermittent nature of wind energy
makes the HPSM highly unbalanced in nature. Under
any electrical disturbed conditions (such as sudden
changes in load condition or severe kinds of faults), re-
active power imbalance takes place which, in turn, may
cause serious problems in the transient and the dynamic
stability of the system. Under this condition, the frame-
works for reactive power demand or its supply by vari-
ous components of the power system are given below:

In one hand, the reactive power demand by the wind
engine based induction generator (IG) running under
constant slip (s) is as in (1) (see [9]).

AQg = KiAV(s) (1)

On the contrary, the reactive power supply by the
diesel engine based synchronous generator (SG) (see [9])
is given in (2).

AQsg(s) = K2AE,(s) + K3AV(s) (2)

In (2), the term AE,(s) may be written as in (3).

Other various parameters related to (1)—(3) are de-
scribed in Appendix Section.

Under unbalanced condition, the reactive power de-
mands by the components such as load and IG is not
completely fulfilled by the SG only. Therefore, to balance
the reactive power and to maintain the stability of the
HPSM, a FACTs based controller (STATCOM based
PIDF controller) has been introduced. The design of the
applied controller is presented in next sub-section.

2.2 Design of the proposed controller

The amount of requisite reactive power may be fulfilled
by a STATCOM controller. The studied STATCOM
based PIDF controller has been incorporated in Fig. 2.
The reactive power supply by the STATCOM controller
[14] may be written in the form (4).

AQcom(s) = Gida(s) + GrAV(s) (4)

The ranges of different STATCOM-PIDF controller
(refer Fig. 2) parameters, that should be optimized by
different evolutionary algorithms, are depicted here such
as, 0.001 < K, < 100, 1 < K;< 100, 0.001 < Kz < 40, 0.001 <
N <1, 0.001 < T< 30, 0.001 < T, < 1.5 and 0.001 < T7< 1.

The other constant values of the different parameters
of the studied HPSM are given in the Appendix Section.

2.3 State space modeling of the proposed HPSM
The state space model of the complex dynamic linear
system may be represented as in (5).

3 Mathematical problem formulations

3.1 Fitness function based optimal analysis

To find out the optimal design of the controller associ-
ated with the studied HPSM, a fitness function (J) is de-
fined in (6) (in line with [18]).

fitness function (J) = 10*J, + 10*J2 + 0.01*/3
+ J (6)

The system performance should be improved by min-
imizing the J value and it should be achieved by minim-
izing the overshoot (M,), increasing the damping of the
HPSM. To minimize the fitness function and enhance
the relative degree of stability, the controller parameters
are optimized by using various soft computing
techniques.

In (6), the terms J;, Jz, J3 and J, replicate the weighting
factors and these are connected with the eigenvalues of
the studied HPSM. The first term (ie. J;, pertaining to
the real portion of eigenvalues of the HPSM) is respon-
sible for the relative stability of the system. The second
term, J> depends on the damping ratio. By appropriate
opting this weighting factor, the maximum overshoot of
the HPSM can be lessened. The third factor (i.e. J3) is
used in the fitness function to boost up the damping of
HPSM. The last factor, J, is taken as an arbitrary high
value. While choosing appropriate weighting factors dur-
ing the process of optimization, the value of J should be
minimized [10].

The changes in V; may be achieved by minimizing set-
ting time (¢,), steady state error (E,;), overshoot (M,) and
rising time (¢,). A figure of demerit (FOD) [19] is de-
signed with all these parameters as defined in (7).

FOD = (1-e*)(M, + Es) +e? (t,-t,) (7)

Here, the term f is chosen as 1.0 to reduce the over-
shoot and steady state error. If 6 is considered lesser
than 0.7, than it reduces rise time and settling time [20].

3.2 Performance indices parameters

Another approach to check the system transient stability
has been considered in this work. Various performance
indices like JAE, IATE, ISE and ITSE are defined, in
order, in (8)—(11).

4 SOS algorithm

4.1 Literature survey of the algorithm

The SOS algorithm was developed by Cheng and
Prayogo in 2014 taking the concept from various natures
inspired existing methodologies [17]. It is a metaheuris-
tic search algorithm like binary coded genetic algorithm
(BGA) [21], ant lion optimization (ALO) [22] and many
others. SOS algorithm is used to solve many engineering
optimization problems mainly in power system for its
excellent control characteristics [23]. There is no control
parameter in SOS algorithm to tune. So, the execution
time of this algorithm is much less than the others.

4.2 Basic theory of the SOS algorithm
Symbiosis means interaction between the living organ-
isms in the ecosystem. This algorithm basically works on
three basic steps taking the concept of interactions of
the living organisms in the nature and these steps are
mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. In mutualism
step, the organisms are taking part in their interaction
process and, after their interaction, both the organisms
get their advantage and, therefore, enhances their fitness
value in order to survive for longer time in the ecosys-
tem. In the next step (i.e., commensalism), one of the or-
ganism in the interacting organisms enhances its fitness
value but the other is almost unchanged. In the last step
of interactions (that means in the parasitism of interac-
tions), one organism between the interacting organisms
destroys the other and gets its benefit from the ecosys-
tem and also makes its position to the ecosystem. Taking
the concepts of these three interaction processes from
the ecosystem, SOS algorithm has been developed.

The various equations of these three processes are
given chronologically below:

For mutualism, if M; and M; are the two interacting
organisms, then after their interactions, the new M; and
M, will be as in (12) and (13), in order.

Minew = M; + rand(0, 1)*(Moes:-M V «benefit factor1) (12)

Mynew = Mj + rand(0,1)*(Miese-MV «benefit factor2) (13)

In these two equations, the term MV is known as
the mutual vector which constitutes the mutual rela-
tions between two the organisms M; and M; and is
defined in (14).
Guchhait and Banerjee Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems

_Mit+M;

MV (14)

Here, in (12)-(13), rand(0,1) represents any random
numbers which varies between 0 and 1 and M,,,, de-
scribes the maximum degree of adaptation. The values
of benefit factor1 and benefit factor2 are either 1 or 2. If
the organism gets full benefit from their interactions,
then it is 2, otherwise, for any partial benefit, it will be 1
(see [23]).

For commensalism, the new fitness value of the
benefitted organisms (i.e M; and M;) may be written
as in (15).

M jnew = M; + rand(-l, 1)*(Mpeste-M,;) (15)

Here, (Moyes: - M;) represents the gain of fitness in M;
provided by M; that helps M; to survive long time in the
ecosystem.

In last phase, two organisms (i.e, M; and M,;) partici-
pate in their interaction process. Firstly, M; creates its
own vector, namely, parasite-vector. If fitness of
parasite-vector, M; is greater than M,, then it fully de-
stroys the M; and increases the fitness of parasite-vector.
On the contrary, M; destroys M; and increases its fitness.

4.3 Algorithm flowchart
The flowchart of SOS algorithm is given in Fig. 3.

5 Simulation results and discussions

To establish the present work, simulation of the wind-
diesel based HPSM has been done in MATLAB-
SIMULINK. The terminal voltage responses are noted
by applying a small perturbation of 0.01 p.u. in reference
voltage (AV,.f) or in mechanical torque (AT;,,) or in both
for the HPSM.

The results are produced under change in load voltage
and equivalent reactance. Further, the results have been
compared to different techniques. For the studied model,
simulation run time is considered for 10s, number of
population is 60 and the number of iteration is 500.
These parameters are taken as common for all the
chosen algorithms. Other associated parameters of the
chosen algorithms and their considered values are de-
scribed in Appendix Section.

For the studied case (i.e, model along with a STAT
COM-PIDF controller), various optimizing parameters
are K,, K, Ka N, T, T, and Tq.

First of all, the results are discussed on the basis of ob-
tained convergence graph of fitness value. This fitness
value mobility profile of the studied model is given in
Fig. 4. It may be observed from the fitness function mo-
bility graph (ie. Fig. 4) that the SOS based approach
provides better result than the GSA and the BGA based
techniques. Table 1 gives the optimizing parameters of

(2020) 5:11 Page 5 of 13

the HPSM and its convergence value under different
loading conditions. It is also observed from this table
that the convergence value is less in every loading condi-
tion for the SOS based technique than the others.

5.1 Transient voltage analysis of the HPSM

5.1.1 Stability analysis under normal loading condition

The transient stability curve and its performance for dif-
ferent algorithms have been discussed in this sub-
section. Both under constant loading condition and after
the load disturbance of 0.01 p.u. The transient stability
has been checked with voltage as given in Fig. 5. The
transient voltage attains its steady state faster for the ap-
plied SOS technique. It may be concluded from Fig. 5
that the SOS based optimization technique has better
capability to minimize the settling time, overshoot and
damping of power system oscillations than the other al-
gorithmic technique. The FOD values are also given in
Table 2 and it may be stated that the FOD values for
each loading conditions are lower one for the SOS based
technique. This can be achieved by minimizing rise time,
peak overshoot, settling time and steady state error.
Table 2 also includes these values and it may be seen
that all the parameters are minimum for the SOS based
technique as compared with BGA and GSA _ based
algorithms.

5.1.2 Stability analysis under increasing or decreasing step
load variation

Figure 6 describes the controller performances while
injecting a continuous changing load profile. The transi-
ent curve shown in Fig. 7 is mostly having a flat type
profile. From this figure it may be concluded that the re-
active power mismatch under this stated load disturb-
ance is truly fulfilled.

5.1.3 Stability impact assessment under different controller
structure

a) Comparison with only model structure

In this section, the stability issues have been addressed
under two test cases (i.e. without controller and with
STATCOM-PIDF controller). The obtained transient
stability profiles are given in Fig. 8 for the SOS tech-
nique. The results in the given figure shows that, for all
the applied algorithms, the capability of stability
improvement has been increased by applying STAT
COM-PIDF controller in the model. With the help of
this controller, the response almost goes its steady state
at approximately 0.85 s, and 1.09 s for without controller.
From this observation, it may be inferred that the stabil-
ity issues of the wind-diesel HPSM may be overcome in

b) Comparison with different applied FACTS
controller

For better control of reactive power and enhancement
of stability in wind-diesel HPSM, different FACTs de-
vices are applied in [14, 16, 24]. All the controllers are
considered here for the sake of comparison. Figure 9
represents the comparative results with the considered
controller structure and it has been observed that the
transient voltage is tremendously improved by the use of
STATCOM-PIDF controller than the others under any
small disturbances.

5.2 Efficacy test of SOS algorithm

Different kinds of heuristic optimization techniques have
been taken into consideration in previous literatures for
stability improvement of the wind-diesel based HPSM.
In [14, 20, 24], oppositional harmony search (OHS),

OGSA and BGA optimization techniques are applied to
find out the optimal results of the HPSM. SOS algorithm
is also tested for this purpose as it has multiple advan-
tages over the others [17]. For the considered fitness
function (J), the applied algorithms (i.e, OGSA, OHS,
BGA and SOS) are converged with 801.2365, 712.3274,
656.8323 and 566.4984 respectively, for the input dis-
turbance of V=0.99 p.u. and Xeq = 1.08 p.u. The optimal
performance for this algorithm is better than the previ-
ously employed optimization techniques adopted for this
purposes (see Fig. 10). It may be concluded that this al-
gorithm may be considered for the stability improve-
ment of the wind-diesel HPSM as its gives the near
global optimal results.

5.3 Performance indices based analysis

The calculated values of various predefined performance
indices (see (8)—(11)) under different test conditions are
given in Table 3. It would be fascinating to note that the
SOS produces better values of performance indices as
compared to BGA and GSA counterparts. From these

file is minimized for the SOS based technique which, in
turn, improves the stability of the HPSM.

6 Conclusions and scope of future work

In this paper, a new reactive power control strategy has
been tested under predefined load profiles. Based on the
simulation results, it may be concluded that the STAT
COM-PIDF controller has properly managed an appropri-
ate reactive power compensation for the system as per its
requirement. Using this controller, the reactive power os-
cillations have been also minimized. The reactive power
problems are overcome for this adopted power system

model. From this paper, it is also seen that the transient
stability of the system has been improved by using a novel
SOS algorithm. It is also observed from the results that
the use of SOS algorithm, as an optimization algorithm,
yields better results than the other prevailing techniques
in terms of convergence characteristics and stability im-
provement. Thus, SOS may be adopted by the future re-
searchers as an optimizing tool for some other real time
optimization processes. The present work is ended while
considering linear model. However, a nonlinear system
configuration of the studied hybrid wind-diesel based hy-
brid power system may be an interesting direction for the
future researchers.
