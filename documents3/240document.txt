Abstract

An important issue in the mobile sink wireless sensor networks (MSWSNs) is sensor energy optimization. In order to
alleviate the problem of unbalanced network load and high energy consumption in MSWSNs, we proposed a new
data collection protocol in this paper: seamless clustering multi-hop routing protocol based on improved artificial bee
colony algorithm (IABCP). Because of limited by the communication sensing range and intelligence of ordinary nodes,
routing paths can only be constructed by crude methods. And the movement of the sink node will generate a large

amount of energy consumption for locating the sink node. In order to solve this problem, we assign the task of routing
table generation to the sink node, which will generate the routing table through the improved artificial bee colony
algorithm. In addition, we adopt a new method to select cluster head (CH) nodes; node uses the average energy of
the surrounding nodes and its own residual energy to calculate the claimed cluster head time. Moreover, we added a
sub cluster head CH-8 node. When the CH node reaches the number of replacement rounds, the CH-B node becomes
CH directly. The simulation results show that our routing protocol is more robust compared with three other protocols.

1 Introduction

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of hundreds or
thousands of sensor nodes, it usually includes multiple or-
dinary nodes and one or more sink nodes. Ordinary nodes
are usually arranged in space by the random or artificial
way, and cannot move after being arranged. Generally, or-
dinary nodes are powered by their own batteries, which
cannot be replenished, and periodically or event triggered
to collect the information of the surrounding environment
and transmit it to the sink node. The sink node can move
or stay freely in a wireless sensor network. Compared with
ordinary nodes, the energy of the sink node can be
regarded as infinite, and the sink node usually has higher
computing power. Therefore, the enhancement of lifetime
and energy efficiency is an important issue.

In recent years, many researchers have proposed various
routing protocols of WSNs to alleviate network load im-
balance and improve network lifetime. Network load un-
balance is a widespread problem in WSNs, and it is also a
problem that we want to avoid as much as possible. The
uneven energy consumption of each round of nodes is the
cause of network load imbalance. In WSNs, there are two
main routing methods: single-hop routing method and
multi-hop routing method. In single-hop routing and
multi-hop routing, the load of ordinary nodes is often
related to their location. Single-hop clustering routing
such as low-energy adaptive cluster hierarchical (LEACH)
[1], energy efficient clustering scheme (EECS) [2], and
most of the improved protocols based on LEACH [3] have
the problem of higher node load far from the sink node.
In multi-hop networks, such as mobile sink-based data
gathering (MSDG) [4] and economic-environmental unit-
commitment (EEUC) [5] routing protocol, it is inevitable
that nodes in a hop range of communication radius of sink

nodes are required to act as relay nodes in routing paths,
and nodes close to sink nodes have higher load. If the sink
node moves continuously and traverses the whole network
for a long enough time, the relative position of each node
to the sink node will change constantly, and the unbal-
anced state of load in the sensor network will be alleviated.
Therefore, MSWSNs [6] was born.

As mentioned above, although the mobility of the sink
node alleviates the network load imbalance [7, 8], it also
brings some problems. For example, in two-tier data dis-
semination (TTDD) protocol [9], the mobility of sink
nodes results in the failure and extension of routing path.
The failure of the routing path leads to the loss of data.
And the prolonged routing path will lead to more hops
and higher network energy consumption. Routing failure
is mainly caused by the poor update timeliness of the
routing table. The location of the sink node has changed,
but the rest of the nodes still send messages according to
the original routing table, so the data cannot reach the
sink node and lose. At the same time, it also consumes a
lot of energy in MSWSNs to synchronize the location of
sink nodes.

In this paper, in order to solve the problem of high
energy consumption and load unbalance of MSWSNs,
we propose a new clustering routing protocol for
large-scale MSWSNs. Limited by the communication
sensing range and intelligence of ordinary nodes,
routing paths can only be constructed by crude
methods in traditional routing protocols [10-12].
Therefore, in the construction of the routing path,
the balance of the network load cannot be considered.
And with the moving of the sink node, it will con-
sume a lot of energy for each node to synchronize
the location of the sink node. In our protocol, we use
the sink node to generate routes, which will generate
the routing table through the improved artificial bee
colony algorithm (IABC) [13]. The generated routing
table considers both the overall energy consumption
of the network and the balance of the network load.
And in the whole protocol flow, the sink node only
needs to know the location of the first-round cluster
head. In addition, we adopt a new method to select
CH nodes. Each node uses the average energy of the
surrounding nodes and its own residual energy to cal-
culate the claimed cluster head time. Moreover, a sub
cluster head CH-B node is added between the cluster
head and the member node. At the beginning of the
network, the CH node is selected first and then the
CH-B node. After CH runs to the set number of
rounds, the CH-f node directly replaces CH and be-
comes a new CH. Then the network selects CH-f
nodes according to the CH election method. In the
cluster, CH and CH-B nodes exist at the same time.
The cluster head can add the position of CH-B node

(2020) 2020:75 Page 2 of 20

into the data packet and pass it to the sink node so
that the sink node can obtain the position informa-
tion of the next round of CH. In this way, the node
can get the corresponding routing path generated by
the sink node without knowing the location of the
sink node. Compared with LECAH protocol, MSDG
protocol, EEUC protocol, and the original bee colony
algorithm, the protocol alleviates the load imbalance
of the network and prolongs the service life of the
network. Moreover, the optimization of the bee col-
ony algorithm improves the efficiency of protocol
routing construction.

LEACH protocol is the earliest clustering protocol
proposed. It proposes a method to reduce network
energy consumption by clustering. The protocol uses
the method of generating random numbers to declare
cluster heads (CH). Ordinary nodes join the nearest
CH as sub-nodes. The cluster head processes the data
of the nodes in the cluster and forwards the data to
the sink node. Clustering reduces the overall energy
consumption of sensor networks [14], but clustering
also causes other problems. LEACH protocol can only
adjust the size and number of clusters in the network
by adjusting the probability of nodes declaring CH.
Although nodes cannot continuously act as CH, the
geographical distribution of CH is uncertain, which
makes the lifetime of LEACH protocol unstable [15].
Moreover, the LEACH protocol communicates with
sink nodes in a single-hop mode, which has poor
adaptability to the network environment and short
lifetime in large networks. This is also a problem that
LEACH protocol and most improved protocols based
on LEACH protocol [16] cannot overcome.

Hybrid energy efficient distributed (HEED) [17]
protocol begin considers the influence of the residual
energy of the nodes and the maximum network en-
ergy of the WSNs. Therefore, a node with higher re-
sidual energy has more chances of being selected as
the CH which improves the stability of the network
and reduces the energy consumption of the network.
Therefore, a node needs to obtain the energy infor-
mation of all other nodes to determine its clustering
radius. In the cluster head election process, each node
needs a full-network broadcast. When the range of
the wireless sensor network is large, the network en-
ergy consumption is high.

Rotated unequal hybrid energy efficient distributed
(RUHEED) [18] protocol is an improvement of HEED,
in order to solve the problem of high energy consump-
tion in the large-scale network, RUHEED protocol intro-
duces the concept of “rotation.” After the tenure of the
cluster head node arrives, the cluster head node specifies
Zhang et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

the node with the largest energy as the successor node
without any judgment. This does avoid the process of
cluster head election and reduce the energy consump-
tion in the cluster head stage. However, when the nodes
die, the network will need to re cluster. When the en-
ergy of nodes is generally small, the election of CH will
inevitably accelerate the death of nodes. Even after the
death of a single node, the whole network will fall into
the process of campaign cluster head-death-campaign
cluster head-death.

EECS protocol proposes a time broadcast method
to make the network form a cluster with approxi-
mately uniform distribution, so that the selection of
CH can get rid of randomness. Ordinary node
chooses the cluster head by the distance between
cluster head nodes and sink node, so that cluster
head near the sink node has more sub-nodes. EECS
adopts a non-uniform clustering method to balance
the network load.

Power efficient gathering in sensor information system
(PEGSIS) [19] protocol is the predecessor of multi-hop
routing. It reduces the overall energy consumption of
the network by linking nodes into chains and choosing
individual nodes to communicate with sink nodes, but it
also brings about the problem of high network delay.

(2020) 2020:75 Page 3 of 20

Therefore, a real multi-hop routing protocol, such as
MSDG and EEUC protocol, is generated. MSDG proto-
col transmits data to the sink node by clustering and
tree formation. However, in the face of a high-density
network environment, its load balance is poor, and it is
easy to cause network failure due to energy holes. Al-
though EEUC balances the network load through non-
uniform clustering, its clustering and routing path con-
struction process consume more energy, and cannot
guarantee the load balance of the constructed routing,
so its lifetime is also affected.

Mobile sink-based routing protocol (MSRP) [20]
adopts the method that the mobile sink node close to
each CH to collect data. Although this approach makes
the energy consumption of the whole network relatively
low. But obviously, this method is not suitable for real-
time applications of WSNs.

In recent years, many new routing protocols have
begun to apply mature path search algorithms to the
routing construction of WSNs, such as Adaptive Peri-
odic Threshold-sensitive energy-efficient sensor network
(APTEEN) [21] protocol uses the ant colony algorithm
to build multi-hop routing. And, PEGASIS in 3DWSN
based on genetic algorithm (PEG-GA) [22] protocol im-
proves the PEGASIS protocol in the 3D application

Moreover, cluster head nodes consume additional en-
ergy for data fusion. Cluster head nodes compress and
pack the collected information of cluster nodes, which
reduces the total amount of data flowing into the net-
work. The process of packaging and compression is
called data fusion. In order to simplify the design, this
paper assumes that the cluster head will compress all
DM emitted by the collected intra-cluster nodes into the
DM size, and the energy consumption of data fusion is
set to Epa= 5 nJ/bit. The energy consumption of data

4 Protocol design

In MSWSN, routing path failure and routing path exten-
sion are often caused by the movement of sink nodes,
which leads to data loss and network energy consump-
tion increased. In addition, ordinary nodes also need to

update the location of sink nodes in real time. It often
uses the way of sending messages from the sink node
and forwarding messages to the whole network through
the surrounding nodes step by step, which will bring
great energy consumption. In order to resolve this prob-
lem, we design a new protocol: IABCP. In our protocol,
we give the routing path generation task to the sink
node, which generates the routing path through the im-
proved bee colony algorithm. Therefore, the ordinary
node does not need to synchronize the location of the
sink node. And in the whole protocol flow, the sink node
only needs to know the location of the first-round

packets and transferred to the sink node. The sink node
can calculate the time of cluster head change and calcu-
late the new routing table according to the location of
the new cluster head. And because the CH-B node be-
comes the cluster head directly when the CH change,
the seamless clustering is realized in the network. It will

When the sink node generates a new routing table, it
flips the routing table. The original routing table that
starts with the sender node and ends with the sink node
is transformed into a routing table that starts with the
sink node and ends with the sender node. The sink node
sends the information of the original routing table to
each node according to the routing table.

Clustering method will be introduced in detail in section 4.1.
The sink node generates routing tables through an improved
bee colony algorithm. The bee colony algorithm and its im-
proved method will be introduced in detail in section 4.2.

4.1 Seamless clustering of nodes

This protocol divides nodes into cluster heads, ordin-
ary nodes, and CH-f nodes, which are responsible for
different tasks. In WSN, the cluster head is respon-
sible for collecting data in cluster and communicating
among clusters, the CH-B node is the second node
after the cluster head. When the number of rounds
run by the cluster head reaches the set value, the
CH-B node upgrades directly from the CH-f node to
the cluster head. Because there are no cluster heads
and CH-B nodes in the initial clustering of networks,
it is necessary to elect both cluster heads and CH-£
nodes. In the subsequent stage, only CH-f nodes
need to be elected in the process of inter-cluster
communication. Nodes elect cluster heads by broad-
casting the declared information of cluster heads. The
time JT; of nodes sending declared information is de-
termined by Eq. (5). Among them E£; is the average
energy of nodes around node i, E; is the energy of

nodes themselves, and 7}, is the time constant. n is to
increase the random disturbance value in order to
avoid the situation that multiple nodes simultaneously
declare the cluster head. The value of 1 ranges from
— 1 to 1% of the initial energy.

It is beneficial for the load balance of the whole net-
work to use the nodes with higher energy as cluster
heads. Therefore, we make the nodes with higher energy
have smaller T; when running for cluster heads, which
makes it easier to become cluster heads. We compare
the energy of each node with the average energy of the
surrounding nodes to select the nodes with higher en-
ergy. Under the premise of avoiding frequent network
communication, this method can be used to compare
the energy of adjacent nodes.

The campaign for CH-B node occurs when the clus-
ter head receives the information within the cluster
once. At this time, the cluster head waits for the
routing table from the sink node and participates in
inter-cluster communication. The ordinary node is
idle and has enough time to elect CH-B node. The
current cluster head does not participate in the cam-
paign for CH-B node, only records the number and
position of CH-B node after the election. Because CH
needs to bear greater communication pressure and
higher energy consumption of nodes, the non-overlap
between CH and CH-f nodes makes it impossible for
nodes to become CH continuously. The generation of
CH-B node makes the replacement of the cluster head
known to the sink node. In the process of subsequent
routing table construction, the sink node can generate
the routing table in advance, and the new cluster
head does not need to inform the sink node of its lo-
cation through broadcast and forwarding, which re-
duces the complexity and energy consumption of
network communication. By upgrading the network
from CH-B node to cluster head directly at the end
of the cluster head term, the network can be seam-
lessly clustered. There is no blank area in most exist-
ing protocols because of the lack of communication
in cluster head election. The concrete steps of the

in Algorithm 3.

As shown in Fig. 3, the clustering results show that
each cluster is approximately evenly distributed within
the network coverage, and it can ensure that any cluster
head can maintain communication with at least one
cluster head within twice the cluster radius, that is, there
is no isolated cluster head in the network, and the com-
munication distance between CH can be indirectly ad-
justed by adjusting the cluster radius.

algorithm to generate the routing table by the sink node.

The principle of the ABC algorithm is to optimize the
solution; the algorithm constantly generates new

(2020) 2020:75 Page 10 of 20

solutions through the old ones and replaces the old solu-
tion with the new solution with higher fitness value.
And the solution with high fitness value has higher
optimization probability. In this way, the fitness value of
the generated solution becomes higher and higher. Fi-
nally, the optimal solution of the corresponding problem
can be found in a long enough number of rounds. In
order to increase the efficiency of the ABC algorithm,
we add window method and network hierarchical mech-
anism to the original ABC. Network hierarchical mech-
anism and window method will be introduced in 4.2.1
and 4.2.2 respectively. At the same time, the fitness
function is optimized to enhance the load balance of the
network. The optimization of the fitness function will be
introduced in detail in 4.2.3.

4.2.1 Network hierarchical mechanism

In order to reduce unnecessary energy consumption and
improve the efficiency of ABC algorithm, we adopted
the network hierarchical mechanism [23, 24] to optimize
ABC algorithm. The function of routing layering is
mainly reflected in two points:

(1) When the network is clustered for the first time,
the sink node sends the control information
containing the number of turns. After receiving the

information of the number of turns, the CH node
compares the number of turns J in the packet with
the number of turns K recorded by itself. If J > K,
the node discards the packet. If J < K, the node
updates its own turns information and makes J = J
+ 1 continue to forward. In this way, each cluster
head knows its own number of turns. When
sending its own position to sink nodes in the future,
it can guide the direction of data forwarding by
limiting the information of high cycles to be
forwarded only by nodes with low cycles, avoiding
unnecessary flooding energy consumption.

(2) When the sink node builds the route through ABC
algorithm, the sink nodes layer each node by the
distance between each cluster head and itself.
When the initial solution is generated, each node
can only transfer data to the layer closer to the sink
node. In this way, the generation of invalid
solutions is avoided. Moreover, sink node
determines the priority of routing table generation
by the distance between each node and sink node.
The farther the node is from the sink, the higher
the priority of the routing table generation. The
sink node will no longer generate a routing table
starting from the node that the peripheral node

(2020) 2020:75 Page 11 of 20

routing table passes through, reduces the total
number of generated solutions.

The schematic diagram of the network hierarchy is
shown in Fig. 4.

4.2.2 Windows screening mechanism

Network hierarchical mechanism avoids the formation
of invalid solutions in ABC algorithm. However, when
ABC algorithm searches for solutions, the number of
possible solutions is the product of the number of nodes
in each layer. Reducing the number of optional nodes in
each layer can effectively reduce the number of possible
solutions and speed up the efficiency of bee colony algo-
rithm in searching the optimal solution. So, we add the
window screening mechanism [25, 26] to ABC algo-
rithm. ABC algorithm can only select the node in the
window range when generating the initial solution and
optimizing the solution. The schematic diagram is
shown in Fig. 5.

Theoretically, the minimum energy consumption and
the minimum delay path are a straight line connecting
the sink node and the sender node. However, in practice,
nodes with a forwarding function are not necessarily dis-
tributed on this line, and the location of the distribution

does not necessarily meet the minimum energy con-
sumption condition. But this line can be used as the
condition of guiding and filtering. As shown in Fig. 5,
the central axis of the window is a straight line start-
ing from the sink node and ending at the sender
node. According to different requirements, the win-
dow size can be adjusted by adjusting the window
width. In the case of low communication delay as the
main objective, as shown in Fig. 5, the window width
is taken as the communication radius of the nodes,
and the number of possible solutions in the window
is only 45, compared with about 3000 possible solu-
tions before increasing the window method, which is
only about 1.5% of the previous ones. The size of the
window range has a great influence on the generation
and optimization of the solution. When the window
range is too small, it is easy to have no alternative so-
lution or local optimal solution. If the window size is
too large, the algorithm often needs more rounds to
get the optimal solution. Therefore, the size of the
window needs to be adjusted according to different
optimization requirements. For example, in the fol-
lowing fitness function of this paper, the goal of en-
hancing network load balancing is added. It is
necessary to increase the size of the windows

(2020) 2020:75 Page 12 of 20

appropriately. The specific size of windows in differ-
ent environments needs to be obtained through simu-
lation experiments.

4.2.3 Fitness function optimization

In ABC algorithm, the fitness function is used to evalu-
ate the fitness of the solution, and the solution with low
fitness is eliminated to retain the solution with high fit-
ness. The fitness function of the original ABC algorithm
is only related to the length of the generated path. How-
ever, when constructing the routing path by this method,
the task of the algorithm includes not only reducing the
network communication delay, but also balancing the
network load. Therefore, the fitness function is com-
posed of the average energy of the routing path, the
minimum energy of the path, and the similarity between
the generated path and the shortest path. The fitness
function is shown in Eq. (6).

Among them, E,and Emin are the average energy and
the minimum energy of the nodes on the route respect-
ively, and L; is the length of the route. That is to say,

solutions with shorter routing path, larger average en-
ergy, and larger minimum energy of passing nodes have
higher fitness value and have more chances to become
the final choice. By this method, the solution fitness of a
shorter path is higher when the energy is similar. When
the energy of nodes is differentiated, the solution with
higher average energy and higher minimum energy and
shorter path length is preferred.

5 Simulation analysis

In order to verify the performance of this protocol, the
simulation is carried out using MATLAB 2017a. The
simulation conditions are shown in Table 1. In the simu-
lation experiment, there may be changes in the number
of nodes. Other conditions are completely in accordance
with the simulation parameters in Table 1. The simula-
tion contents include routing path schematic diagram of
protocol construction, network life cycle comparison,
network load balance comparison, and bee colony algo-
rithm optimization analysis.

The initial location of the sink node is located in the
wireless sensor network, and the location is random.
The node collects data periodically and sends the data to
the sink node for communication. The moving speed of
the sink node is 5 m/s. The cluster radius is do/2, which

(2020) 2020:75 Page 13 of 20

makes the communication distance L between CH, do/
2<L<dbo. If the cluster radius continues to increase, the
communication distance between CH and CH may ex-
ceed do, resulting in a rapid increase in energy consump-
tion. In this simulation, the first node’s dead time and
the variance of residual energy are used to measure the
load balance and average communication energy con-
sumption of the protocol, and the lifetime of the net-
work is measured by half of the node’s dead time. In
networks with similar average communication energy
consumption, the first dead node with good load balance
appears later, while the first dead node will appear earl-
ier if the average communication energy consumption of
the protocol itself is large or the load balance is poor.
The variance coefficient can reflect the discrete degree
of data, so it can be used to measure the balance of net-
work load (discrete degree of node energy). When half
of the nodes in wireless sensor networks die, the net-
work is often unable to complete the tasks set, so it can
be considered that the network has failed.

The rotation period of the cluster head will also affect
the performance of the protocol. When the rotation
period of the cluster head is too long, it will damage the
load balance of the network. If the rotation period of the
cluster head is too short, it will increase the energy

consumption of the network. Therefore, the protocol is
simulated under different rotation periods of cluster
head. The results are shown in Fig. 6.

It can be seen that when the cluster head rotation
cycle is short, the first dead node appears later, but half
of the nodes die earlier. When the rotation period in-
creases, the first death node appears earlier, but half of
the nodes die later. The lifetime of the network is ex-
tended, but when the rotation period is too large, the
death time of the first node appears earlier, and the life-
time of the network is reduced. It can be seen from the
experimental results that choosing 9-13 as the rotation
period of cluster head can make the network reach a
better state, so in this paper, choosing ten as the rotation
period of cluster head.

5.1 Routing path

The cluster formed by the protocol and the route path
constructed are shown in Fig. 7. When the sink node lo-
cation does not exceed a communication radius distance
of the previous update routing table location, the data is
forwarded to the sink node within a hop range, and the
sink node can still maintain stable communication.
When the location of the sink node exceeds the

(2020) 2020:75 Page 14 of 20

communication range with the location of the last up-
date routing table, it is necessary for the sink node to re-
generate the routing table. The cluster head receives the
updated routing table and forwards the information ac-
cording to the new routing table. The red line is the
route constructed by the IABC algorithm. After the
routing table is generated by the sink node, the routing
table is forwarded to the farthest node according to the
inverted method. The farthest node sends data according
to the routing table. The relay node fuses its own infor-
mation with the forwarding information and then for-
wards it according to the routing table until it is sent to
the sink node.

5.2 Performance analysis of protocol

On the premise of the above simulation, the network
lifetime of EEUC protocol with a mobile sink node,
LEACH protocol with a mobile sink node, MSDG proto-
col with a mobile sink node, and our protocol is simu-
lated. The total number of nodes is 1600. The number
of surviving nodes varies with the number of rounds as
shown in Fig. 8. Compared with the other three proto-
cols, LEACH protocol with mobile sink has the shortest
lifetime, while other protocols adopt multi-hop routing.

By comparing the lifetime, we can find that it is more
suitable to use multi-hop routing in large networks. Al-
though MSDG adopts the method of multi-hop routing,
in the face of high-density network environment, its load
balance is poor, and its service life is short. However, the
clustering method of EEUC protocol is relatively primi-
tive, and the construction of inter-cluster communica-
tion routing needs the whole network broadcasting. The
communication process is more complex, so its lifetime
is shorter.

We chose one of the best performing protocols and
compared its main performance with our protocol in the
following papers. Figures 9, 10 and 11 show the variation
curves of the number of dead nodes, the average residual
energy of nodes, and the variance of residual energy of
nodes for IABCP and EEUC protocols. It can be seen
from Figs. 9 and 10 that half of the nodes in the IABCP
protocol have run more than 400 rounds when they die,
and the average residual energy of the nodes is less than
5%. Compared with the EEUC protocol, half of the
nodes run 160 rounds when they die, and the average re-
sidual energy of the nodes is only about 10%. It can be
concluded that the network energy consumption of
our protocol is better than that of EEUC protocol.
Through Fig. 11, the variance of residual energy of
the IABC protocol is only one half of that of EEUC
protocol, which proves that the load balance of the

(2020) 2020:75 Page 15 of 20

IABCP protocol is much better than the EEUC proto-
col. Compared with EEUC, in clustering method,
nodes only need to communicate with the nodes
within their own communication radius, and the data
transmission range of each node is small, and the en-
ergy consumption is low. And more importantly, in
the inter cluster communication, this protocol adopts
the method of routing generated by the sink node.
Only when the routing table is generated for the first
time, the location of each CH is obtained. In other
cases, the sink node calculates the time when the
CH-B node replaces the CH and generates the routing
table and transmits it to each new CH. Therefore, the
energy consumption of this protocol is very low in
the process of clustering and forming the inter cluster
routing path. In addition, this protocol considers the
problem of network load balance through fitness
function when constructing routing path, further en-
hances the network load balance, and reduces the re-
sidual energy variance of network nodes.

Node density also affects network lifetime of the differ-
ent protocols. LEACH protocol and EEUC protocol are
not significantly affected by node density, while MSDG
protocol is more sensitive to node density because of its
tree-forming method. In order to compare the perform-
ance changes of this protocol under various node dens-
ities, the EEUC protocol, MSDG protocol, LEACH

protocol, and IABCP protocol are simulated under dif-
ferent node densities in the same area. The first node’s
death time is shown in Fig. 12.

By observing the data, it can be found that the node
density has less influence on the lifetime of LEACH
protocol, and its lifetime is mainly affected by the size of
the network layout area. The density of nodes has a sig-
nificant impact on the MSDG protocol. When the dens-
ity of nodes is small, the lifetime of the MSDG protocol
is longer. On the contrary, the lifetime of the EEUC
protocol increases with the increase of the density of
nodes, because the larger the cluster head load, the more
nodes can be rotated, the more nodes can alleviate the
death of nodes. It can be seen from the graph that the
performance of this protocol is stable when the node
density changes. It basically keeps the first dead node be-
tween 250 rounds and 300 rounds. It can be seen that
the adaptability of this protocol to different environ-
ments is higher than that of EEUC protocol and MSDG
protocol. This protocol is superior to the other three
protocols in terms of network lifetime.

5.3 Analysis of optimization performance of bee colony
algorithm

If the network layering mechanism is canceled, the bee
colony algorithm becomes a completely random

(2020) 2020:75 Page 17 of 20

construction solution, which is inefficient. It is obvious
to compare the results of bee colony algorithm with or
without layered routing mechanism. Therefore, the ori-
ginal bee colony algorithm is compared with the bee col-
ony algorithm optimized by adding window screening
mechanism under the same initial node. The results are
shown in Fig. 13. The dotted line is the original bee col-
ony algorithm, and the real line is the bee colony algo-
rithm optimized by adding window _ screening
mechanism. It can be clearly seen that the quality of the
initial solution generated by the optimized bee colony al-
gorithm and the optimization speed of the solution are
greatly improved. The initial solution of the improved
bee colony algorithm through the window screening
mechanism is better than the result of 250 rounds of cal-
culation before optimization. The optimization speed of
the improved algorithm is much faster than that of the
original algorithm. It can be proved that adding window
screening mechanism in bee colony algorithm is very ef-
fective in solving the problem of constructing routing
path.

Figure 14 shows the optimization effect of the fitness
function. The two curves in Fig. 14 are the variation of
residual energy variance of 300 rounds of 1600 nodes
before and after optimization. It can be seen that the
load balancing degree of the first 50 rounds is similar,

and the path length of the generated solution is the main
consideration. With the increase of network operation
rounds, the optimized fitness function begins to consider
the cluster head energy after energy differentiation and
makes the routes with higher energy have higher fitness.
Therefore, compared with the fitness function before
optimization, the optimized fitness function reduces the
residual energy variance of nodes after 50 rounds and
enhances the load balance of the network. Figures 15
and 16 are the curves of the average length and average
hops of the path generated by the bee colony algorithm
before and after the improvement as a function of the
number of rounds. As can be seen from Fig. 15, the
average length of single hop generated by the optimized
bee colony algorithm increases with the increase of
rounds. Because the energy of cluster head nodes differ-
entiates with the increase of rounds, and the load bal-
ance in the fitness function becomes the main factor, the
path length becomes the secondary factor. And in Fig.
16, the path length before the optimization is relatively

(2020) 2020:75 Page 18 of 20

stable. The number of hops generated before and after
optimization is basically the same and about four. It also
shows that the method of generating routing in the
order of cluster head distance from the sink node from
far to near can effectively reduce the routing construc-
tion starting from close cluster head.

The size of windows has a great influence on the routing
solution construction of bee colony algorithm. When the
windows are too small, it will lead to the problem that the
path cannot be formed or the single-hop distance is too
large. When the windows are too large, the effect of reducing
the possible solution will be reduced, and the quality of the
output solution will be poor under the optimization of fixed
rounds. The ratio of window size to the number of possible
solutions to the total solution is shown in Fig. 17. It is obvi-
ous that the number of possible solutions varies greatly
under the window sizes of 60, 90, 140, 180, 220, and 270.
Therefore, the protocol is simulated under the above circum-
stances. The result is shown in Fig. 18, the residual energy
variance of nodes with different window sizes can be seen

6 Results and discussion
A data acquisition protocol IABCP for MSWSNs is pro-
posed in this paper. In this protocol, we propose a new
routing table generation method, which gives the task of
routing table generation to sink node. A routing path is
generated by the sink node through IABC, which con-
siders the energy consumption and load balance of the
network. With the addition of a new sub cluster head
CH-£ node, this routing path construction method only
needs to know the location of each cluster head when
the network is clustered for the first time. By calculating
the number of rounds of CH-f node replacing the clus-
ter head, the sink node directly calculates the routing
table of data transmission of each new cluster head. The
energy consumption of the whole route construction
process is very low. And our protocol adopts a new clus-
tering method. Nodes determine the time of claiming
cluster head by the average energy of nodes within the
communication radius and their own residual energy,
which reduces the energy consumption of each node in
the clustering stage. The simulation results show that
this protocol performs much better than LEACH, EEUC,
and MSDG in communication energy consumption, net-
work lifetime, and network load balance respectively.
Because the method of enhancing the network load
balance adopted in this protocol does not conflict with
the current methods such as non-uniform clustering [27,
28], we can try to combine with the non-uniform clus-
tering in the future work to further enhance the network
load balance. And the routing table generation method
proposed in this paper has great development potential.
It can optimize its efficiency and routing generation
method in the follow-up work. And in the follow-up
work, the function of CH-B node can also be added. For
example, CB-f can share a part of inter cluster commu-
nication or intra cluster communication load when the
communication load between cluster heads is high. The
algorithm proposed in this paper is suitable for low-
power ad-hoc wireless sensor networks to implement
cluster head selection and routing path planning. In
future work, we will apply it to actual network
environments.
