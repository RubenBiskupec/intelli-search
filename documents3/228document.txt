Abstract

Drug development is a time-consuming process from the start of research to obtain-
ing approval, and the probability of success with a candidate compound is extremely
low. We aim to understand the characteristics of the flow and localization of knowl-
edge during drug development in the global pharmaceutical industry. We analyze the
multilayer network constructed with the drug pipeline layer, global supply chain layer,
and global ownership layer. First, we identify the bow-tie structure and the commu-
nity structure of each network layer. The obtained bow-tie structure shows the large

strongly connected component and suggests that the knowledge flow in drug pipe-

lines has similar characteristics as the supply chain network. The communities in each

layer are characterized by country, category of the company, and bow tie component.
We then study the multilayer network's knowledge flow, conduct a statistical test, and
verify the significance of the overlapping links between the drug pipeline and supply

chain layers. Our results suggest a strong connection between open innovation in the
pharmaceutical industry and firms’ economic activities in the supply chain.

Introduction

The research and development (R&D) of a pharmaceutical product is time-consuming
from the start of research to obtaining approval, and the probability of success with a
candidate compound is extremely low. The probability of success from discovery and
pre-clinical initiation of a candidate compound to launch is approximately 0.1 %, the
cost of development to launch one product is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and
R&D requires more than ten years. Recently, the pharmaceutical industry’s research
costs have increased at a rate higher than the average for all industries.

In the pharmaceutical industry, leading companies undergo shifts in the processes of
R&D, production, and sales (Comanor and Scherer 2013; Scherer 2010; Munos 2009).
The R&D process is called the drug pipeline, starting with new drug discovery. The
development of new drugs requires pre-clinical testing, three stages of clinical trials, and
approval in each country.

The knowledge flow in the drug pipeline is defined as the shift of license to deal with
drug candidates. Osabe and Jibu (2013a, b, 2014a, b, c, d, e, f) pointed out that the
knowledge flow is critical in academic collaboration for the development of new drugs
and is measured as the shift of leading companies observed in the drug pipeline data.
However, the knowledge flow dynamics between the pharmaceutical companies in the
drug pipeline remain a concern (Narayana et al. 2014; Mazzola et al. 2015).

The shift of license, i.e., the knowledge flow, in drug development, is a complex phe-
nomenon arising from the relationships between pharmaceutical companies, govern-
ment institutions, and educational institutions. The multilayer networks (MLNs) are
significant concepts for understanding complex systems because many systems in the
real world are constructed from various relations between components. For example,
firms are connected by supply chain, ownership, a concurrent post of board members,
and co-application of patents Aoyama et al. (2010). Further examples of MLNs include
transportation networks (Kurant and Thiran 2006; Zou et al. 2010), climatic systems
Donges et al. (2011), economic markets Yang et al. (2009), and energy-supply networks
Buldyrev et al. (2010). The statistical mechanics in single networks are expanded into
MLNs Bianconi (2013).

Therefore, our primary research goal is to understand the characteristics of the flow
and localization of knowledge during drug development. Here, localization refers to
knowledge accumulation within the same company, observed as incoming links and self-
loops in the drug pipeline network. We analyze the drug pipeline data based on the MLN
constructed with the drug pipeline network layer, global supply-chain network layer, and
the global ownership network layer to achieve this research goal.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets used in this paper.
We specifically explain the detailed characteristics of the drug pipeline data and drug
pipelines. Section 3 explains and investigates the methods of how to construct the MLN.
The analysis and results are explained in Sect. 4, showing a statistical test to verify the
significance of the overlapping nodes and edges between a pair of layers. Finally, Sect. 5
is devoted to conclusions and discussion. Appendix 1 summarizes the analysis of a sin-
gle-layer network, and Table 1 depicts a list of abbreviations used in this paper. We use

ISO codes for countries in most of the figures and tables in this paper.

Data

Drug pipeline data

We constructed a drug database, extracting all drug data from the Cortellis Com-
petitive Intelligence database provided by Clarivate Analytics Cortellis, on Decem-
ber 11, 2013. The Cortellis Competitive Intelligence database includes pipeline data
from various drug candidates from the R&D stage to the clinical trial stages and deals
reports from approximately 7000 pharmaceutical companies. The drug development
cycle consists of discovery, launched, clinical trial, pre-registration, and registered.
Furthermore, this clinical trial can be categorized into three phases: Phase I (exam-
inations for drug safety conducted with healthy adults), Phase II (examinations for
safety and effectiveness of a drug compared with existing drugs, conducted with a few
patients), and Phase III (examinations for safety and effectiveness of a drug compared
with existing drugs conducted with many patients). Deals reports include originator

companies (i.e., the licenser) and active companies (i.e., the licensee). We indexed
these companies’ country and type. Indeed, there exist various types of business enti-
ties dealing with drug pipelines. The types are indexed as small-and medium-sized
business firms classified as a private company, large-sized businesses classified as a
public company, universities classified as educational institutions and government
institutions classified as government institutions. The extracted drugs amount to
38,295, excluding those being marked as “no development reported” in the highest
status, 18- months behind the extracting date. Notably, the drug pipeline data are a
snapshot and do not contain historical information regarding the drug development
cycle. For example, Phase III data, whose licensee is different from the licenser, can
show the shift of license of the drug candidate between them until Phase III but can-
not show when it happened.

The drug pipeline starts with discovering a new drug candidate, which requires pre-
clinical testing, three stages of clinical trials, and approval to launch. Generally, ven-
ture firms or educational institutions provide grants to the discovery of drug seeds
and the licensee. For example, leading firms advance the development to launch,
incurring considerable R&D expenses. These characteristics vary from country to
country. Drug pipeline data help us to understand the knowledge flow in the drug
development cycle as the shift of license to deal with drug candidates, i.e., the flow
from the licenser to the licensee.

Figure 1 shows the number of drug pipelines at the launched status by country,
where we counted the license of the launched drugs by country. Furthermore, we com-
pared the licensee with the licenser in drug pipelines to measure the self-sufficiency
of individual countries and companies. For example, in the United States (US), own
country in the legend means that drug pipelines are started in the US, other country
means all countries except the US, own company means that the US company as the
licensee started the drug pipeline by own company, and “other company” indicates all
companies except for the licensee. The US has launched several drug pipelines. We
found that most of the top 20 countries have discovered and launched more than half
of their drug pipelines in their countries, and the drug pipelines in China (CHN) tend
to be developed in her country compared with other countries. We anticipate that the
licensee of the drug pipeline frequently changes because of R&D expense. To charac-
terize the changes from the viewpoint of the type of business entity, we compared the
licenser or licensee type, namely, government institution, educational institution, a

private company, and public company.

Top 20 Countries

Fig. 1 The number of drug pipelines at the launched status by countries. We show the top 20 countries
with self-sufficiency rates by “own country” and “own company”. “Own country" in the legend represents the
number of drug pipelines discovered and launched by each country. In contrast, “other country” represents
the number of drug pipelines at launched status by each country, where a different country discovers them.
Similarly, “own company” in the legend represents the number of drug pipelines discovered and launched by
each country. “Other company” represents the number of drug pipelines launched by each country, where
they are discovered by the different companies from these owners

 

 

 

 

Figure 2 shows the number of drug pipelines for each status for the top four
countries in Fig. 1 and the ratio of components regarding business entity and self-
sufficiency. “Own country” in the legend represents the number of drug pipelines
discovered by each country. In contrast, “other country” represents the number of
drug pipelines at individual status by each country, where a different country dis-
covers them. Similarly, “own company” in the legend represents the number of drug
pipelines discovered by each country’s own company. “Other company” represents
the number of drug pipelines at individual status by each country, where the dif-
ferent company discovers them from these owners. As shown in Fig. 2a, the US has
approximately 8,000 drug discovery seeds, which is more than eight times compared
with that of the other countries. As expected, the government and educational insti-
tutions tend to release the license at an early stage of the R & D process and the
public company’s license acquisition rate; for example, the number of leading firms
increases as the process reaches the launched status. Furthermore, only in Japan
(JPN), the number of drug pipelines at the discovery status is smaller than that at the
launched status. Because of the lack of drug discovery seeds nowadays will decline
the country’s pharmaceutical industry in the future, countries such as JPN must
obtain drug pipelines from other countries.

Figure 3 shows the knowledge flows in the drug pipelines between the licenser and
licensee at the country level per pipeline status. Here we focus on the top 10 coun-
tries in Fig. 1 and aggregate the pre-registration and registered statuses because of
the availability of a few pipelines. We ignore the drug pipelines whose license has
not shifted to investigate the flows between different business entities. The diago-
nal elements correspond to the knowledge flows between companies in the country;
thus, the knowledge flows from the firms in the US to the other countries in the
drug pipelines. Furthermore, the knowledge of drug pipelines seems to flow not only
in the direction from firms in the US to the others but also in the opposite direction.

Supply chain and ownership data

The global supply chain and ownership data in the year 2017 were constructed by col-
lecting various companies’ data from the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Capital IQ platform
website CapitallQ. The Capital IQ dataset covers more than 500,000 companies with
information on business relations in 217 countries in 159 industrial sectors defined by
the S&P, including all listed companies in the world. The data include company ID, com-

pany name, country, location of the company, company type, and the primary industry

Fig. 3 Knowledge flows of drug pipelines between licenser and licensee at country level per pipeline status
focused on the top 10 countries in Fig. 1. Each element represents the number of drug pipelines between
countries, ignored the drug pipelines whose license has not shifted. The diagonal elements correspond to
the number of shifts of licenses between companies in the country

as node information. Industrial classification is based on the Global Industry Classifi-
cation Standard, developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International and the S&P. The
supply chain data also include examples of the business relationship between the sup-
plier and customer as the edge information. Although various business relations that
fall under suppliers are supplier, creditor, franchiser, licenser, landlord, lessor, auditor,
transfer agent, investor relations firm, and vendor, most are supplier and creditor. Here,

the supplier is a company providing the products or services, whereas the creditor is a

private, public, or institutional entity availing funds to others to borrow. Notably, the
links in the dataset are dominated by supply chain business relationships. Therefore, the
characteristics of the dataset reflect the global supply chain network.

The ownership data include a list of shareholding companies and individuals for each
company as the link information. The list comprises the top 100 owner companies and
individuals with the ownership ratio data. The link’s weight is the ownership ratio owned
by the owner between 0% and 100%. The listed firms dominate firms in the ownership
data for each country. Therefore, the coverage of ownership data is narrower than that of
the supply chain data (Table 2).

Notably, the collection years for the two datasets, namely, the drug pipeline data and
the company’s supply chain and ownership data, are different because of data availabil-
ity. The former data are for 2013, whereas the latter is for 2017. The four-year difference
in the data on the rapidly changing pharmaceutical industry might be a weakness. In this
paper, we clarify the relationship among the knowledge flows, the flow of goods, and
capital flow in the global pharmaceutical industry by analyzing the data as the MLN. The

study is the first attempt and therefore considered significant enough.

Methodology

This study’s primary purpose is to reveal the dynamics of propagation and the locali-
zation of knowledge in the drug development cycle by analyzing the drug pipeline and
supply chain and ownership data. For this research, we constructed an MLN, simulta-
neously representing three types of relationships between companies and institutions
regarding the knowledge flow in the drug pipeline. Before we move to the MLN analysis,

we explain the definition of the networks of each layer.

Drug pipeline network

We represent the drug pipeline data acquired from Clarivate Analytics as a drug pipe-
line network G; in Fig. 4. In the graph G] = (Vj, £1), Vi is a node-set constructed from
companies, government, and educational institutions listed in the drug pipeline data,
and E£) is an edge set constructed from licensor-—licensee relations on drug pipelines.
Let us denote that a directional edge is present as i — j in the drug pipeline network,
where node i is the licenser, and node j is the drug candidate’s licensee in the drug
pipeline data. As mentioned in Sect. 2, nodes are various types of business entities
categorized as a government institution, educational institution, private company,
and public company. One drug pipeline also does not always define one edge in the
drug pipeline network because there is the case that the originator of the drug candi-
date shares the license with two companies. We denote the adjacency matrix of G as
Al — (at}!), where the element aj corresponds to the number of edges from node i

Fig. 4 Overview of the MLN representation. We used the drug pipeline, supply chain, and ownership data to
define the MLN (M = 3), which is composed of firms and institutions as nodes. Then, we construct MLN for

to j. The superscript represents the layer index. The in- and out-degrees of node i are
defined by ki =) aj and kK =) ai: In the graph Gi, ki and ko; represents
the total number of drug pipeline that the company i is dealing with, and the total
number of drug pipeline that the company i has discovered, respectively. Moreover,
the drug pipeline data contains the case that the drug pipeline’s licensee corresponds
to the licenser. In other words, the graph G, contains self-loops, and the number of
self-loops of node i are computed as eh = a\! ! In order to distinguish the shifts of
license with the other, we denote the number of edges of node i from/to different

nodes as in-/out-degree removed self-loops,

[1] _ ,[1] [1] HW} _ 7,0) [1]
Mini = Kini 7 Ej and Mouti = Kuti 7 bj . (1)
Thus, mi and mi represents the number of license of drug candidates that the com-

pany i has transferred to the others, and that the company i has obtained from the oth-
ers, respectively. Therefore, in the graph Gj, the edges (i # 7) are knowledge flows in the
drug pipelines. However, the self-loops (i = 7) represents the localization of the knowl-
edge in one company.

Furthermore, the drug pipeline data is a snapshot data and a record at a particular
development stage. Thus, we use the status of the drug development cycle as edge
attribution, FE, = U, EY , and EY represents the drug pipeline at the status p € {Discov-
ery, Phase I-III Clinical, Pre-registration, Registered, Launched}. In response to the
extension, we add the status index p to the definitions of the characteristics such as

in-degree of the company i, klip

‘nj * For example, the launched drug without transfer of

license is represented as a self-loop with the launched attribution in the network, and
elie at p = {Launched} represents the number of launched drugs for which the com-
pany i discovered and has launched. Although we cannot determine when drug candi-
dates’ license is transferred because of data property, we can observe the tendency of
knowledge flows in the drug pipeline between business entities in the pharmaceutical

area.

Supply chain network

The supplier-customer relationship is most important at the company level in the real
economy. We represent the supply chain data acquired from the S&P Capital IQ data-
set as a supply-chain network Gp in Fig. 4. In the graph G2 = (Vo, E2), V2 is a node-
set constructed from companies listed in the supply chain data, and Ep is a edge set
constructed from these supplier—customer relations. The supply chain network is an
unweighted directed network, representing the supply chain business relationships.
We denote a directional edge as i > j when company j is a supplier to company j. The
in- and out-degrees of node i are defined by ki = ja); land ken =) aj: More-
over, we denote the number of edges of node i from/to different nodes as in-/out-
21 x l?t ee and mi?! = xl er In the graph

degree removed self-loops, mj, ; = ky; outi = Kouti

[2] [2]

in,i and Mout,i

Go, m represents the number of suppliers and customers of company i,

respectively.

Ownership network
We define ownership networks G3 in Fig. 4 based on the S&P Capital IQ dataset. In
the graph G3 = (V3, £3), V3 is a node-set constructed from companies listed in the
ownership data, and £3 is an edge set constructed from these ownership relations.
We denote an edge from company i to j when company j has a stake in the company
i. The in- and out-degrees of node i are defined by kj = ja; and kel = Dy ai:
Moreover, we denote the number of edges of node i from/to different nodes as in-/

[3] [3]

in,i and m out,i

graph G3, m represents the number of companies which company i holds
shares, and the number of shareholders of company i, respectively. Furthermore, the
number of owners of each company was limited to 100 in the S&P Capital IQ data-
set. Although the S&P Capital IQ dataset includes the ownership ratio, we define the
ownership network as an unweighted directed network to increase the number of
duplicated nodes between layers. Note that the ownership network in this paper rep-
resents the dependency flow, which is in the opposite direction to that typically used

because we assume that the firm knowledge tends to flow to these owners.

Combining datasets

To construct the MLN in Fig. 4, we must combine the drug pipeline data and the
company’s supply chain and ownership data. Because the company’s name in the two
datasets is not always the same, we performed name identification between the two
datasets by using information about the country and industry after removing abbre-
viations such as Inc and Corp. When multiple candidates arose, we checked them

manually.

MLN representation

In this subsection, we generalize the definitions of our networks using an
MLN framework. Generally, the MLN is a pair defined as M=(G,C), where
G={Gy;ae€{l1,---,M}} of the family of graphs Gy =(Vy,E.), where the
set of nodes of layer Gy is denoted as Vy, and M is the number of layers.
Goto et al. Appl Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 10 of 25

C = {Eup C Va x Vesa, 8 € {1,---,M},a & B} is a set of interconnections between
the nodes of different layers Gy and Gg witha 4 B. We define the MLN (M = 3), com-
posed of companies and institutions as nodes and three types of interactions between
them, by using the drug pipeline, supply chain, and ownership data. Because each
layer of our MLN is defined by the types of interactions, there are overlapped nodes
but no interconnection between the nodes of different layers: C = {G}. The graphs Gy
for each layer are defined as

¢ Gy ,: Drug pipeline network
¢ Gp»: Supply-chain network
¢ G3: Ownership network

where the definitions for each layer are explained in previous subsections. Figure 4 dis-

plays the conceptual representation of MLN.

The adjacency matrix of each layer Gy is denoted by Al@! = (al), where the element

ij
i corresponds to the number of edges from node i to j in the a-th layer. The in- and

out-degrees of a node i of the MLN are defined as vectors:

a

— (7 [2] [3] ~— (7, [2] [3]

Kini (Ki, Kn kph) and Kouti (Kah K out? Keti) (2)
where kj and ket are the in- and out-degrees of node i in the a-th layer, iee.,
kj =) aj and Ker i= dy ai Similarly, we denote the number of self-loops of node
i in the a-th layer as, ei = ail, In this paper, we must recognize the flows as self-loops

because self-loops in the drug pipeline network G; correspond to the accumulation of
knowledge. Thus, we count the number of flows in each layer by the edges between two
nodes and self-loops. The number of edges of node i from/to different nodes is denoted
as

mal — xlel ei and mil. — xlel ei ; (3)

in,i in,i out,i out,i

and their total number is

1 Na Na
_ ) [a] =) } [a]
ij=1,iFj i

where Ny is the number of nodes in a-th layer. Notably, we added the status layer index p
to the definitions of the first layer characteristics such as in-degree of the i-th node kin?

and the total number of edges M7.

Bow tie structure

As we showed in the edge-level analysis in Sect. 2, the knowledge flow in the drug
pipeline seems to be circulated at the country level; however, whether the flows con-
nect at the company level is unclear. Generally, the giant weakly connected components
(GWCCs) of a directed network can be decomposed as giant strongly connected com-
ponents (GSCCs), which is the largest size of the SCC in the GWC, its upstream and

downstream portions (IN and OUT) known as the bow tie decomposition in the Web
Goto et al. App! Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 11 of 25

Broder et al. (2000). This decomposition could help us understand the hierarchical and

circular flows of the networks from a macroscopic perspective.

Community structure

Besides the macroscopic structure measured as a bow-tie structure, a community detec-
tion is a powerful tool for explaining densely connected networks’ structural properties.
We compared the structural properties between layers by using node attributes such as
country and primary industry. Although we show the detailed analysis of community
structure of each network in 6.2, we explain the method that is useful to extract commu-
nity structures of a network here.

To find communities in the GWCC of the layers, we use the map equation method
Rosvall and Bergstrom (2008), known as Infomap, which is one of the best performing
community detection methods Lancichinetti and Fortunato (2009). The map equation
method is a flow-based and information-theoretic approach to find an efficient code
for minimizing the length of the description of the random walk for generating a mod-
ule partition M to divide 1 nodes into m communities. Then, the average single-step
description length is defined as

L(M) = qaH(Q) + >— pinH (Pi) - (5)

i=l

The first term arises from the movements of the random walker across modules, where
q-y is the probability that the random walker switches communities, and H(Q) depicts
the average description length of the community index codewords given by the Shan-
non entropy. The second term arises from the intra-community movement of the ran-
dom walker, where the weight pj) represents the fraction of the movements within the
community, and H(P;) represents the entropy of the intra-community movement. Fur-
thermore, this method has been extended to a hierarchical map equation Rosvall and
Bergstrom (2011) that decomposes a network into communities and sub-communities.

We detect the hierarchical communities by using the multi-coding Infomap method,
and we use the “Level” index to represent the hierarchy of communities; communities at
the 2nd level represent sub-communities at the 1st level. To characterize the hierarchical
communities, we use node attributions with country, company type, and bow tie compo-
nent for the drug pipeline layer, and country, primary industry, and bow tie component
for the supply-chain and ownership layer, respectively.

Interlayer degree correlations

It is reasonable to assume that a hub node in the drug pipeline network could be a hub
in the supply chain or ownership network. Thus, to verify this assumption, we investi-
gate the degree correlations for each node between different layers. However, we must
note that the edges in the drug pipeline layer E/ characterized by the status p € {Dis-
covery, Phase I-III Clinical, Pre-registration, Registered, Launched}, and the drug pipe-
lines that have not reached the launched stage could disappear in the drug development
cycle. Therefore, we only focus on the launched case here. Furthermore, each company’s

incoming edges in the drug pipeline layer are equal to the number of drugs with which
Goto et al. App! Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 12 of 25

it is dealing. From this perspective, we divide the edges on which we focus in the drug

pipeline layer into two types:
¢ Self-loops, gle lat p = {Launched}, corresponding to the number of launched drugs
that the company i discovered as the licenser and has launched. In this paper, we
define that ele lat p = {Launched} represents the closed innovation.

« In-degrees removed self-loops, my lat p = {Launched}, corresponding to the num-
ber of launched drugs for which company i was not licensed originally but owns
because of the licensee. In this paper, we define that me lat p = {Launched} repre-

sents the open innovation.

Node and edge overlap

Although the dynamics of knowledge flows in the drug pipeline between companies
remain unclear, we can raise a possible hypothesis for the edge-level similarity. When
drug pipelines develop in a too closed situation, such that pharmaceutical companies do
not have business with the same industry, the supply chain’s edge-level similarity ceases
to appear. However, the alliances between the pharmaceutical companies, i.e., open
innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, could share not only markets but also drug
pipelines, which is assumed to appear as the edge-level similarity to the supply-chain
layer. Furthermore, if the drug pipeline tends to be transferred to the owner of its licen-
sor, we might observe the edge-level similarities to the ownership network. Although
knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry might flow along with the flow of control, it is
challenging to observe it in our MLN when the mergers and acquisition (M&A) causes

it. To confirm the above hypothesis, we compute the overlapping of nodes and edges as

Xo 1 Xz

a

(6)

 

where Xq is a set of nodes/edges at the a-th layer. We measure the overlap by the frac-
tion of nodes/edges appearing in both layers over the aggregate number of nodes/edges
of the two layers. We ignore the multiple edges and self-loops in the drug pipeline layer.
To evaluate the statistical significance of the finding stated above more precisely, we
compute the probabilities (p values) when the expected number of overlapped edges is
larger than the observed value by using a statistical test. Here, the null hypothesis is that
we have no edge overlap between the two layers. First, we assume that the probability of
generating the a-th layer having the x overlapping edges obeys the binomial distribution,
x ~ B(n, p(B|a)), where 1 = Ew U Eg . We define the conditional probability that the
edge connects between the two nodes of the overlapping knowledge flow layer (6 = 1)

and the a-th layer as

( clo]

(7)

 

P(B = 1a) =p. X Pu = 1X

’

where (k!“!) is the half value of the averaged total degree of the a-th layer. Therefore, the
last term in the right-hand side of this equation corresponds to the probability of finding
Goto et al. App! Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 13 of 25

the edges for randomly selected pairs of nodes. Here, the drug pipeline layer (6 = 1) is
independent variable of the a-th layer, p; = 1, by definition.

Results
In this section, first, the results of the single-layer analysis were explained, and then the
multi-layer analysis was performed based on the results.

Single-layer analysis

In preparation for MLN analysis, we carried out an analysis of the bow-tie structure and
the community structure of every single layer: the drug pipeline network, the supply
chain network, and the ownership network. Bow tie analysis suggests that the knowl-
edge flows in drug pipelines have similar macroscopic characteristics as those of the
supply chain network. For a comparison of the structural properties between layers, we
conducted the community detection using the Infomap method and characterized each
community in terms of node attributes such as country and primary industry. For the
detailed discussion of single-layer analysis, see Appendix 1. As discussed in Sect. 2, the
knowledge flow between the licenser and licensee to circulate at the country level and
the global level because of the US companies. We observed a large size of SCC in the
bow-tie structure at the company level in the drug pipeline network, which is a large-

scale circular flow between pharmaceutical companies.

Interlayer degree correlations

We constructed the MLN to investigate the knowledge flow between companies in drug
pipelines using the drug pipeline, supply-chain, and ownership data. Table 3 summarizes
the number of nodes, edges, and self-loops for each layer of the MLN, where we list the
number of the cases successfully combined by the Coritellis and Capital IQ datasets in
parentheses. Table 4 shows the knowledge flows in drug pipelines for each status of the
drug development cycle.

We show the relations between the number of launched drugs and the number of sup-
plier—customer (ownership) links in the upper (lower) part of Fig. 5. Note that the num-
ber of drugs corresponds to the edges attributed to p = {Launched} at the drug pipeline
layer, and Fig. 5 does not contain companies not dealing with launched drugs. This is
the reason that the number of data points in Fig. 5 is less than the number of nodes in
Table 3.

As defined in Sect. 3, ne land my lat p = {Launched} represents the closed and open
innovation, respectively. Thus, we can investigate the relation between layers from Fig. 5a
and c for the closed innovation, and Fig. 5b and d for the open innovation, respectively. We

also calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients as denoted on these figures. Note that
Goto et al. App! Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 15 of 25

the upper limits at approximately 100 for the out-degree in the ownership layer because
of the threshold in data collection. This is why we do not compute the Pearson correlation

coefficients relating to out-degree in the ownership layer. Notably, the companies having

larger move lat p = {Launched} have a larger number of supplier—customer or ownership
relations. As a result, we have weak and positive interlayer degree correlations between

the drug pipeline and both supply chain and ownership. Especially, we observed more

strong correlation in the open innovation, which is measured by my lat p = {Launched}
in Fig. 5b and d, than the closed innovation in Fig. 5a and c. Therefore, we could expect
that open and closed innovation is useful for some companies with a larger number of sup-
pliers—customer or ownership relations in the pharmaceutical industry— and they appear

more remarkably in open innovation.

Node and edge overlap
Table 5 shows the node and edge overlap between the two layers. We demonstrate the over-
lapping of nodes and edges between the layers by measuring the fraction of nodes/edges
appearing in both layers over the aggregate number of nodes/edges of the two layers. There
is a lower proportion of node/edge overlap present at the ownership layer, which is more
remarkable than the GWCC case.

Table 5 shows that the overlap between the knowledge flow layer and the supply chain
layer is more extensive than other combinations of layers in both the node overlap and edge
overlap. Now, the conditional probabilities p(1|@) are given as

for the GWCC of supply chain (# = 2) and ownership (@ = 3) network. Figure 6 com-
pares the comparisons of the actual number of edge overlaps with the above binomial
distributions, where Fig. 6a shows the supply chain and (b) the ownership network.
Consequently, the p-value shows a value approximately equal to zero (one) for the
supply-chain (ownership) layer. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected (adopted) for
the supply chain (ownership) layer, proving that the observed edge overlaps between
the knowledge flow and the supply chain (ownership) layers are (are not) statistically
significant.

Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry’s knowledge flows are related to the flow of
products associated with the supply chain, rather than the dependency based on the
ownership network. This suggests that pharmaceutical companies use open innovation
to share the drug pipeline and spread the business market as the supply chain. Although
we do not use the ownership data, including M&A, the relation between the knowledge
flow of the drug pipeline and ownership network is rare. Future work, therefore, should
compare the traditional M&A strategy of pharmaceutical companies with their sustain-
able growth.

The similarity between the knowledge flows of drug pipelines and supply-chain net-
works is also observed at the edge level, i-e., the licenser (licensee) of drug pipelines tends
to be the supplier (customer), and a hub of knowledge flows of the drug pipelines tends
to be their hub in the supply chain. Our results suggest a strong connection between
an open innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and firms’ activities regarding the
supply chain. Generally, the pharmaceutical industries promote drug discovery and a
clinical trial using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. For example, large pharmaceutical
Goto et al. App! Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 17 of 25

companies, such as Pfizer and Novartis, deployed AI systems for drug discovery and
clinical trials by IBM Pharmatutor.org , Fleming (2018). This collaboration suggests an
increase in the need for the relation between drug pipelines and supply chains in other
industries. Based on the analysis, our findings, therefore, agree with the reported situa-

tion of pharmaceutical innovation.

Implications

Open innovation is a lucrative field within industries relying on innovation. Specifically,
the pharmaceutical industry represents knowledge-intensive industries, and open inno-
vation should significantly boost pharmaceutical collaborations and reduce the cost of
long-term R & D processes or the M & A in closed innovation.

Consequently, the development of a new drug and trial requires high investment, but
with a low possibility of success. Private companies, such as small and medium enter-
prises and ventures, end up funding innovations because of high investments. Further-
more, public companies, such as big pharmaceutical companies, are always looking for
new available targets. Thus, to boost pharmaceutical innovation, based on globalized
and IT innovation, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of innovation regarding the
firm-level economy’s various interactions.

To reveal pharmaceutical innovation’s actual situation, we proposed an MLN frame-
work using the drug pipeline, global supply chain, and ownership data. Furthermore, we
investigated the characteristics of the knowledge flows between the licenser and licen-
see, defined by the drug pipeline data, from the proposed framework. Several seeds of
the drug pipeline were discovered in the US and provided to other countries. Larger
firms, such as public companies having an individual market in the supply chain, can
hold many drug pipelines as a licensee, causing pharmaceutical knowledge flows cross-
borders among countries. The macroscopic structure of pharmaceutical knowledge
flows provides us knowledge about the characteristics of each country. Because the US
firms provide drug pipeline seeds, they compose the upper stream of the entire network
of the knowledge flow of the drug pipeline. Although firms in JPN do not have many
drug seeds, they deal with the second-largest launched drug pipeline. Several firms in
JPN are interdependent with others on drug development. From a macroscopic struc-
ture, we can confirm that most of the firms in JPN are located in the largest size of the
SCC. By contrast, the firms in CHN, having a high self-sufficiency rate of drug pipelines,
do not involve the circular flow of knowledge of drug pipelines with others. Further-
more, the tendency of closed innovation in CHN is seen from a closed community of
pharmaceutical firms in CHN in the global supply chain network.

Finally, an essential question for future studies is to understand how some opera-
tions, such as policy making, could boost pharmaceutical innovation. Thus, our study
provides a framework for future studies to assess pharmaceutical innovation’s charac-
teristics regarding various firm-level activities by using MLN representation. Although
our results are inspiring, more investigations are required for further improvements.
The traditional M&A strategy of pharmaceutical companies could be evaluated based on
their sustainable growth by combining the historical M&A data with our networks. Fur-
thermore, our approach can investigate how the risk, patent cliff in the pharmaceutical
Goto et al. Appl Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 18 of 25

industry will spread to other sectors in the future. We hope that future studies could

reduce unnecessary risk.

Conclusion

Drug development is time-consuming from the start of research to obtaining approval,
and the probability of success with a candidate compound is extremely low. We evalu-
ated the characteristics of the flow and localization of knowledge during drug develop-
ment in the global pharmaceutical industry.

We analyzed the MLN constructed with the drug pipeline network layer, the global
supply chain network layer, and the global ownership network layer. First, we focused on
the flows in an individual layer of MLNs, licenses as knowledge, goods, and capital. We
identified the bow tie and the community structure of each network layer. The obtained
bow-tie structure suggested that the knowledge flows in drug pipelines have macro-
scopic characteristics similar to the supply chain network, characterized as the larger
SCC size. The obtained communities in three layers were characterized by country, cat-
egory of the company, and bow tie component.

After analyzing individual layers, we studied the knowledge flows in the MLN, pri-
marily whether the knowledge flows are related to the flow of goods in the supply chain
or the flow of capital in the ownership. Based on the results obtained from the MLN
analysis, we conducted a statistical test. We verified the significance of the overlapping
of edges between drug pipeline and supply-chain layers. Our results suggest a strong
connection between open innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and its economic
activities in the supply chain.

Bow tie structure

Although the knowledge flow in the drug pipeline seems to be circulated at the coun-
try level by the edge-level analysis, whether the flows connect at the network level or
not remains unclear.

First, we computed the number and sizes of SCC for each layer. We show the distri-
butions of SCC size for each layer in Fig. 7. Compared to the size of GSCC in the sup-
ply chain layer with the second-largest SCC, it is clear that the supply chain network
contains an immensely large circular flow. On the other hand, there is no significantly
larger SCC than the others in the ownership network. In the drug pipeline network, it
is apparent that only small SCCs except for GSCC.

We show the bow-tie decomposition results for each layer network in Table 6,
where we define the GWCC components not belonging to the GSCC, IN, and OUT
components as Tendril (TE). The ownership network has an entirely different bow-tie
structure than the others. The ownership network does not have a large SCC, such as
a large circular flow of control. Conversely, the drug pipeline layer’s bow-tie structure
has similar fractions of components than those of the supply-chain layer. Our results
suggest that the knowledge flows in drug pipelines have similar macroscopic charac-
teristics as those of the supply chain network, especially the larger SCCs in the flows.
Goto et al. App! Netw Sci (2020) 5:87 Page 20 of 25

Furthermore, we investigated the role of each country in the knowledge circulation
of the drug pipeline layer. Figure 8 shows the number of each bow-tie component of
the drug pipeline layer by country, where we listed the top four countries located in
GWCC. We categorized each component using the type of business entities; Private
Company, Public Company, Educational, and Government Institutions. As shown in
Fig. 8a, most companies in the US are located on the IN component, which is consist-
ent with most drug pipelines at discovery status in the US (Sect. 2). Figure 8b shows
that several public companies in JPN belong to GSCC of the drug pipeline networks.
Although the GWCC in the drug pipeline layer is composed mainly of firms in the
US, these companies should provide the drug pipeline seeds to the whole system, and
the leading company in JPN contributes to the circular flow of knowledge. Further-
more, as shown in Fig. 8c and d, the companies in CHN does not contribute to the
largest SCC in the GWCC, and this structure is not found in other countries.

Community structure

For a comparison of the structural properties between layers, we conducted the commu-
nity detection known as the Infomap method and characterized each community using
node attributes such as country and primary industry. We detected the hierarchical
communities by using the multi-coding Infomap method. Table 7 summarizes the sta-
tistics in terms of hierarchical communities, where “Level” index represents the hierar-
chy of communities; communities at the 2nd level represent sub-communities at the Ist
level. “#com.’ is the number of all communities at each level, “#irr.com, is the number
of irreducible communities, which are communities that do not have any sub-commu-
nities. We determined the number of nodes “#nodes” such as firms and institutions, in
irreducible communities at each level. We find that most of the firms belong to 2nd level
communities except for the ownership network layer. Therefore, we limit our discussion
of the properties of sub-communities to those of the 2nd level.

In Table 8, we show the characteristics of the largest community at the first layer for
the drug pipeline layer and the three largest communities at the second level, where we
use the attributions of country, bow tie component, and category of the company for
this layer, and measure the community size by using the number of nodes in the com-
munity. Then, comparing the fraction of attributions at the first and second levels reveals
that each community has similar characteristics, including 10% of public companies. The
knowledge of the drug pipelines flows into the set of several private companies and a few
leading firms and is widely distributed in the largest community.

Second, we demonstrate the characteristics of the communities in the other layers,
using the primary industry attributes instead of the category of companies. As shown in
Table 9, the primary industry of the firms forms the communities at the first level in the
supply-chain layer, and the third-largest community labeled fourth has a significant frac-
tion of the pharmaceutical sector. To investigate the relationship between the knowledge
flows in the pharmaceutical industry, we investigate the second-level sub-communities
in the community labeled fourth in Table 10. Note that the community comprising the
pharmaceutical firms in CHN is the second-largest sub-community at the supply chain
layer. These trends align with the previously discussed structure of the knowledge flows
in drug pipelines in CHN, which is too close.

Finally, Table 11 shows the characteristics of the six largest communities at the first
level. Table 12 shows the characteristics of the three largest sub-communities of the

largest community at the 1st level in the ownership layer. Consequently, based on own-

ership, there are no significant characteristics in the largest communities. However, at

this level, it is challenging to relate the knowledge flows of the drug pipelines in this

stage, future work should focus on the relation to the community of dependency flow, in

contrast to the knowledge flows by the mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
