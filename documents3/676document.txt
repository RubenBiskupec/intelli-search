quantify editing and linking behavior. Our analysis unveils that conflicted articles differ
substantially from others in almost all metrics, while we also detect slight trends for
high-quality articles. With our network analysis we find evidence indicating that

controversial and edit war articles frequently span structural holes in the Wikipedia

Introduction

Editing behavior on Wikipedia has been a widely studied subject in previous research
(Brandes et al. 2009; Flock et al. 2017; Kittur et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2017; Yasseri et al.
2012). In particular, past studies investigated the misbehavior on Wikipedia including,
among others, vandalism (Adler et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2015), conflict or controversy
(Borra et al. 2015; Yasseri et al. 2014), and so-called edit wars (Sumi et al. 2011; Yasseri
and Kertész 2013). Edit wars are a type of behavior in which two or more opposing edi-
tors (or editor groups) override each other’s content due to differences in opinion on
a given subject. Prominent examples of such behavior include the Wikipedia pages on
Nikola Tesla! or Barack Obama.” In controversial articles, disputes mainly arise because

their content represents controversial issues of our society, such as Evolution®. Scientif-
ically, studying edit wars and controversial articles on Wikipedia has been and still is an
important endeavor, as several studies show the connection between article quality and
editing behavior on Wikipedia (Arazy et al. 2011; Editorial 2006; Lerner and Lomi 2019;
Samoilenko et al. 2018). Practically, this research may help upgrade prevalent conflict
prediction methods, such as those using mutual reverts (Gandica et al. 2014; Yasseri and
Kertész 2013).

This paper extends our previous work, which investigates Wikipedia editing behavior in
regard to the relation of editing and linking across article quality categories (Ruprechter
et al. 2019). In this work, we expand our investigations towards low- and high-quality
content, controversial issues, and edit war articles in the Wikipedia network. We fur-
ther demonstrate the predictive potential of computed article metrics, especially along
the dimensions of non-conflicted versus conflicted and low-quality versus high-quality
articles. To that end, we are interested in the following research questions:

I) Characterization. How can we characterize editing behavior on Wikipedia?

II) Relation existence and strength. Is there a relation between editing behavior,
article quality, and internal Wikipedia hyperlink (wikilink) network topology? If
such a relation exists, how strong is it?

III) Prediction. Are editing behavior and wikilink network metrics predictive of edit

war articles, controversy, or article quality?

To answer these research questions, we: (i) classify edit actions for 4941 Wikipedia
articles using a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, (ii) compute relative frequen-
cies of edit actions and build first-order Markov chains from edit sequences for each of
our Wikipedia articles, (iii) perform statistical significance tests on results to characterize
differences in editing behavior, (iv) extract a wikilink network for our article sample, (v)
compute and compare standard network metrics of sampled articles given article quality,
and (vi)perform classification experiments showing the applicability of editing behavior
and network metrics as prediction parameters.

We find that there is significant difference in editing behavior between edit wars or simi-
lar controversially edited content and higher quality articles, which corroborates previous
results on edit wars (Sumi et al. 2011; Yasseri et al. 2012). Adding to those studies, we find
that editors of conflicted articles make meaning-changing edits significantly more often
while performing less formatting and potentially less link-editing operations, thus render-
ing factual content especially contested. Conversely, high-quality articles show the largest
amount of format actions. This increased amount of formatting may relate to the polish-
ing necessary to meet the standards of high-quality content on Wikipedia. We conjecture
that the differing editing behavior of conflicted content influences link structure, and vice
versa. Consequentially, we find that edit war articles are clear outliers in several standard
network measures, with controversial articles also bearing clear differences to low- or
high-quality articles. Particularly, edit war articles have, on average, significantly higher
in-degree, out-degree, PageRank, and k-core in contrast to a lower reciprocity, clustering
coefficient, and average path length. In addition, betweenness results of disputed articles
suggest their location in structural holes of the wikilink network, supposedly taking on

Ruprechter et al. Applied Network Science (2020) 5:61 Page 3 of 20

a brokerage role between densely clustered article subgroups, topics, and corresponding
editor communities. Furthermore, the distribution of network metric quantities differs
substantially from non-conflicted articles in both moments and shape, with shape fre-
quently taking on non-typical forms for such a Web-based editing processes. Overall,
computed metrics suggest considerable differences of controversial and edit war articles
in comparison to low- and high-quality content on Wikipedia.

With our work, we provide practical contributions for Wikipedia’s community. Firstly,
we depict a clear trend in semantic edit intentions and the occurring disparities in the
underlying link structure of different article categories. Secondly, we demonstrate the
usefulness of these article features as indicators of quality, controversy, and edit wars via
logistic regression. These results may inform further development of existing Wikipedia
content-assessment tools such as Huggle,* Contropedia (Borra et al. 2015), and ORES
(Halfaker et al. 2018). Moreover, we facilitate new solutions for problems such as editor
role identification in Wikipedia or other online collaboration systems through our find-
ings on semantic edit labels. Additionally, our approach quantitatively outmatches similar
studies which apply semantic labeling of Wikipedia edits (Daxenberger and Gurevych
2012; Yang et al. 2016). On top of that, we suggest a novel way of interpreting the attrac-
tion of editors to contentious content on Wikipedia based on network metrics. Altogether,
this work proposes a practical framework which combines Wikipedia editing behavior,
article quality, edit wars, controversial articles, and wikilink structure to extend these sep-
arate lines of inquiry. Our base methods can be readily applied to similar domains, as we

make our code available on GitHub.”

Controversy, conflict, and edit wars on Wikipedia. In the context of Wikipedia, the
terms controversy, conflict, edit wars, and vandalism are sometimes used interchangeably,
despite their actual meaning being fairly different. Firstly, conflict and controversy do not
inherently resemble destructive behavior on Wikipedia (Kittur et al. 2007). In fact, rea-
sonable controversies over contested knowledge have quite the opposite effect. Diverse
points of view seem to foster knowledge generation and even increase quality of arti-
cles (Shi et al. 2019). Recently, researchers studied the relation between editing behavior,
content quality, and conflict via editor collaboration patterns (Arazy et al. 2011; Lerner
and Lomi 2019; 2020). Within this scope, (Lerner and Lomi 2020) analyzed positive
and negative relations between editors to investigate the creation process of controversial
articles.

In order to further quantify effects of controversy and conflict, previous work intro-
duced corresponding metrics (Borra et al. 2015; Fléck et al. 2017; Yasseri et al. 2014).
Contrarily to conflict and controversy, vandalism and edit wars distinctively represent
destructive behavior on Wikipedia (Adler et al. 2011; Potthast et al. 2008). Automatically
detecting vandalistic contributions and performing counter-vandalism actions on articles
presents a well-developed research area (Adler et al. 2011; Halfaker et al. 2018; Kumar et
al. 2015). Similarly, broad research exists about edit war prediction in Wikipedia articles
(Sumi et al. 2011; Yasseri et al. 2012). Multiple authors proposed using mutual reverts of
Wikipedia revisions as detectors of this behavior (Gandica et al. 2014; Yasseri and Kertész

 

“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Huggle
°https://github.com/ruptho/editlinkquality- wikipedia
Ruprechter et al. Applied Network Science (2020) 5:61 Page 4 of 20

2013). Mutual reverts occur when two editors revert each other’s revisions. Controversy
metrics based solely on mutual reverts detect vandalism and edit wars very well.

In contrast to mutual reverts, we use granular edit actions as well as network metrics to

analyze and predict controversial and edit war articles. We believe that considering all edit
actions could improve prevalent detection mechanisms and extend existing understand-
ing of controversy and edit wars on Wikipedia. In addition, predicting potential future
conflicts arising due to an article’s location in the Wikipedia hyperlink network could be
important for quality assurance and conflict moderation. Considering these conjectures,
we explore the role of arbitrary edit actions and network properties in controversies and
edit wars on Wikipedia.
Wikipedia networks. In past research, researchers frequently analyzed collaboration
and social structure in Wikipedia editor networks, as well as their effect on article qual-
ity (Brandes et al. 2009; De La Robertie et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015; Liu and Ram 2018;
Platt and Romero 2018). In studies on Wikipedia hyperlink networks, authors investi-
gated link structure to leverage semantic (Milne and Witten 2008), topical (Coursey and
Mihalcea 2009), or categorical (Suchecki et al. 2012) information. Dimitrov et al. (2017)
explored link success and found that users seem to frequently choose links leading to
target Wikipedia articles less prominent than the source article, or to one with a similar
topic. In another line of work, authors discovered that featured articles are “more central”
than others in specific Wikipedia language editions, depicted by their lower clustering
coefficient and shorter average path length (Ingawale et al. 2013). This finding supports
the general theory by Burt (2001) that nodes spanning structural holes of a network act
as brokers of information and profit from their position between different communi-
ties or groups. Such nodes benefit from access to information and knowledge which are
not universally accessible, as resources circulate between groups through structural holes
(Burt 1992). By the same token, (Granovetter 1973) argues that weak ties between nodes
carry novel information, while strong ties most likely only transfer information familiar
to the involved nodes. Although (Burt 1992) and (Granovetter 1973) base these theories
on social networks, we argue that similar effects are applicable to information networks
such as Wikipedia, as articles spanning structural holes connect topical subgroups. Other
authors suggested that in the Wikipedia network out-degree correlates with quality, in-
degree with popularity, and PageRank with importance for the Portuguese Wikipedia —
although correlation was generally weak for quality and importance, while being mod-
erate for popularity (Hanada et al. 2013). In 2009, a study provided information about
general network metrics for Wikipedia, claiming that median values for article in- and
out-degree were 4 and 12, while average degree was 20.63 (Kamps and Koolen 2009). On
a completely different note, article pages contain text links created by human editors as
well as links generated by templates. To solely focus on editor-created links, (Consonni et
al. 2019) proposed the WikiLinkGraphs dataset, which only includes wikilinks in article
texts and excludes automatically generated links.

Extending those studies, we provide novel findings about internal Wikipedia links to
unravel relations between article hyperlinks, quality, and potential conflicts.

Wikipedia editing behavior. When investigating editing behavior in a general context,
researchers formerly proposed multiple edit label taxonomies, considering both semantic
and syntactic changes. Early works differentiate edits which either change (“Text-Base”)
or preserve (“Surface”) the meaning of texts (Faigley and Witte 1981). Later, authors
Ruprechter et al. Applied Network Science (2020) 5:61 Page 5 of 20

introduced more sophisticated label taxonomies, adapted to the context of Wikipedia
(Antin et al. 2012; Daxenberger and Gurevych 2012; Habernal et al. 2016; Yang et al.
2016) or other online collaboration systems such as StackOverflow (Yang et al. 2014). In
2016, the Wikimedia foundation deployed an experimental three-level taxonomy for arti-
cle edits,° which is structured into 14 semantic intentions, 18 syntactic elements, and
three editor actions (Yang et al. 2017). We apply an edit action classification approach
which adapts this taxonomy’s 14 semantic edit labels.

Altogether, we extend existing literature on editing behavior and edit wars on Wikipedia
by analyzing the triplet of semantic edit actions, Wikipedia network structure, and article

quality.

Materials and methods

Background and preliminaries

Namespaces. Wikipedia organizes pages into numbered namespaces. In this work, we
focus on analyzing pages in namespace 0 (“ns0”) of the English Wikipedia, which repre-
sents all article pages. We ignore content in other namespaces, for example article talk
(“ns1”) or user pages (“ns2”).

Revisions, edits, wikilinks. Human editors generate most article contents on Wikipedia.
Both registered and unregistered editors perform changes to articles via revisions (Sage
Ross 2014). Each revision consists of edits which either insert, modify, or delete content
of articles. While editing, editors create hyperlinks to other Wikipedia articles (i.e., wik-
ilinks) as well as external pages. Wikilinks add useful context for readers and connect
articles into a Wikipedia hyperlink network, enabling readers to follow the flow of topical
or categorical information on Wikipedia.

Content assessment on wikipedia. Wikipedia establishes article ratings using a well-
defined content assessment system’. This system allows for assessment of articles
according to quality and importance. In this work, we focus on article quality as the main
distinguishing factor for articles. Wikipedia defines concise guidelines for assessing article
quality. Quality assessments of articles range from highest to lowest, including: Featured
(FA), A-class (A), Good (GA), B-Class (B), C-class (C), Start, and Stub articles. Start and
Stub pages usually represent newly created or very short articles. For our analysis, we
ignore such articles due to their very low quality and in many cases short revision history.
In addition, Featured List (FL) and List pages exist, in which listed items represent links
to articles and include supplemental information. We also exclude FL and List articles
from our analysis because of their peculiar content structure, which is atypical for regular
articles.

Wikipedia derives quality ratings from tags applied by users of separate WikiProjects.®
While articles usually have different ratings across various WikiProjects, the final assess-
ment for an article is determined by its best rating over all WikiProjects. For example, as
of June 2019 the Wikipedia article about the Austrian city Graz’ is rated C by “WikiPro-
ject Cities” but B by “WikiProject Austria’, thus producing a B rating overall. However,
the highest-quality content on Wikipedia, such as GA and FA, must be approved sepa-
rately through a review process. During this review, several editors assess factors such as

articles without assessment. Table 1 summarizes Wikipedia quality assessment data as of

Dataset
We utilize the Wikimedia API RevScoring!! to process revisions. RevScoring is an auto-
matic revision scoring system developed as the library powering the Wikimedia service
ORES (Halfaker et al. 2018). ORES is a tool developed by the Wikimedia foundation which
enables automatic assessment of quality and importance of Wikipedia pages as well as
individual article revisions.

For our dataset, we retrieve and process a total of 4941 articles. First of all, we collect
revision histories of articles deemed to be especially controversial or contain edit wars.
We therefore sample a total of 1 000 articles from the following sources:

I) “Most conflicted” articles. A sample of 450 articles deemed most conflicted by
metrics calculated using the TokTrack dataset (Flock et al. 2017).

II) “Most controversial” articles. Yasseri et al. (2014) collected 100 of the most
controversial articles for ten Wikipedia language editions based on mutual reverts
of revisions, from which we gather those in the English Wikipedia.

Ill) “Lamest Edit Wars” on Wikipedia.!? We extract 50 articles from this short list of
prominent edit war articles on Wikipedia, including edit wars about ethnicity and
nationality, politics and religion, or spelling.

IV) “List of Controversial Issues” on Wikipedia.!° These articles are monitored
because they are subject to constant circular re-editing due to their controversial

content. We retrieve 400 articles from this list.

After removal of duplicates (article names present in multiple lists), 941 articles remain:
401 “most conflicted” articles, 94 “most controversial” articles, 50 “Lamest Edit Wars’, and
396 articles from the “List of Controversial Issues” The first three lists contain 545 articles
that have been classified as conflicted either via edit-based metrics such as mutual reverts
(Lists I and II) or manual detection of edit warring (List III). We combine these three arti-
cle lists into a category which we term “Edit Wars” (EW). Besides, we treat List IV, which
represents articles about controversial issues (CI), as a separate category. These 396 man-
ually labeled articles contain contentious topics, which embody societally divisive issues
instead of merely disputes between specific editors (Lerner and Lomi 2020). Afterwards,

we retrieve and process revision histories of a sample of 800 articles per Wikipedia quality

category (FA, A, GA, B and C) with more than 50 revisions. We combine FA, A, and GA
into a collection of high-quality articles (HQ), while merging B and C into a low-quality
category (LQ). For our analysis, we consider LQ, HQ, EW, and CI articles, thus resulting
in a dataset of 4941 revision histories.

Labeling edit actions on Wikipedia

Edit actions. To label edit actions, we adopt a multi-label classification approach. For
robust labeling of the edit actions we start with the 14-label'* taxonomy proposed by
Yang et al. (2016) and combine those 14 labels into three super-labels: Content, Format,
and WikiContext. Firstly, the Content label captures all edits aiming towards modifying
actual information on the article page. It combines fact-updates, simplification, elab-
oration, clarification, increasing verifiability, and establishing a neutral point of view.
Secondly, the Format label describes all editing actions not changing the meaning of
texts, facts, or contained information. This includes refactoring, copy-editing, manipu-
lating wikilinks and wiki markup, as well as link disambiguation. Lastly, the WikiContext
label captures all wiki-specific interactions such as modifying processing tags, vandalism,
counter-vandalism, or other intentions.

Classification of edit actions. We retrieve and build the revision feature set for our
multi-label classifier by utilizing most of the framework published alongside the 14-label
taxonomy. We derive features as well as training set from previous work (Yang et al. 2017).
Per revision, we use RevScoring to retrieve 163 base features. These features consist of
text features (e.g., differences in words, punctuation, and numbers), revision data (e.g.,
timestamp and comment), as well as editor information (e.g., user registration date). We
further process this feature set to produce 207 final features for classification. Through
this, we extend the 163 base features by several more advanced text features such as the
number of spelling errors, markup changes, differences in stemmed text in comparison to
the preceding revision, amount of relocated text, and information about special content
such as templates, files, or references.

Our classification training set consists of 5777 manually labeled revisions (Yang et al.
2017). We transform this dataset to fit our three-category taxonomy through aggrega-
tion of edit labels. For this, we transform training labels into corresponding super-labels
(Content, Format, and WikiContext) according to the aforementioned label combina-
tions. Furthermore, we collect additional revision samples for the WikiContext label via
retrieving edits performed by the anti-vandalism bot ClueBotNG.'? The bot’s edits are
categorized as examples of counter-vandalism, while their preceding revisions are classi-
fied as vandalism (0.1% false positive rate). By combining these samples with the training
dataset, we accumulate 6670 multi-label revisions which contain 3497 Format, 2346
Content, and 1641 WikiContext edits.

Finally, to determine a feasible configuration for a multi-label Random Forest classifier
given our training set and features, we apply grid search using a 80—20 train/test split with
10-fold cross validation. We find a suitable configuration (weighted F1 score of 0.8153)
with a parameter setting of 750 estimators, a maximum tree depth of 25, and 50% of
features considered for finding the best split.

Modeling edit action sequences

We characterize editing behavior in Wikipedia articles using two metrics: relative label
frequency and label transition probability.

Relative edit label frequency. We compute relative edit label frequency for each cate-
gory by macro-averaging the relative frequencies of their articles. Accordingly, we first
calculate relative frequency of the automatically created edit labels for all articles. After
that, averaging the article values in each quality category produces the per-category
macro-averages.

Edit label transition probability. For our investigation of label transitions, we compute
first order Markov chains from the automatically labeled article revision histories. Similar
to the computation of relative label frequencies explained above, we accumulate macro-
averaged transition probabilities for all quality categories. Firstly, transition probabilities
are computed from edit label sequences in article revision histories. Subsequently, we
average article results for each quality category to generate per-category label transition
probabilities.

Characterizing differences in categories. To assess statistical significance of differences
in label frequency and transition probability we perform pair-wise permutation tests
(Chandrasekharan et al. 2017; Vautard et al. 1990) between all article categories. These
tests compare the distance of observed category means to category means of randomly
permuted assignments of articles to categories. The null hypothesis for our test states that
values for article subsets drawn from different categories stem from the same probability

distribution.

Network of wikilinks
Wikilink graph. We generate a wikilink graph by employing the framework used to cre-
ate the WikiLinkGraphs dataset (Consonni et al. 2019). This framework enables graph
generation solely from wikilinks in article texts extracted from Wikipedia XML dumps.!°
We thereby exclude automatically generated links (e.g., via Wikipedia templates) and only
include wikilinks which were intentionally modified by editors. In the resulting graph,
each article is a node and wikilinks between articles are edges. We generate a graph
from Wikipedia dumps for June 2019. In addition, we execute our own post-processing
pipeline, which removes nodes modeling redirects between Wikipedia articles (i.e., nodes
with a single outgoing link) and resolves duplicate article titles. For the English Wikipedia
article namespace, the graph contains 5 879 005 articles connected by 163 526 307 wik-
ilinks. The largest strongly connected component holds 5 241 679 nodes and 155 056 731
edges.

The resulting WikiLinkGraphs dataset misses 59 (3 LQ, 20 HQ, 11 EW, 25 CI) of our
4.941 investigated articles, caused by invalid redirects or broken wikilinks.
Network metrics. We investigate our wikilink network via typical parsimonious net-
work metrics and calculate empirical complementary cumulative distribution functions
(CCDF) of in-degree (deg’), out-degree (deg*), PageRank (PR) (Page et al. 1999), reci-
procity (r) (Garlaschelli and Loffredo 2004), directed clustering coefficient (CC) (Watts
and Strogatz 1998), and k-core (Shin et al. 2016).

Results and discussion

Relative edit label frequency

Results. We show results for category-wise relative label frequencies in Fig. la. We
exclude results for any label combination besides Content and Format, due to their
extremely low relative frequency (< 0.0004). Furthermore, we introduce a label class
termed “NoLabel” to encompass revisions where our classifier could either not assign a
definite label, which were deleted, or where other inconsistencies occurred.

We find several substantial disparities between various article categories. Relative edit
label frequency for EW deviates considerably from LQ and HQ, while also exhibiting
slight differences to CI for some labels. Revisions for articles in EW contain on average
38.4% Format (which includes wikilink manipulations), 26.6% Content, 14.8% WikiCon-
text, 10% Content and Format, and 10.2% NoLabel edits. Cl article histories mostly show
similar edit label frequencies, although they generate moderately fewer WikiContext
(11.3%), which includes vandalism, in favor of more Format edits (42.1%). Alternatively,
HQ (53.4%) is the overall highest-scoring category for Format, somewhat ahead of LQ
(51.4%). As opposed to the lower Format score, LQ articles are subject to relatively greater
amounts of Content and NoLabel edits than HQ (23.9% and 7.1% versus 22.3% and 5.8%,
respectively). Considering WikiContext edits, EW and CI revisions contain significantly
more such modifications than non-conflicted categories (< 6% for LQ and HQ). On top of
that, EW and CI exhibit substantially greater amounts of Content (26.6% and 26.8%) and
NoLabel (10.2% and 9.5%) editing. Overall, we conclude that relative edit label frequen-
cies for EW and CI differ considerably from LQ and HQ. Results for EW and CI deviate

(a) Relative frequency (b) Transition probability
Fig. 1 Relative frequency and transition probability for edit labels. In Fig. 1a, we visualize relative label
frequencies by article category (bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals). EW articles are subject to the least
amount of Format edits and are most likely to receive WikiContext edits, marking them significantly dissimilar
from non-conflicted LQ and HO articles. Results for Cl yield similar effects as EW, although differences to LQ
and HQ are not as considerable. Figure 1b shows transition probabilities between edit labels per article
category. Most notably, EW and Cl article histories contain fewer successive Format edits and less formatting
in general than those in LO or HQ. EW and Cl also exhibit a greater probability for consecutive Content or
WikiContext edits

slightly from each other for Format and WikiContext. At the same time, we observe scarce
dissimilarities between LQ and HQ.

Permutation tests for relative frequencies reveal statistically significant differences

across all article categories (py < 0.01 after Bonferroni correction), except for Content as
well as combined Content and Format edits for EW versus CI.
Discussion. Relative frequencies of edit actions in conflicted EW and CI articles follow
significantly different patterns than non-conflicted articles in LQ and HQ. The increased
frequencies for Content, WikiContext, or NoLabel indicate editors regularly rewriting
EW and Cl articles. This behavior possibly hints towards the high potential contentious-
ness of the content. In general, NoLabel edits signal that a revision contains atypical
content, such as ASCII art,!’ or that it was removed by administrators. Therefore, we
argue that EW’s high number of NoLabel edits is a by-product of increased vandalism.
When comparing articles according to quality, HQ’s peak in formatting frequency exem-
plifies editor efforts to create content which complies with the standards of high-quality
articles on Wikipedia. LQ shows similar patterns as HQ across all edit labels, although
differences are still significant. Altogether, our results confirm that content is signifi-
cantly more conflicted in EW and CI. On the one hand, conflicts about facts can lead
to increased article quality. On the other hand, frequent editor conflict might also raise
the possibility of destructive behavior. In contrast to frequent content editing, we detect
a substantially lower amount of formatting actions in EW and CI than LQ and HQ,
potentially indicating less link-editing operations.

Label transition probabilities
Results. We present label transition probabilities in Fig. 1b, which unveils that probabili-
ties for LQ and HQ are rather different from EW and CI. Particularly, results for HQ show
the highest probability of consecutive Format actions (0.609), followed by LQ (0.577). Suc-
cessive Format edits occur less frequently in EW (0.512) and CI (0.525). In general, EW
and CI produce fewer transitions involving Format than LQ and HQ. By contrast, EW and
CI more strongly lean towards sequences containing Content, NoLabel, and WikiCon-
text, making their revision histories highly dissimilar from LQ and HQ. The most notable
difference between EW and CI is marked by articles in EW generating slightly more tran-
sitions ending in WikiContext edits. On the whole, these findings principally corroborate
the difference of EW and CI to LQ and HQ as depicted in the relative label frequencies.
Permutation test results in Fig. 2 largely confirm a statistically significant difference
of EW and CI to LQ and HQ (p < 0.002 after Bonferroni correction). Test results also
highlight the similarity between EW and CI, as well as LQ and HQ.
Discussion. Transition probabilities for LQ and HQ suggest that editors more strongly
focus on content formatting in these non-conflicted articles. As for quality, the consider-
ably higher probabilities for consecutive Format edits in HQ may stem from such articles
representing some of the highest-quality Wikipedia content. Due to Wikipedia's policies
for high-quality content, these articles often undergo phases of intensive formatting when
considered for promotion to featured or good articles, which we collected in HQ. This
process further explains why LQ articles contain less Format transitions than those in HQ.
Contrarily, EW and CI are characterized by higher Content, WikiContext, or NoLabel

probabilities, which possibly infer content disputes among editors. Such detection of
conspicuous interaction patterns could potentially be adopted to warn administrators of
conflicts arising in specific articles. Besides, our approach of collecting behavioral infor-
mation could be leveraged for editor role identification or similar applications benefiting
from semantic edit labels.

Network of wikilinks

Results. As we visualize in Fig. 3, EW and CI exhibit fairly different CCDFs than LQ and
HQ for multiple standard network metrics. At the same time, EW articles produce the
most extreme values, usually followed closely by CI, with HQ and LQ trailing behind. Our
results for EW indicate that mean deg’, deg’, PR, and k-core are substantially higher, while
r and CC are lower than for other categories. Firstly, non-conflicted articles in LQ and
HQ rarely have a deg’ of more than 5 000, while over 30% of EW articles do (Fig. 3a). Sec-
ondly, we also observe a higher average deg* for EW, although the effect is not as extreme
as for deg’ (Fig. 3b). Thirdly, the majority of our non-conflicted articles has extremely low
PR, leading to hardly any articles reaching a value of 5 - 10~°, while over 20% of those in
EW and close to 10% in CI have a higher PR than that (Fig. 3c). Next, even though mean
r is lower for EW than for other categories the difference is small, especially in compari-
son to CI (Fig. 3d). LQ and HQ results depict somewhat higher average r. Furthermore,
over 95% of EW and CI articles have a CC lower than 0.075 (Fig. 3e). In contrast, LQ
and HQ reach considerably higher CC with CCDFs being quite alike for both categories.

Fig. 3 CCDFs of parsimonious network metrics across article categories, with insets highlighting relevant
chart areas. In all CCDFs, results for EW stand out, with Cl being most similar to EW. Both categories differ

substantially from LQ and HQ. We find that, on average, deg’ (Fig. 3a), deg* (Fig. 3b), and PR (Fig. 3c) are
considerably higher, while r (Fig. 3d) and CC (Fig. 3d) are seemingly lower for EW and Cl than for LO and HQ.

 

 

Additionally, we attribute the higher k-core numbers (Fig. 3f) to their correlation with degree (Shin et al. 2016)

 

Moreover, computed k-core numbers indicate that a large number of EW articles (150)
is grouped in a connected subgraph in which all vertices have a degree of at least 141 —
a higher amount than for all other categories (Fig. 3f). Altogether, we conclude that EW
articles show substantially different results for the considered network metrics. Results for
CI generally follow similar trends as EW and mostly constitute values in between results
of EW and LQ or HQ. In addition, high-quality articles regularly seem close to low-quality
articles in terms of CCDFs.

We consequently perform pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests between all categories and
metrics for the difference in median. We report statistically significant differences of EW
and CI to LQ and HQ for all metrics after Bonferroni correction (p < 8.33 - 107-4). EW
and CI show significant differences for all metrics besides Cr’. LQ and HQ test results
are significant for all metrics but deg, CC, and cee,

Discussion. EW articles exhibit, on average, higher deg and PR, signaling frequent refer-
ral from other (or more prominent) articles. CI also shows higher values for these metrics
than LQ and HQ, although results are not as protruding as for EW. Consequentially, EW
and Cl articles possibly “attract more attention” than others due to them being in the spot-
light. Increased public exposure may lead to a boost in popularity and, as a result, edit
wars and controversy. A rapid increase in in-links might therefore signal an article gain-
ing traction due to a recent event or current news. This could possibly be interpreted as a
“warning signal” by administrators. It might be feasible to start monitoring or even semi-
protect!® such content to potentially prevent edit wars. Furthermore, we observe lower
CC for EW and CI, which could be the consequence of such content being relevant to
multiple diverse, closer connected article subgroups. For example, controversial articles
such as “United States’, “Vladimir Putin’, and “World War II” connect different topical

categories on Wikipedia, acting as information brokers between different communities
interested in these articles. Considering previous findings about conflict on Wikipedia,
this might be a peculiarity of the English language version, where broader topics are more
contested (Yasseri et al. 2014). Apparently, the English version merges contributions of
people with differing origin and background, thus generating conflict and edit wars —
an effect which is not as prevalent for non-English Wikipedia. However, this may also
be explained by the negative correlation of clustering coefficient and degree (Ravasz and
Barabasi 2003).

To shed light on the role of EW and CI articles as connectors of topical subgroups
on Wikipedia, we further investigate these articles’ network properties. We argue that
conflicted articles might frequently be located in structural holes of the wikilink net-
work. Theoretically, articles which span structural holes (Burt 2001) or resemble local
bridges (Granovetter 1973) act as brokers of information, thus fitting the characteristics
of EW and CI that we hypothesize. We assess these characteristics by computing further
network metrics for our 4.941 articles, in particular average path length (/) (Albert and
Barabasi 2002) as well as three betweenness metrics: betweenness centrality in the whole
graph (Cg) (Brandes 2001), betweenness centrality of the article ego network (CR”), and

a local approximation of betweenness centrality (ck). For each article a, Chee measures
the ratio of the number of shortest paths between neighbors of a that actually go through
a to the total number of paths between neighbors going through a.

Figure 4 visualizes CCDFs for the computed centrality metrics, seemingly supporting
our assumptions about controversial and edit war articles’ possible location in structural
holes. Firstly, EW articles are more central than articles in other categories according to
the substantially higher Cg (Fig. 4a). CI articles on average also show moderate Cg, thus
assuming a more central position than LQ and HQ, which exhibit extremely low values.
Although following a different distribution, the CCDF for Cr shows about 80% of EW
and CI articles holding a higher value than 0.3, with LQ and HQ bearing lower values
(Fig. 4b). Interestingly, LQ has a higher average Cr” than HQ, suggesting that high-quality
articles are the least central. This finding is supported by results for chee, which acts as
a counterpart to CC. HQ articles’ lower cee indicates that high-quality articles lie on
less shortest paths between their neighbors in comparison to LQ or EW and CI (Fig. 4c).
Furthermore, Cee seems to confirm centrality of EW and Cl articles. Lastly, / is somewhat
lower for EW (4.20) and CI (4.31) than HQ (4.47) and LQ (4.54) in Fig. 4d.

Collectively, centrality findings indicate that controversial and edit war articles are
indeed frequently located in structural holes of the wikilink network, acting as brokers
of information between topical subgroups and different-minded communities. Previous
research of structural holes in Wikipedia attributed such a brokerage role to high-quality
articles (especially featured articles), arguing that their ability to broker information
increases article quality (Ingawale et al. 2013). Our findings tend to object this character-
istic of high-quality content, suggesting considerably higher centrality and shorter average
path length for CI and EW articles. However, since we combine good, A-class, and fea-
tured articles in HQ, the characteristics might still be prevalent for featured articles alone.
Therefore, it appears that brokerage of information across structural holes in a Wikipedia
network could be regarded as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, quality of arti-
cles in structural holes benefits from a large variety of information sources, because of

their connections to multiple strongly tied article subgroups. On the other hand, content
of such article subgroups usually concerns specific topical or cultural information, thus
engaging corresponding communities and increasing polarization (Shi et al. 2019). Either
way, our results suggest that controversial and edit war articles hold a particular role as
brokers of information between communities in the Wikipedia network.
Relation of network properties, quality, and conflict. In previous work, authors fre-
quently utilized mutual reverts (or similar metrics) as indicators of conflict and edit wars.
However, our dataset suggests that such conflict metrics appear to favor articles with a
larger number of revisions, considerably differing from those in Wikipedia lists of edit
wars and controversial topics. While articles listed on Wikipedia as “Lamest edit wars”
and in the “List of controversial issues” average about 5000 and 4300 revisions, the
most conflicted articles according to researchers’ metrics average approximately 9 300
and 14 200 revisions (Fléck et al. 2017; Yasseri et al. 2014). This disparity is important for
our analysis, since higher revision counts typically increase article length, which in turn
correlates with network properties such as degree (Lamprecht et al. 2016).

To account for these correlations and to better estimate underlying relations between
network metrics, quality, controversy, and edit wars we estimate a logistic regression
model at article level with article category as the dependent and the given network met-

rics as independent variables. For this, we perform binary one-versus-one classification
Ruprechter et al. Applied Network Science (2020) 5:61 Page 15 of 20

experiments for all category combinations with the category labels as dependent vari-
ables. Additionally, we include deg’, deg’, due to the prevalent correlation with network
metrics, for example clustering coefficient (Ravasz and Barabasi 2003). We apply logistic
regression with robust variable scaling and L1 regularization.

Table 2 lists the coefficients of network metrics for this logistic regression. Firstly,
all coefficients for LQ versus HQ exhibit statistical significance (p < 0.05), marking
low-quality and high-quality articles significantly different in all investigated network
aspects. Furthermore, HQ and CI show significant differences for the regression inter-
cept, deg", Nyey, k-core, and chee, which is aligned with the highest network metric
coefficient. When comparing HQ to EW, we identify significance for the network met-
rics deg’, deg’, Nyrey, Cg, and Chee, Finally, EW appears to be significantly different from
CI for deg* and nyey. This might support the supposition that edit war articles may
be of greater length due to a higher revision count, and thus contain more outgoing
links. We note that further correlation of specific network metrics, for example CC
and Cee (Spearman’s 9 = —0.93), could skew p-value results. Accordingly, we remove
Chee from the regression and repeat our experiments. This renders CC a statistically
significant predictor (p < 0.05) for regressions in which the coefficient for Chee was sig-
nificant before. We omit the recomputed result table for the sake of brevity. Note that
we counter other multi-collinearity issues with L1 regularization. Overall, this logistic
regression illustrates the relation of network metrics, article quality, controversy, and edit

wars.

Prediction of article category via computed metrics

We now illustrate a practical application of our empirical results via a series of logis-
tic prediction experiments. These experiments utilize the computed editing and network
features to predict our article categories, which take the dimensions of article quality and
conflict into account. For the experiments, we divide our collected article features into

five feature sets:

edits which were not classified with a definite label (NoLabel).

e Label Transition Probabilities (LT). Transition probabilities for all possible label
combinations besides transitions from and to article edits which could not be
definitely classified (NoLabel).

Using these feature sets, we perform binary classification via logistic regression with
robust variable scaling and L1 regularization. We carry out binary one-versus-one as well
as one-versus-all classification for all category combinations. We evaluate our regression
results using 10-fold cross validation and report the ROC-AUC score.

For one-versus-one classification (Table 3), using only 1, as a prediction variable per-
forms exceptionally well for all logistic regressions, especially for those involving EW.
Regressions for LQ or HQ versus EW which utilize only 1,¢, achieve respective ROC-AUC
scores of 0.968 and 0.961. We explain these particularly strong results by the previously
elaborated bias of conflict metrics towards the number of revisions. Extending these pre-
dictors with all other features improves classification performance even further (0.996
and 0.997), marking EW easily distinguishable from LQ and HQ. ROC-AUC for CI versus
LQ or HQ is slightly lower (0.973 and 0.984). In addition, ROC-AUC scores are some-
what lower for CI versus EW (0.879) and LQ versus HQ (0.805) when using all feature
sets. Consequently, our experiments suggest that LQ and HQ are the hardest categories to
differentiate. We explain this fact by the overlap of general characteristics between non-
conflicted articles. The lower ROC-AUC for CI versus EW may therefore imply a similar
overlap for controversial and edit war articles. Although these findings seem to indicate
a partial inability to predict quality, they also demonstrate that non-conflicted articles
are adequately distinguishable from conflicted ones via regression. When employing sin-
gle feature sets, all regressions using only CV (deg’, deg*, and nye,) perform remarkably.
However, solely utilizing NM, LF, or LT also yields ROC-AUC scores reaching over 75%
of the best respective scores. Furthermore, combining editing behavior features (LF and
LT) outperforms network features for one-versus-one regression.

From Table 4 we conclude that one-versus-all classification results follow similar trends
as those for one-versus-one classification. Most notably, the regression for EW versus all
other articles exhibits the highest ROC-AUC (0.986), followed by CI (0.888), HQ (0.853),
and LQ (0.823). This further highlights EW’s difference to the rest of the investigated
content. CI appears to be fairly distinguishable from other categories as well, although
classification performance is moderately worse. All in all, these experiments demonstrate
the prediction of article categories characterized by quality, controversy, and edit wars via
editing behavior and network features.

Conclusion
In this work, we showed that controversial and edit war articles significantly differ from
non-conflicted low- and high-quality articles on Wikipedia, both in regard to editing

as well as linking behavior. We further observed a strong similarity between edit war
articles and articles about controversial issues for most of our measurement metrics.
First of all, our findings for relative label frequencies and label transition probabilities
indicated substantial editor disputes over content in conflicted articles. We argue that
this makes editing behavior in such articles vastly different from regular content, which

Table 4 Logistic Regression Results: One-Versus-All Classification. ROC-AUC scores for one-versus-all
logistic regression experiments for all categories. Feature sets consist of the number of revisions
(Nev), control variables (CV), network metrics (NM), label frequencies (LF), and label transition
probabilities (LT). Utilizing all feature sets performs best for all experiments

samples. Additionally, considering more sophisticated classification methods or label
taxonomies could improve results. Nonetheless, we demonstrated feasibility of deriving
semantic editing behavior from article revision histories, which may prove helpful to
existing issues such as editor role identification on Wikipedia. In view of the discovered
disparities in wikilink structure of different article categories, we proposed utilization of
network metrics for detection of conflict or controversy. Our computed network met-
rics also depicted significant differences in the link structure of low- and high-quality
articles. Notwithstanding that we addressed apparent relations between network metrics,
further debiasing existing correlations may improve classification performance. More-
over, we elaborated the effect that articles containing edit wars or controversial issues are
not only more frequently referred to from other articles, but may also act as connectors
between topical subgroups due to their occupation of structural holes in the Wikipedia
network. Momentousness of this effect could be explored in more detail by employing the
Wikipedia clickstream dataset,!? which provides wikilink browsing data extracted from
Wikipedia logs. Finally, we combined findings about editing behavior and network met-
rics to highlight the potential of distinguishing low-quality articles, high-quality articles,
articles about controversial issues, and edit war articles using a logistic regression clas-
sifier. As opposed to the English Wikipedia, the exact nature of quality, controversy, and
conflict in general subjects in other language editions is still an open research question,
thus making a similar analysis of non-English Wikipedia an interesting avenue for future
research.
