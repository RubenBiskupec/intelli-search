haptic feedback system

Abstract

Locomotion is a fundamental human skill. Real-time sensing and feedback is a promising strategy for motion train-
ing to reconstruct healthy locomotion patterns lost due to aging or disease, and to prevent injuries. In this paper, we
present a pilot study on locomotion training via biomechanical modeling and a wearable haptic feedback system.

In addition, a novel simulation framework for motion tracking and analysis is introduced. This unified framework,
implemented within the Unity environment, is used to analyze subject's baseline and performance characteristics,
and to provide real-time haptic feedback during locomotion. The framework incorporates accurate musculoskel-

etal models derived from OpenSim, closed-form calculations of muscle routing kinematics and kinematic Jacobian
matrices, dynamic performance metrics (i.e., muscular effort), human motion reconstruction via inertial measurement
unit (IMU) sensors, and real-time visualization of the motion and its dynamics. A pilot study was conducted in which 6
healthy subjects learned to alter running patterns to lower the knee flexion moment (KFM) through haptic feedback.
We targeted three gait parameters (trunk lean, cadence, and foot strike) that previous studies had identified as having
an influence on reducing the knee flexion moment and associated with increased risk of running injuries. All subjects
were able to adopt altered running patterns requiring simultaneous changes to these kinematic parameters and
reduced their KFM to 30-85% of their baseline values. The muscular effort during motion training stayed comparable
to subjects’ baseline. This study shows that biomechanical modeling, together with real-time sensing and wearable

haptic feedback can greatly increase the efficiency of motion training.

Introduction

Despite the positive health effects, there is a high inci-
dence of lower extremity injuries during running [1, 2].
Although estimates suggest that 10-20% of Americans
run regularly, with 40-50% of these injured annually [3],
causation is more complex, with a survey of results across
17 published studies, involving a range specific popula-
tion characteristics (age, experience, gender, etc.) show-
ing annual injury rates can vary from 19 to 79% [4].

Among these injuries, half occur at the knee joint, with
patellofemoral pain (PFP) being the most common diag-
nosis [2, 4]. PFP can lead to severe pain and disability and
is a precursor of knee osteoarthritis [5].

Joint moments can be used as an indicator of joint load-
ing and have potential application for sports performance
and injury prevention. Peak knee flexion moment and
flexion moment impulse are related to the progression
of patellofemoral joint (PFJ) osteoarthritis [6]. Increased
knee flexion moment is suggestive of greater quadriceps
force requirements and has been reported to result in
higher PFJ reaction force and stress [7, 8].

Real-time feedback is a promising strategy for
motion retraining. Visual or tactile feedback have been

implemented to alter knee and impact loading [9-13].
The use of vibrotactile feedback in several medical and
non-medical areas has been established [14]. Individu-
alized data-driven models were used to train novel gaits
involving a combination of kinematic modifications [15].
In a comparative study by [16], haptic feedback com-
bined with visual feedback yielded better task learning
performance for the lower extremity, compared to visual
feedback or haptic feedback alone. A more recent review
by [17] documented that studies focused on the clinical
applications of wearable feedback for human gait often
used haptic and auditory feedback sensations. Both vis-
ual-auditory feedback and visual-tactile feedback provide
advantages in reducing reaction times and improving
performance [18]. Visual-tactile feedback is more effec-
tive when multiple tasks are performed and cognitive
workload conditions are high [18]. In a study that evalu-
ated assistive navigation systems for the blind, auditory
feedback resulted in a 22 times higher cognitive load than
haptic feedback [19]. Previous studies have observed that
vision feedback provides a high degree of precision [12].
Vibration provides simple and intuitive feedback, par-
ticularly when vision is otherwise occupied [15]. In addi-
tion, vibration conveys Cartesian space directional cues
well.

Haptic feedback is increasingly becoming an essential
component for maximizing the effectiveness of the inter-
action between the human user and a machine. Using
touch to communicate with users, haptic feedback pro-
vides a relative sensation that is important in daily explo-
ration tasks. It can also be a means of delivering cues to a
user learning new motor skills [20] or for patients under-
going rehabilitation therapy [21]. As haptic systems are
being developed as wearable devices, this technology is
finding a surge of applications in healthcare, virtual real-
ity, remote assistance, and robotics [22]. Some common
examples of haptic feedback in everyday life includes the
vibration alerts in a modern smart watch or the resist-
ance given to the driver by the car’s electric power steer-
ing system. There are many different types of haptic
feedback modalities that are used for different tasks and
applications. This paper explores the different modalities
used and discusses the use of vibrotactile feedback dur-
ing locomotion.

During skin stretch, the surface of the haptic device
imparts a shear force on the user’s skin to excite its
mechanoreceptors. By stretching the skin tangentially,
skin-stretch feedback can give directional information
to the user [23]. A study by Norman et al. demonstrates
the effectiveness of a simple fingerpad skin stretch device
to guide a user’s arm via haptic cues and real-time cor-
rective feedback [24]. With the motivation to increase
embodiment between amputees and their prosthetic

Page 2 of 13

device, Battaglia et al. evaluated the ability of a rota-
tional skin-stretch haptic wearable to convey propriocep-
tive information of a robotic hand [25]. For lower limb
amputees, Husman et al. proposes the use of a lateral
skin-stretch haptic wearable to cue the user of gait events
during ambulation [26].

During electrotactile feedback, electric signals stimu-
late nerves in the skin via surface electrodes. The main
benefit of this modality is that there are no moving parts
and it can deliver a variety of different sensations com-
pared to other forms of feedback [27]. An experiment by
Pamungkas et al. describes an electrotactile feedback sys-
tem that conveys surface properties of a remote object to
the back of the user’s hand [28]. Using amplitude mod-
ulated electrotactile feedback to the neck, Arakeri et al.
developed a system that provides information regarding
the grip force and closure of a hand grasping an object
[29].

Vibrotactile feedback is perhaps one of the most com-
monly recognized types of haptic feedback as it is found
in mobile phones and gaming console controllers. Vibro-
tactile actuators become ideal in many haptic applica-
tions due to its low cost, small size, and its ability to be
effective when placed at almost anywhere on the body
[30]. When combined with motion capture technology,
vibrotactile feedback can be used to help students learn
a new motor skill such as playing the violin [20]. More
notably, vibrotactile feedback systems are researched in
areas that would help improve gait performance for the
elderly that suffer from the risk of falling or patients that
experience a functional disability after stroke. A study by
Lee et al. demonstrates the efficacy of vibrotactile cue-
ing to prevent falls using a split-belt treadmill to simulate
unpredictable perturbations [31]. A portable gait asym-
metry rehabilitation system by Azfal et al. delivers vibro-
tactile cues based on gait phase measurement to improve
gait symmetry for individuals with stroke [21, 32]. Two
studies demonstrated that haptic feedback can be used to
identify and retrain gait parameters such as toe-in/toe-
out configuration and stride length during walking [33,
34]. A separate study have shown positive results among
patients who require gait guidance and suffer from gait
abnormality due to lack of balance for rehabilitation [35].

Researchers proposed using multiple haptic modalities
in their device to provide multimodal sensory feedback.
Alonzo et al. proposed stacking vibrotactile stimula-
tors on top of electrotactile stimulators to make the sys-
tem more compact [36]. Another wearable haptic device
could deliver skin-stretch, pressure, and vibrotactile to
convey information about the status of the teleoperated
robot and it has been shown to effectively improve the
user operation performance [37]. Skin stretch is a natural
sensing mode for proprioception, thus making it ideal to
Demircan Robomech J (2020) 7:19

intuitively convey proprioceptive information to the user
[25], even when compared to vibrotactile feedback [38].
As an alert scheme, vibrotactile feedback was found to
be superior to electrotactile feedback in terms of accu-
racy and user comfort [39]. Vibrotactile feedback systems
have also been shown to be an effective and non-invasive
method to convey information or cues that is safer than
electro- and thermal feedback [40].

Computer simulations with accurate musculoskeletal
models can provide detailed insights into the biome-
chanics of walking [41] and running [42] during treat-
ments. In the biomechanics community, highly accurate
human models of lower and upper extremities taken
from cadaveric specimens have been used to investigate
muscle coordination to identify sources of pathological
movement and to establish a scientific basis for treatment
planning and design [43, 44]. Several studies have utilized
biomechanical modeling and dynamic simulations of the
musculoskeletal system to identify the contributors to an
individual gait [45-53]. Metabolic cost models have also
been introduced for the improvement of robotic assis-
tance that considered passive dynamics [54] and fully
actuated systems for human walking [55-58]. OpenSim
[59] is a widely used biomechanical modeling and analy-
sis application that introduced several innovations in:
joint modeling [60], multi-body and contact modeling,
and numerical methods [61] to the biomechanics com-
munity. It provides biologically accurate joint and muscle
models that can be used to create anatomically accurate
musculoskeletal systems. However, since OpenSim uti-
lizes numerical methods to estimate motion dynamics, it
cannot be used to simultaneously track and analyze the
dynamics of motion in real-time.

There exists a plethora of simulation software that
can be used to model and analyze multi-body systems,
some of which are commercially available, while others
are in open source. Current software systems that can
be used to build and analyze human and animal models
include: LifeModeler (commercial) [62], AnyBody (com-
mercial) [63], Visual3D (commercial) [64], SIMM [43],
D-Flow (commercial) [65, 66], V-REP (commercial) [67],
and OpenSim [59] (open source). AnyBody, Visual3D,
and D-Flow are only capable of inverse dynamics. Other
software systems can be used for forward dynamics, but
they require pre-calculated muscle activations, thus lim-
iting their use for predicting patient response to medi-
cal interventions [68]. OpenSim, Anybody, LifeModeler,
and SIMM lack live dynamic simulation capabilities;
they cannot be used to simultaneously track and ana-
lyze motion in real-time. D-Flow, Visual3D, and V-Rep,
although capable of live simulations, are not open source.
Moreover, simulation development within these soft-
ware systems is often cumbersome, and interfacing with

Page 3 of 13

third-party systems (i.e. VR equipment, IMUs, haptic
systems) is not straightforward for the average developer.
Developing a simulation framework within a widely sup-
ported engine, such as Unity or Unreal Engine, would be
much more practical because the resulting products can
be designed to be scalable, highly customizable, easy-to-
use, and open source.

Despite all the recent advances in biomechanics,
robotics, and computer animation research, there is no
established scientific understanding of how real-time
multi-modal feedback integrates into locomotion train-
ing to improve motor learning and performance [14]. In
addition, vibrotactile stimulation as a feedback tool in
sports has not been supported by scientific evidence [14].
Finally, there is no unified and portable framework that
integrates real-time sensing and feedback with human
biomechanical models.

In this paper, we present a pilot study on locomotion
training via a wearable haptic feedback system and the
use of biomechanical modeling. This provide us with
preliminary results to understand the effect of real-time
vibrotactile feedback to elicit motor adaptation in loco-
motion. This work builts upon on our recent results on
human perception accuracy of vibrotactile feedback
during locomotion [69]. In addition, a novel simulation
framework for motion tracking and analysis is intro-
duced. This unified framework, implemented within the
Unity environment, is used to analyze a subject's baseline
and performance characteristics, and to provide real-time
haptic feedback during locomotion. A notable advantage
of building the framework within the Unity environment
is that the user has access to Unity’s extensive Asset Store
[70], which contains a plethora of assets that the user can
integrate with the simulation framework when build-
ing custom motion analysis applications. The framework
incorporates accurate musculoskeletal models derived
from OpenSim, closed-form calculations of muscle rout-
ing kinematics and kinematic Jacobian matrices, dynamic
performance metrics (i.e., muscular effort) [71], human
motion reconstruction via IMU sensors, and real-time
visualization of the motion and its dynamics.

Methods

The following sections present the aim, design, and set-
ting of the study, including the description of the simu-
lation software, motion reconstruction and analysis
methods, subjects and subject preparation, the experi-
mental protocol, the haptic feedback system, and the type
of statistical analysis used.

Software
The simulation framework was developed specifically
to interpret and build OpenSim models within Unity.
Demircan Robomech J (2020) 7:19

The framework implements OpenSim’s musculoskeletal
definitions and incorporates many of OpenSim’s unique
behaviors, such as: conditional muscle path points, mov-
ing muscle path points, cubic spline joint connectivity,
and coordinate coupling constraints. The framework was
also designed to be used within Unity’s editor window in
order to give the user the ability to load and customize
dynamic models while in edit mode. The framework pro-
vides matrix operations and symbolic calculus function-
ality via interprocess communication with MIT’s Math.
NET Symbolics [72], the C++ Mathematical Expression
Toolkit Library (ExprTk) [73], and the ALGLIB numeri-
cal analysis and data-processing library [74]. The inter-
face with Math.NET Symbolics provides the user with
the ability to symbolically calculate the kinematic and
muscular Jacobians of a multi-body model during runt-
ime. The output of the symbolic calculation is a sym-
bolic expression that can be interpreted using ExprTk.
However, symbolic interpretation is computationally
expensive, especially for large expressions (i.e. kinematic
Jacobian). In order to circumvent this problem, we added
dynamic compilation capabilities to the framework that
enables the user to compile symbolic expressions during
runtime and save the output assemblies to disk for future
instances. This runtime-compilation, in combination
with the closed-form symbolic computation provided
by Math.NET Symbolics, is the reason why the frame-
work is able to perform complex dynamic computations
at a simulation frame rate of 100 FPS or higher while
simultaneously tracking motion (using 6 core Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz, 32GB of RAM,
and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti graphics card with 27
GB of GPU memory.). The framework provides a generic
motion tracking interface by implementing the motion
decomposition algorithms from [75-77] to decompose
the transform of a body into the generalized coordi-
nates of a multi-body model. This motion tracking inter-
face is independent of the motion-capture system used
and solely relies on the motion of the body that is being
tracked; this enables the user to use the framework with
pre-constructed humanoid models, which often come
with the Unity packages of motion-capture systems. The
Unity environment provides a framework with the abil-
ity to be interfaced with Unity-compatible, third-party
systems, such as the Oculus Rift [78] and the abovemen-
tioned IMU system. Moreover, the Unity API can be used
alongside the simulation framework to create intuitive
and easily customizable user interfaces that provide the
user with the ability to interact with the loaded multi-
body models. Figure 1 shows the simulation framework
within the Unity environment with real-time motion
reconstruction using the Perception Neuron Pro IMU
motion-capture system [79].

Muscle Jacobian and effort implementation

The ForceSet element of the OpenSim format contains
the definitions of the forces in the model. The OpenSim
format supports various types of forces, such as external
point forces and spring generalized forces [19, 20]. How-
ever, within our framework, only the muscle path actua-
tor type has been implemented. The muscle path actuator
type refers to a force-generating element that applies
controllable tension along a defined geometry path. The
force-generating behavior of this actuator type is defined
by the muscle definitions that derive from it. Each of
these muscle definitions contains a unique definition that
describes the muscle’s force-generating behavior. These
unique definitions are, however, out of the scope of our
framework since the full implementation of the listed
muscle types is currently not part of the framework’s
requirements.

At the current state of our framework, the only ele-
ments that are actively utilized are the “Maxlso-
metricForce’ and “GeometryPath’ elements. ‘The
“MaxlIsometricForce” element is used for the muscle
effort calculations. The “GeometryPath” element con-
tains the path points that the muscle actuator must fol-
low sequentially in every simulation frame as well as the
properties that pertain to the visualization of the muscle
element. Within the framework, the “GeometryPath’” ele-
ment contains the definitions for the muscle actuator’s
“PathPointSet” elements that contain the definitions of
each path point that outlines the geometric path of the
muscle actuator. In accordance to the adopted Open-
Sim format, all the path point types must contain defini-
tions for the path point’s “location” and “body” elements.
The “location” element contains three numerical entries
which refer to the XYZ location (or starting location)
of the path point with respect to the reference frame of
the defined “body” element. The ConditionalPathPoint
and MovingPathPoint types contain additional elements
that must be defined in order to represent their unique
behaviors.

As it pertains to a multibody musculoskeletal model,
the muscle Jacobian represents the muscle moment arm,
which is a measure of the effectiveness of a muscle’s con-
tractual force in generating torque about a given joint
[80]. The Jacobian of a muscle can be calculated by taking
the partial derivatives of the muscle’s total length with
respect to the system’s independent generalized coordi-
nates. For a multi-body system with muscle actuators, the
muscle Jacobian of each muscle can be vertically concat-
enated to represent the system’s muscle Jacobian matrix.
The muscle Jacobian matrix can then be used to relate the
muscle forces to the muscle-induced joint torques along
the system's generalized coordinates by using the rela-
tionship introduced in [80]. Within our framework, all
Demircan Robomech J (2020) 7:19

point-to-point muscle connections are linear; there are
no curved muscle paths. In fact, for muscle wrapping,
the framework uses point-to-point connections between
moving path points and conditional path points to emu-
late a curved path. The framework also assumes that the
length of a muscle is purely kinematic and depends only
on the configuration. It also assumes that the muscle
routing kinematics always take the shortest muscle path
under a given set of muscle via points. Finally, the muscu-
lar effort criterion is implemented as introduced in [80]
using the generalized operational space forces for a given
task and the physiomechanical advantage function [71].
The joint space equation of motion for an open-chain
multi-body system is implemented in the framework.
Modeling the centrifugal and Coriolis terms is compu-
tationally expensive, especially for large multi-body sys-
tems. For this reason, the Coriolis and centrifugal terms
are currently not implemented within the framework.
The gravity, mass matrix, and generalized coordinate
derivative terms are, on the other hand, implemented.

Motion tracking and reconstruction
Within our framework, a generic interface was imple-
mented [81] by developing a motion-tracking element

that decomposes the transform of any referenced object
into the generalized coordinate values required to actu-
ate the imitating “Joint” or “Body” element towards the
transform of the referenced object. The referenced object
can be a hierarchy of objects. In this case, the transform
that the motion-tracking element will try to decompose
is the transform of the last element in the object hier-
archy with respect to the frame of the root object. The
motion-tracking element is characterized as generic
because it does not depend on the type of motion capture
system that is being used; it depends solely on the trans-
form of the object that it is tracking. This characteristic is
valuable because most motion capture system companies
that provide interfaces between their devices and Unity
also provide a rigged humanoid model that can simply
be dragged and dropped into the Unity environment and
work with the motion capture system out of the box. The
limbs of the humanoid model can then be assigned to the
appropriate motion-tracking elements, which in turn fol-
low the translation and orientation of the assigned limbs
without being directly connected to the motion capture
system. Within the our framework, the generic motion-
tracking element is represented by the JointTracker class.
The transform decomposition is achieved by extracting
Demircan Robomech J (2020) 7:19

the translational and rotational components of a refer-
enced object’s transform and then projecting those com-
ponents onto the generalized coordinates of the body
that is trying to imitate the referenced object’s transform.

In order to evaluate the performance of the Joint-
Tracker element, Perception Neuron full-body IMU suit
was integrated into the framework. As expected, Noi-
tom already provides the software (Axis Neuron) and the
rigged humanoid model required to use the IMU motion
capture system within Unity. As designed, the only task
that must be completed to use the IMU motion capture
system with the our framework is to connect the indi-
vidual limbs of the humanoid model to the appropriate
JointTracker elements. The ground reaction forces are
estimated by our framework using the motion data from
IMU and the subject-specific mass matrix. Both the kin-
ematic and kinetic values estimated by our framework
were validated against the data reported in the literature
[6].

Haptic feedback system

We used miniature soft-mounted (i.e., vibrotactile)
actuators [82—84] to ensure light haptic devices did not
impede the natural motions of the human body where
they are mounted. The vibration signals were generated
as follows: (1) “continuous” vibration (500 ms) and (2)
five “discrete” pulses (100 ms) [85]. The feedback pat-
terns were randomly spaced out by 5s, 10s, and 15s. The
torso feedback was in the form of continuous vibrations
on the upper back or staggered vibrations on the lower
back. The subject was instructed to lean forward while
they experience continuous vibrations on the upper back
and lean back when they experienced staggered vibra-
tions on the lower back while they were running. The
knee feedback was in the form of continuous or staggered
vibrations on the lateral knee joints. The subject was
instructed to increase cadence when they experienced
continuous vibrations and reduce cadence when they
experienced staggered vibrations while they were run-
ning. The ankle feedback was in the form of continuous
or staggered vibrations on the lateral ankle joints. The
subject was instructed to increase foot-drop angle when
they experienced continuous vibrations and reduce foot-
drop angle when they experienced staggered vibrations
while they were running. The technical specifications
of the haptic feedback system and vibration types were
introduced in our recent study [69].

Experiments

Subjects and subject preparation

Eight healthy subjects (4 male, 4 female; avg. age: 25.375
years, range: 20—39 years; avg. BMI: 22.912 kg/m?, range:
19.1-27.4kg/m7) participated after giving informed

Page 6 of 13

consent in accordance with the California State Uni-
versity Long Beach Institutional Review Board. Eight
subjects were sufficient for identifying a knee flexion
moment reduction based on a priori sample size calcula-
tions. To have scientifically correct subject-specific scal-
ing for the modeling purposes in our future work, we did
not include children or the elderly. Inclusion criteria for
subject recruitment are the following: (1) between ages of
18 and 40 years old; (2) familiar with running on a tread-
mill; and (3) run at least 8 miles/week for 4 weeks prior
to participation. Exclusion criteria for subject recruit-
ment are the following: (1) history of lower extremity
or low back surgery that may affect running kinematics,
kinetics or muscle activation; (2) lower extremity or low
back pathology that causes pain or discomfort during the
experiment or within 3 months prior to participation;
and (3) any physical or mental condition that may pre-
vent the subject from running safely.

Each subject was prepared with a lycra-based athletic
compression suit. The suit included vibrotactile motors
that provided haptic feedback on six locations. The loca-
tions of the vibrotactile motors included the upper back,
lower back, lateral knee joint (both knees), and lateral
ankle joint (both ankles). In addition to the compres-
sion suit, the subject also wore a Perception Neuron Pro
IMU full-body suit over the compression suit. 17 sensors
placed on each subject were used to track the whole-
body motion. The location of the sensors are included in
the following list: head, upper back, shoulders (left and
right), upper arms (left and right), forearms (left and
right), hands (left and right), lower Back (waist), upper
legs (left and right), lower legs (left and right), feet (left
and right). Experimental set up took approximately 15
min. Figure 2 shows the subject wearing the sensing and
feedback system.

Motion training

The objective of the experiment was to adjust the sub-
ject’s posture while running with haptic feedback. We
targeted three gait parameters that previous studies had
identified as having an influence on reducing the knee
flexion moment: trunk lean [8], cadence [86, 87], and
foot strike [88, 89]. Each of these kinematic variable has
been shown to associate with increased risk of running
injuries. As specified in [15], data was collected/sampled
every 25 steps, as this was a sufficient number of steps to
modify a single motion parameter.

The experiment consisted of three major parts. The
first major part of the experiment collected the subject’s
baseline information from a 90-s running session. The
subject then took a 2 min break before moving on to the
second major part of the experiment to avoid fatigue. The
second major part of the experiment was the first haptic

feedback session that consisted of three 120-s runs with
2 min breaks in between each run. The subject expe-
rienced 1 of 3 types of haptic feedback during each run
of the first feedback session. These vibrations guided the
subject to adjust specific kinematic variables during the
run. The three types of haptic feedback included the fol-
lowing: torso feedback (increase/decrease trunk lean),
knee feedback (increase/decrease cadence), and ankle
feedback (increase/decrease foot drop angle). The sec-
ond major part of the experiment was the second haptic
feedback session that consisted of four 120-s runs with
2 min breaks in between. The subject experienced com-
binations of 2 types haptic feedback as follows: torso
and knees (increase/decrease trunk lean and increase/
decrease cadence), torso and ankles (increase/decrease
trunk lean and increase/decrease foot drop angle),
and knees and ankles (increase/decrease cadence and
increase/decrease foot drop angle) during each run of the
second feedback session. Vibrations were sent in either
continuous or staggered mode [69] to indicate the subject

Page 7 of 13

must increase or decrease the kinematic variable of inter-
est. The subject was asked to try to maintain a posture
and pace that resulted in no haptic feedback for a total of
15 s. The subject ran a maximum of 15.5 min throughout
the experiment. However, this time can be less depending
on the subject’s success of meeting the posture and pace
goal. Immediately after the experiment, subjects were
also asked to report the comfort level during locomotion
using bipolar Likert-type ten-point scales.

Data analysis

The motion data was acquired using Perception Neu-
ron Pro suit at 120 Hz sampling rate. The musculoskel-
etal model was scaled to each subject’s total mass and
height. The ground reaction forces and the angles in the
lower limb joints were determined throughout the entire
stance phase using our simulation framework. Kinematic
parameters including trunk lean angle, cadence, foot drop
angle, and running speed were determined for the base-
line and haptic training. The net internal ankle, knee, and
hip joint moments in the sagittal and frontal planes were
calculated using a Newton-Euler inverse dynamics tech-
nique implemented in our simulation framework. All net
joint moments were normalized to subject’s baseline. In
addition, the average peak values of KFM during stance
phase of running were determined. The whole-body
effort was calculated using the algorithm presented in the
previous sections. Figure 3 shows the motion reconstruc-
tion using a scaled human biomechanical model in our
framework. An example of subject’s baseline data is also
shown in Fig. 3.

Statistical analysis

To evaluate statistical differences in the results of the
experiment, analyses of variance ANOVAs were per-
formed. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed
to compare the results within subjects. When significant
main effects were identified, paired t-tests were used to
compare cases. Correlation coefficients were calculated
to determine if the percent reduction in KFM was cor-
related with the effort or the baseline KFM. Alpha was set
at 0.05 for all statistical analyses.

Results and discussion

Results

All 8 subjects responded to the haptic feedback devices
by running with the new patterns, and reduced their
KFM with haptic feedback compared with baseline. The
new running patterns resulted in increases in trunk lean
angle, foot drop angle, and cadence, and they resulted
in a decrease in KFM. The final KFM was significantly

KFM is the average value of the peak knee flexion moments during the training. Moments are scaled by subject's baseline. The final KFM was significantly lower than

baseline in all cases p < 0.01. The effort remained comparable to subject’s baseline

feedback post-training percent KFM values and the effort
(r = 0.72). No statistical difference was found between
single- and multi-parameter feedback. Post-training run-
ning patterns evidenced increases in kinematic variables
(trunk lean, foot drop, and cadence) as shown in Table 4
(p < 0.05 for all variables).

Discussion

This pilot study showed that providing real-time feed-
back based on biomechanical modeling and haptics was
an efficient locomotion training method for reducing the
KFM. This real-time feedback approach for a repetitive
task has the potential to greatly improve the effective-
ness of subject-specific motion training and reduce the
risk of injuries. Our study conforms to previous studies
that identified the kinematic variables as having an influ-
ence on reducing the knee flexion moment: trunk lean
[8], cadence [86, 87], and foot strike [88, 89]. Increasing
trunk lean, cadence and foot drop angle decreased the

KFM during stance, which aligns with the previous work.
In addition, the results of our pilot study showed the
combined effect of the kinematic variables on KFM via
a fully-portable feedback system. Although the direction
of change for each running kinematic variable was gen-
erally consistent across subjects, the amount of change
varied considerably. This was due to subject-specific dif-
ferences in degree of influence of running parameters on
the KFM.

The best feedback type for each subject is shown in
Tables 2 and 3. Baseline and trained running kinemat-
ics were shown in Table 4. In single-parameter train-
ing, the foot drop angle (i.e., forefoot strike) had a
significant impact on the KFM (average KFM reduction:
46.33%, p < 0.01). Additionally, increased trunk lean and
cadence caused reductions in the average peak of the
KFM. The average reduction in KFM was 35.43%, 46.33%,
and 14.78% with single-parameter trunk lean, foot drop,
and cadence feedback, respectively. In multi-parameter

The optimal KFM state kinematics highlight the subject-specific nature of the motion training

training, the combination of trunk lean and foot drop
angles had a significant impact on KFM (average KFM
reduction: 36.09%, p < 0.01). The second most effective
multi-parameter training was the combination of trunk
lean angle and cadence, which decreased the average
KFM by 24.58%. The combination of foot drop angle and
cadence didn’t have significant effect on the KFM. Over-
all, the computed effort remained comparable to subject’s
baseline. This finding evidenced that the new running
patterns did not significantly increase muscle efforts, and
thus remained comfortable to the subject.

In summary, this study showed that biomechanical
modeling with haptic feedback is an effective method
for improving posture for efficient running patterns.
Significant KFM reductions were evidenced in every
individual due to the subject-specific variations and
without altering subject’s effort. Novel running patterns
were identified and adopted in multiple training ses-
sions using a model-based, portable sensing and feedback
system. In the future, we plan to extend our framework
and experiments to include multimodal cues and assess
the retention of the adopted motion patterns. Plans for
multi-modal feedback include to provide both concur-
rent and terminal feedback for running. A retention test
will be implemented while subjects walk without any
feedback. Terminal feedback has been found to promote
motor learning and facilitates motor retention [90]. In
addition to visual feedback, participants of the study will
receive tactile feedback. To verify and validate the types
of feedback, a between-participant design will investigate
participants’ abilities to detect the feedback. In the tactile
condition, participants will receive a vibratory stimulus
and self-select a running speed for a duration of 15 min.
The timing and location of the feedback while running
will be determined by a ’priority’ schedule used by [85].

Participants will be asked to respond to the feedback
by indicating to experimenters they felt the vibration or
repeat the body part that was provided by the auditory
feedback.

Conclusions

Since the 1970s, running popularity has continuously
grown as a professional and recreational sport. It is esti-
mated 65 million people participated in this activity in
United States alone in 2017 [91]. Between 1990 and 2013,
road race finishers grew from five millions to over 19
million [92]. Contributing to its popularity, running was
proved to have major health benefits, such as improving
cardiovascular endurance and overall quality of life, and
decreasing the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and
hypertension [93]. In the U.S., 10—20% of the population
run regularly, with 40-50% of those injured annually [3].
Among these injuries, half occur at the knee joint, with
patellofemoral pain (PFP) being the most common diag-
nosis [2, 4]. PFP can lead to severe pain and disability and
is a precursor of knee osteoarthritis [5]. There lies a huge
potential for sports science and physical therapy to use
feedback mechanisms as intervention tool [14]. One of
the advantages of motion feedback is the enhancement of
a user’s ability to function in a cognitively overloaded sit-
uation, such as a multi-task scenario (e.g., running while
adapting to postural changes for one or more segments).
Our framework is unique in that it integrates portable
sensors, models motion dynamics in real-time, and pro-
vides concurrent feedback to improve running.

A limitation in this study was that motion training was
performed on healthy subjects without prior injury. To
have scientifically correct subject-specific modeling and
scaling for our biomechanical model in this study, we did
not include patients or the elderly, although this can be

extended in future work. History of lower extremity or
low back surgery may affect running kinematics, kinet-
ics or muscle activation. Similarly, lower extremity or low
back pathology may cause pain or discomfort during run-
ning. Older patients may also have difficultly remember-
ing gait modifications trained with real-time feedback,
particularly if the new gait patterns were a complicated
combination of movement alterations. Other future
work includes the integration of a multi-modal feedback
mechanism in the framework, as subject’s perception of
feedback modalities may vary based on the age, gender,
fitness level, and injury history.

This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of provid-
ing real-time haptic feedback for motion training using a
fully portable, model-based framework. While the pro-
posed framework and pilot study address improving run-
ning kinematics and associated health outcomes, future
studies should be associated with utilizing the framework
with modified models for use with activities of daily liv-
ing (ADL) and sport activities. Improved performance of
ADL will assist with elderly populations in fall reduction
and disabled communities with impaired sensory sys-
tems. With the rapid increase in repetitive sport injuries,
use of our framework with sport specific modeling pro-
cedures and learning protocols may provide mechanisms
to analyze and improve kinematics and kinetics for the
purposes of injury reduction and improved performance.
