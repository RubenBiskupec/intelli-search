Sterns Medioal Un anita of affective dynamics by analyzing a large-scale dataset of Facebook status updates

Vienna, Vienna, Austria using text analysis techniques. Our analyses support the central assumptions of our
model: After stimulation, affective states, quantified as valence and arousal,
exponentially return to an individual-specific baseline. On average, this baseline is at a
slightly positive valence value and at a moderate arousal point below the midpoint.
Furthermore, affective expression, in this case posting a status update on Facebook,
immediately pushes arousal and valence towards the baseline by a proportional
value. These results are robust to the choice of the text analysis technique and
illustrate the fast timescale of affective dynamics through social media text. These
outcomes are of high relevance for affective computing, the detection and modeling
of collective emotions, the refinement of psychological research methodology, and
the detection of abnormal, and potentially pathological, individual affect dynamics.

“When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, an hundred.”
Thomas Jefferson

1 Introduction
Emotions have profound influence on human cognition and behavior across many do-
mains [1]: They bias memory, perception, and decision making [2] and provide feedback
for past and guidance for current behavior [3]. Some of the most prevalent mental disor-
ders, such as depression and anxiety disorder, are characterized by abnormal emotional
states [4-6]. Moreover, emotions have a social function. Experiencing emotions induces
a tendency to share them with others, causing them to experience these emotions too [7],
thus giving rise to collective emotions with often profound impact on society at large [8, 9].
While the influence of emotions on cognition and behavior is well established, most
studies leave aside one crucial aspect: the temporal dynamics of emotional states. It is
commonly assumed that emotions relax over time if they are not re-stimulated [10-12].
But at which rate do emotional states relax? Knowing this would tell us for how long after

an emotion-inducing event the cognitive and behavioral impact of emotions can be ex-
pected to last. For example, is it enough to follow Jefferson’s advice and count to ten or
a hundred, in order to avoid the negative effects of anger? A second question concerns
the baseline to which emotions return after an emotion-inducing event: Do we return to
a state of completely neutral emotions or are there individual baselines shifted away from
the middle point? Furthermore, expressing emotions can have an effect on affective dy-
namics: If we ignore Jefferson's advice and speak our minds while we are still angry, will
this expressive act relax our emotional state—and if so, by how much?

In this study, we want to tackle these questions by (i) formulating a mathematical model
of affective dynamics, and (ii) testing this model by analyzing the digital traces of sponta-
neous affective expression, in the form of a large-scale dataset of Facebook status updates.

This approach of testing psychological hypotheses with online data is still new, but has
already proven its worth [13]. For example, it has been shown that the experience of ex-
cited emotional states leads to information sharing in social media [14], and in turn, that
online emotional expression can drive emotional contagion [15], can regulate emotions
through labelling [16], and can affect happiness through social comparison [17] and pop-
ularity through social regulation of emotions [18]. Other studies have shown how mood
oscillates over seasons [19] and how air pollution is linked to expressed well-being [20].
Based on online data, it also possible to detect strong collective emotions, as they appeared
in France following the terrorist attacks of Paris in November 2015, and to show how they
can contribute to the rise of solidarity and to social resilience [21].

Analyzing online data helps us to avoid some of the limitations of more traditional meth-
ods to quantify emotional states. While self-reports of momentary emotional states can
show their dynamics when gathered through hand-held devices [10], this method requires
participants to assess their emotions several times a day, interrupting their daily routine
and affecting their attention. The high demand on study participants limits sample sizes
and the applicability of this method. Other research has used controlled experiments to
elicit emotional reactions and track their evolution over time [12]. While this has the ad-
vantage of highlighting the dynamics of emotions in contrast to external sources of noise,
it suffers a series of limitations to external validity. Artificial exposure to stimuli in exper-
iments can greatly differ from the properties of natural exposure in real-world situations
[22]. Laboratory research can also suffer other limitations, such as experimenter effects
that distort the dynamics of emotions [23].

The large amounts of data produced by social media users offer a way to complement
previous research on emotion dynamics. But using social media data in affective science
also has limitations. The output of common sentiment analysis methods on social me-
dia posts over long periods of time has low correlation with the result of questionnaires
on persistent mood states [24]. At faster timescales, however, sentiment analysis of so-
cial media text correlates with individual self-reports of momentary affective states [12].
Thus, the analysis of online data can, despite its limitations, complement more traditional
psychological methods in important ways.

Quantifying emotion dynamics has potential further research applications that motivate
our work. Through a social-interactionist approach [25], a better understanding of indi-
vidual affective dynamics can also help us to explain the emergence of collective emotions.
Collective emotions are hypothesized to sustain themselves for longer periods than purely
individual emotional reactions [9]. Thus, having a better estimate of the average time scale
Pellert et al. EPJ Data Science (2020) 9:1 Page 3 of 14

of individual emotions can help us to identify collective emotions empirically. And finally,
knowledge about typical affective dynamics in the general population can also help us to
detect abnormal dynamics, which have been linked to mental disorders like depression
[6, 26].

2 Modeling affective dynamics

The individual dynamics of affect capture the changes in emotional states over time inde-
pendent of social interaction or other external stimuli. In 2010, two research teams inde-
pendently formulated models of individual dynamics of affect: The Cyberemotions frame-
work [11] and the DynAffect model [10]. Both groups focused on the core affect dimen-
sions of valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) and arousal (excited vs. calm) [27]. Also, both
groups assumed that affect (both valence and arousal) relax exponentially towards a base-
line. The Cyberemotions framework aims at modeling the emergence of collective emo-
tions in online communities, leaving details about online interaction to be defined by each
model in the framework [11]. To this end, this framework also includes the antecedents
and effects of emotional expression into affective dynamics. In particular, the Cyberemo-
tions framework assumes that expressing emotions would have a regulating feedback ef-
fect on the emotional state—a claim backed by psychological research [28].

Some assumptions of the Cyberemotions framework have been tested empirically in
experiments involving reading as well as writing emotional online posts [12]. Affect was
quantified using self-ratings and sentiment detection on the participants’ messages. The
DynAffect model was tested in two experiments using repeated experience sampling of
a student cohort in everyday life circumstances [10]. While evidence largely validates the
dynamics of Dynaffect, studies produced puzzling outcomes with regard to the strength
of exponential relaxation of affect: The estimates for the affective relaxation parameters
were much larger in the first than in the second experiment. This was unexpected, because
the only major difference between the two experiments was that the rate of experience
sampling, i.e. how often participants had to rate their current valence and arousal, was
more frequent in the first experiment. However, if we see these ratings as a form of affective
expression, the regulation feedback effect postulated by the Cyberemotions model can
explain why more frequent expressions lead to seemingly faster affective relaxation.

Thus, for our current study, we combine the assumption of exponential relaxation from
both models with DynAffect’s postulate of individual affective baselines [10] and the reg-
ulation effect of affective expression from the Cyberemotions model [11, 12].

We formalize these assumptions following the formalism of the Cyberemotions frame-
work [11, 12]. We quantify the emotional state of an individual at time ¢ through its valence
v(t) and arousal a(t). The dynamics of valence and arousal only differ in their parameter
values, not in their mathematical form, and thus we denote x(t) as either valence or arousal
in the general equations.

Our individual emotions model consists of two parts. First, the effect of expression, by
which the action of posting a status update induces an instant emotion down-regulation
by a constant factor k:

xj (tafter) = (xi(thefore) ~ Li) & K + Lie (1)

In the above equation, individual i started to write a status update at time thefore, eXpressing
an emotional state x;(tpefore), quantified as valence or arousal. The emotional state of the
Pellert et al. EPJ Data Science (2020) 9:1 Page 4 of 14

individual when posting the status update is %;(tafter). For simplicity, we assume that the
timescale of writing is faster than the timescale between posting status updates, and thus
we model the effect of writing in x; as an instantaneous change. The baseline of x for the
individual is z;, denoting the ground state in which the emotions of the individual would
tend to be stable over time in the absence of stimuli. This individual baseline can be mea-
sured through the average of several emotional states (valence and arousal) measured for
the same individual over long periods of time. We use this approach as we later explain in
Sect. 3.3. After the expression of the emotion, the state of the individual instantly changes
to a value adjusted by the distance to the baseline multiplied by a constant factor k. This
equation models a stable regulation towards the baseline when 0 < k < 1, which has been
previously observed in experiments [12]. In our empirical analyses, we test the hypothe-
ses that k is larger than zero and lower than 1, i.e. that there is an effect of expression that
attenuates emotions towards a fixed individual baseline.

The second component of emotion dynamics in our model is the internal relaxation
of emotional states. Following the modeling framework [11] and empirical observations
[10], we model the internal relaxation of emotions as a mean-reverting process towards

the baseline:

dx;(t)
dt

 

= ~y (xi(t) — wi) +E). (2)

In the above equation, the change in emotional state per time unit is proportional to the
difference of that emotional state to the individual baseline ;. The noise term &(t) cap-
tures external forces that change emotions and that we are not modelling in this case. The
coefficient y quantifies that proportional relaxation towards the baseline. When 0 < y < 1,
the value of x;(t) approaches the baseline ju; over time. This kind of exponential relaxation
has been observed in previous empirical research [10, 12], serving as the starting point of
our individual dynamics model. In this case, when the value of x;(t) is below the baseline,
the value of x;(t) increases over time, approaching the baseline from below. Our empiri-
cal analysis aims to test the hypotheses that y is below 1 and above zero, estimating the
best-fitting value of y.

Equation (2) is an example of an Ornstein—Uhlenbeck process [29]. We can formulate
the expected value of x; after a fixed At time:

Elxi(t + At)] =e”! (x;(t) — pi) + Mi (3)

We combine this solution with the effect of expression of Equation (1) to formulate the

statistical model explained in Sect. 3.3.

3 Data and methods

3.1 Text analysis of affective expression

We study emotions as core affect [30], i.e. short-lived psychological states of high rele-
vance to the individual that do not need to have a particular target. States in core affect
are measured in terms of valence and arousal. Valence quantifies the degree of pleasure as-
sociated with an emotion and arousal the activation induced by that emotion. For example,
the word “joy” manifests a positive valence, high arousal state, while the word “sadness”
is used to express a negative valence, low arousal state. Further words can be annotated
Pellert et al. EPJ Data Science (2020) 9:1 Page 5 of 14

in this valence and arousal space, a method popularized by the ANEW lexicon [31] that
builds on the semantic differential method [32]. Note that this approach assumes that
affect can be measured from its expression through human communication. While a sub-
stantial level of noise can be expected when using these text analysis methods to quantify
emotions, the use of large-scale data from social media and other digital resources allows
the analysis of individual and collective emotions through temporal and structural pat-
terns [16, 19, 21, 33, 34].

We quantify valence and arousal expressed in each status update through unsupervised
methods that compute mean scores over stemmed terms in a text [35]. To verify that our
results are not an artifact of a particular lexicon, we employ two lexica generated with dif-
ferent annotation schemes: the Affective Norms (WKB: Warriner—Kuperman-—Brysbaert)
lexicon [36], which includes 13,915 lemmas covering the most frequent terms from a sub-
titles corpus, and the NRC (National Research Council Canada) Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance (NRC-VAD) lexicon [37], which includes more than 20,000 terms selected
from various sources. We refer to these text analysis methods to quantify valence and
arousal as the WKB method and the NRC-VAD method respectively. In the main text we
present results using the WKB method and report results using the NRC-VAD method as
an alternative in the Supplementary materials.

While other methods besides WKB and NRC-VAD have been developed to measure
sentiment or affect from social media text, the lexica of these two methods are the most
comprehensive, cover the widest ranges of emotional terms, and their fundamental princi-
ple has been validated in benchmark studies [38, 39]. The flexibility of these unsupervised
methods to quantify affective expression allows the generalization of our analyses beyond
Facebook. This would not be possible if we apply supervised methods trained only for
Facebook as a particular domain [40]. Other unsupervised methods have achieved high
levels of accuracy for sentiment annotation tasks in terms of sentiment classes (positive,
negative, neutral) [38]. Among the best is VADER [41], a tool that returns a numeric score
of sentiment that has been trained and validated against categorical data. While this tool
has been shown useful to characterize ensemble average valence in Twitter [16], we cannot
use it to track individual-level valence values due to the trimodal distribution of VADER
scores (see Fig. 9 in Supplementary materials).

3.2 Facebook status updates dataset
We analyze a dataset of Facebook status updates generated by the MyPersonality project
[42]. This dataset contains more than 22 Million status updates that were voluntarily pro-
vided for academic research by 153,727 Facebook users between 2009 and 2011. Through
the MyPersonality consortium, we accessed an anonymized timestamped dataset of sta-
tus updates without any personally identifiable information. This dataset and subsets of it
have been used in previous research on computational personality recognition [43], pref-
erence in music [44] and sentiment of religious affiliation [45]. We filter observations from
the raw dataset according to the following guideline: First, we discard pairs of subsequent
status updates that cannot get assigned at least one term from our sentiment lexicon each.
Additionally, we remove low activity users that updated their status less than 20 times over
the whole observation period. After data-preprocessing, we are left with 16.9 Million sta-
tus updates by 114,967 users.

Users included in this dataset self-selected by deciding to use the MyPersonality Face-
book application. This might imply that their demographics and personalities differ from

the general population [46], in line with general limitations for the use of social media
data in the social sciences [47]. However, it is worth noting that this user sample is more
diverse than the typical participant sample of psychological research, often composed of
students of high socio-economic status [48]. The Facebook status updates of the dataset
resemble diary-like records in which individuals write about moments in their life. This
can be observed on the word cloud of the left panel of Fig. 1, which displays words typi-
cal found in a diary (day, good, have, be, love, want, time). The dataset does not include
replies or comments into wider conversations. It only contains status updates that users
wrote by their own initiative. Users chose to share their full time lines of status updates
for research. While these status updates are still performative acts in front of the social
environment of the user, they compose spontaneous communication in a medium used to
talk about one’s life. In contrast to other media like Reddit, Facebook status updates lack
a particular fixed topic or context beyond what the individual user chooses to talk about.
With an average of 143 status updates per user, this dataset composes a longitudinal and
comprehensive record of social media text.

All data was voluntarily donated by the users of MyPersonality. Therefore, bot and spam
accounts in this study are not an issue as in other social media like Twitter. Nevertheless,
Twitter has the benefit of a widespread access for researchers and of very high data vol-
umes, which enabled previous analyses of emotion dynamics [16]. The down side of this
ease of access is the Twitter model organism problem [49], which calls for studies in other

social media in order to generalize to human behavior [50].

3.3 Statistical model

We now derive a statistical model based on the principles expounded in the Modeling af-
fective dynamics section above and that can be fitted with the output of text analysis of the
Facebook status updates dataset. As a previous step to statistical analysis, we calculate the

individual baselines of valence and arousal as the mean over the analyzed status updates

Page 6 of 14
Pellert et al. EPJ Data Science (2020) 9:1 Page 7 of 14

of each individual. Then we subtract this baseline from the sequence of emotional expres-
sions of a user. Thereby, we simplify the model such that relaxation happens towards zero,
removing persistent inter-individual differences of affective baselines. For each sequential
pair of status updates of user i between time ¢ and ¢ + At, we fit the following equations

of the value of valence V;;,4; and arousal A;;,,; expressed in the second status update:

Vitsat = ew (k, *k Vit) + €y;
(4)

—y,zAt
Ajtsat =e" (ka * Aj 1) + Eq;

where k, and k, quantify the regulation effect of online expression, y, and y, quantify the
relaxation speed, and €, and €, are regression residuals assumed to be normally distributed
and uncorrelated. We fit the above model with the m/s function of the stats package for the
R statistical language [51]. We fit the model with weights for each sample proportional to
the logarithm of At + 1 in order to focus on the fast timescale of valence and arousal. An
alternative to this decision is to use an empirical method to find a time cutoff [16]. How-
ever, to include all data in our analysis, we choose a weighted regression scheme instead
of finding a cutoff timescale. We compute 95% confidence intervals and p-values with the
coeftest function of the /mtest package for R and run a series of regression diagnostics to
validate the assumptions of our statistical model.

Note that contrary to previous research [16], we fit the emotional expression at the in-
dividual status update level rather than the binned mean value versus time. This has the
advantage that our estimates can be used to calibrate models of individual emotions and

give precise estimates of the parameters of emotion dynamics.

4 Results

The 2d-histogram of individual baselines of valence and arousal is shown on the in the left
panel of Fig. 1. The baselines of arousal are generally located below its midpoint, with a
mean value of 4.13. With very few exceptions, the baselines of valence are concentrated
around a value above the midpoint, with a mean of 5.88. These two values are very close
to empirical observations in self-reports [10]. Positive valence baselines are also consis-
tent with the Pollyanna principle [52], which has been observed previously in other kinds
of online expression [53, 54] and general text [36, 55]. Further descriptive figures can be
found in the Supplementary materials, including examples of individual trajectories of ex-

pressed valence and arousal.

4.1 Affective memory

Expressed emotions relax towards the baseline, but this does not happen instantly. Figure 2
shows the mean changes in expressed valence and arousal as a function of the valence and
arousal of the previous status updates at three timescales. The first status update belongs
to one bin of the 9 x 9 affective grid and the mean value of its subsequent status update
is directed towards the baseline. Status updates written within short timespans (with a
maximum At of 5 minutes) do not completely reach the baseline value. At longer time
scales (At up to 2 years) the expected value of valence and arousal of the second status
update is clearly at the baseline, as shown on the right panel of Fig. 2. These patterns

illustrate the existence of both an attractive force and an affective memory in which the

emotions expressed in two consecutive states are related as long as the time in between is
short.

In the following, we present the general patterns of emotion dynamics up to 300 seconds,
but our statistical analysis includes all time intervals between subsequent posts of the same
user. We present figures with patterns up to 300 minutes in the Supplementary materials.

We quantitatively assess the existence of affective memory through the autocorrelation
function of valence and arousal in consecutive status updates of the same individual. Fig-
ure 3 shows Pearson’s correlation coefficient as a function of time between status updates
for arousal and valence, with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals computed over 10,000
samples. For short timescales the correlation coefficients are significant, reaching values
above 0.4. The value decreases for longer time intervals, reaching for the first time non-
significant values after 141 seconds for valence and after 129 seconds for arousal. This
shows that there is a robust affective memory at short time scales. However, when we con-
sider status updates separated by few minutes, the correlation between expressed valence
and arousal is indistinguishable from zero. These results are the same using an alternative

text analysis method, as shown on Fig. 1 of the Supplementary materials.

4.2 Affect dynamics model fits

When starting from a given value of valence and arousal, the expected value of the emo-
tions expressed in the next status updates is shown on Fig. 4 as a function of time between
status updates. The process is mean-reverting: When starting from a negative value (note
that we have subtracted individual baselines), the expected value approaches zero from be-
low. When starting from a positive value, this approach happens from above. The expected
value becomes indistinguishable from zero at longer timescales, as shown in Figure 3 of
the Supplementary materials.

We validate the above observations by fitting the statistical model introduced in
Sect. 3.3. The coefficient estimates of the fits for valence and arousal are shown in Table 1.
The relaxation coefficient for arousal (y, = 0.0105 s~!, CI = [0.0101,0.0108]) is stronger
than for valence (y, = 0.0070 s~!, CI = [0.0068, 0.0072]). This observation is consistent
with previous results of experiments [12] and in-vivo self-reports [10]. Users that write
status updates with high arousal content are less likely to have comparable high arousal in
the next status update if more than a few minutes pass in between them. Note that these
rescaled measures have to be interpreted as deviations from the affective baseline of each
user. The feedback effect of expression is captured by the estimates of k, and k,, taking
values of 0.38 and 0.45 respectively. This indicates that a large fraction of the initial emo-
tional state is regulated by expression, with roughly 40% of valence and arousal remaining.
Our initial hypotheses of y and k between zero and one for both valence and arousal are
supported by these results, indicating the presence of stable emotional relaxation towards
the individual baselines and a regulation effect of affective expression.

An illustration of the fast relaxation towards the baseline that is captured by the model
can be observed in Fig. 5. Starting values of high valence or arousal instantly regulate by
a proportional factor and then exponentially approach zero from above. The converse is
also observable for arousal and valence values below zero, which first regulate towards
zero and then approach it exponentially from below (also observable on Fig. 4).

Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent estimates for the models yield coef-
ficient estimates very close to the ones reported in Table 1 and remain significant. These

results are very similar when using the alternative sentiment analysis method, as reported

on the Supplementary Table 1. This indicates that our main results are not an artifact of
some particular errors or biases of the text analysis tool.

Both models outperform other approaches to modelling emotion dynamics. The resid-
ual sum of squares of our fits of valence and arousal are lower than the ones for mod-
els without relaxation (y = 0), without expression effect (k = 0) and than models of a
linear relaxation over time and of a cubic polynomial of time. In both our fits, regres-
sion residuals are approximately normal (Shapiro—Wilk statistic of residuals for valence
and arousal models are above 0.95), uncorrelated with fitted values (valence p = —0.0017,
arousal p = —0.0014) and with independent variables (o at most 0.016 for valence and at
most 0.013 for arousal). Residuals show no correlation across subsequent status updates
of the same individuals (o = 0.015 for valence, and p = 0.013 for arousal). This evidences
the validity of the formulation of emotion dynamics as a combination of an expression
effect and a proportional relaxation towards an individual baseline, as presented in the
Section 2.

The memory patterns of our model, while consistent with previous research, could also
be explained by collective and cultural synchronization processes that influence emotional
expression. For example, seasonal greetings such as “happy New Year” or “merry Christ-
mas” could introduce artifacts in our measurement as manifestations of collective mood
[34]. We account for these effects in our analyses, we repeated the model fits including
additional inter-individual weekly baselines for valence and arousal. Results are very sim-
ilar with this seasonal corrections, as presented more in detail in the section “seasonal

correction” in the Supplementary materials.

5 Conclusions

Our analysis of the temporal dynamics of affective expression on Facebook validates our
model of affective dynamics. We confirmed the existence of individual affective baselines,
which are concentrated around a slightly positive valence and moderate arousal point.
Furthermore, using a nonlinear regression model, we validated the assumption that va-
lence and arousal exponentially relax towards the individual baseline. This can be seen
as a short-term memory of emotional expression: Valence and arousal of two consecutive
status updates of the same individual are highly correlated up to few minutes, but become
uncorrelated for longer time spans. We find considerable regulation effect exists for both
valence and arousal—meaning affective expressions instantly reduce the magnitude of af-
fective states by a proportional factor.

Our results are consistent with previous observational analyses of emotion labelling in
Twitter [16]. When compared to our work, the analysis of [16] focused on the relaxation
of emotions after an explicit labelling report, a phenomenon that operates at a longer
timescale than our analysis of spontaneous relaxation of valence and arousal. This illus-
trates that various aspects and timescales of affective life can be analyzed through social
media data, capturing both the relaxation trends of core affect and of mood and other
more persistent phenomena.

While our analysis has revealed fundamental properties of emotion dynamics, it is im-
portant to highlight its limitations. Our model is not a predictive tool that can provide
accurate estimates of sentiment in the future, especially when looking at long timescales.
However, the large-scale dataset we analyzed allowed us to make robust inferences that
point to emotion dynamics in general. Future studies can include additional external data
(e.g. social interaction, time of the day, demographic attributes) to generate predictive
tools beyond our work. In addition, social media activity has a performative nature and
data is generated with self-selection biases that can affect the results of text analysis.
Nonetheless, our analyses allow us to overcome some limitations of traditional methods,
tracking emotions over long timespans in a large sample of users more diverse that the
typical sample of a psychology study. Furthermore, our results agree with previous results
and are consistent across the two sentiment analysis methods we applied. All methods in
psychology have limitations, only by comparing their results in various scenarios we can
converge to a unified understanding of human behavior.

The evidence gathered by our analysis contributes to an emerging research line of com-
putational modelling of emotions [9, 11]. Computational models, in particular agent-
based models, formalize the dynamics of individual properties and the interaction and
communication between individuals to explain collective and complex behavior. For these
models to go beyond theoretical arguments, it is necessary to empirically test their as-
sumptions and to calibrate their parameter values with empirical data. Our work has val-
idated a series of assumptions of these models [12] and we have calculated precise values
for the parameters of individual emotion dynamics as manifested through social media.

Such quantitative models of affective dynamics can also contribute to the understand-
ing and treatment of affective disorders. While complex psychological dynamics measured
with questionnaires bring limited information to assess well-being [56], a data-richer sce-
nario (like social media research) might provide enough accuracy to reveal the role of com-
plex affective dynamics. Other than to psychopathology, empirically calibrated emotion

dynamics models can also be applied to simulate emotional reactions in affective comput-

ing technologies [57]. For example, facial expressions of virtual humans can be simulated
with our model [58], and dialog systems can provide plausible emotion dynamics with the
appropriate parameters [59].

Furthermore, our findings have some implications for the methodology of affective psy-
chology. In particular, our model can help researchers to (i) estimate the actual affective
impact of a given stimulus, based on its dynamic relaxation, (ii) determine the necessary
length of measurement intervals and breaks between stimuli, in order to avoid carry-over
effects of emotions, and (iii) beware of and control for the regulation feedback effect of
affective expression, which might also occur after self-ratings.

The parameters of our models are very similar to the ones found in experiments of on-
line interaction [12]. Despite using a very different design (observation vs experiment),
methodology (text analysis vs self-rating) and sample composition (student sample vs
Facebook users), we obtain very similar estimates for the affective baselines and relaxation
parameters. This constitutes a strong validation of our model of affective dynamics—much
more so than a simple replication of previous studies. Beyond that, our methods have ad-
ditional advantages when compared to traditional methods: They include larger and more
representative participant samples, behavior can be measured for longer time periods, and
the cost of data gathering and reuse is substantially lower. This shows how psychological
research can be advanced through data science, especially through the analysis of large-
scale data sets of online behavioral traces.
