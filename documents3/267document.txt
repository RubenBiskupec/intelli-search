Abstract

In many countries, the parallel lines are widely used in transmission systems due to economic and technical benefits.
Distance relays have poor performance on the protection of parallel transmission lines because of the mutual
coupling effect. The distance relay may underreach when both lines are in-service. On the other hand the over
reach problem may arise when only one line is in-service and another line is disconnected and grounded at both
sides. Therefore, a new intelligent method is presented to protect parallel lines comprehensively in different operat-
ing modes. In the first stage, considering the status of circuit breakers as well as measured current signals at both
sides of parallel lines, the fault types are identified by allocating a probabilistic neural network (PNN). Then, in the
second stage, the fault location is estimated by assigning an artificial neural network (ANN) to each type of fault.
The results obtained from the simulation of a part of the power system including 230-kV parallel lines, show that
the proposed method can accurately detect all fault types and also it can precisely locate the fault points with an
accuracy of 98.8%.

Introduction

Installation and operation of parallel transmission lines are
increasingly developing due to several advantages from dif-
ferent aspects such as power transfer capability, availability,
environmental and economic factors.

Distance relays are the conventional protection of transmis-
sion lines but when used for the parallel lines protection, their
performance is affected by mutual coupling effect. The dis-
tance relay may overreach when one of the lines is switched
off and grounded at both sides. Moreover, the undereach prob-
lem may arise when both lines are operating in parallel [1].
Several methods have been presented for the protection of
parallel transmission lines. One of the conventional protection
schemes is a cross differential technique [2, 3]. When one of
the lines is ou-of-service and earthed on both ends, a cross
differential protection scheme will not be useful because its
performance is based on the comparison between currents of
the same phases in the parallel circuits. Moreover, cross dif-
ferential based techniques are not able to determine the fault
locations. In some methods, traveling waves have been used
for fast fault detection and location [4—8]. The main disadvan-
tage of the travelling waves-based methods is that the protec-
tion scheme yields poor performance for faults close in faults.

Moreover, some intelligent methods have been presented
for transmission line protection using artificial neural net-
works (ANNs) [9]. To improve the distance protection scheme
for parallel lines protection, an ANN based method has been
presented in [10] that could only detect single-phase to ground
faults. In [11], an intelligent protective algorithm based on the
phase comparator has been presented to detect directional
earth fault without using the voltage signal. In [12], an ANN
is used to estimate the entire power system conditions based

on local measurements. The main drawback of these intelli-
gent methods is that the fault type identification are not
implemented.

In some other methods, the well-known signal processing
tool i.e. wavelet transform (WT) is used to analyze measured
signals to improve fault locator performance [13 and 14].

In [15], the mutual coupling of parallel lines are fully com-
pensated by using the zero-sequence currents. In [16], a new
algorithm has been developed only for detection of cross-
country non-earthed faults that occurs in the first zone of par-
allel lines. Authors presented a double-circuit distance protec-
tion for single line to ground faults while other fault types
have been neglected in this study.

In this paper an intelligent method is presented for the
parallel transmission line protection. The proposed method
is composed of two important steps. In the first step, the fault
type is determined by using the probabilistic neural network
(PNN) which is trained based on the measured current signals
at both sides as well as the status of circuit breakers. Then, in
the second step, the fault location is estimated by using ANNs
which are separately trained for each fault type. The proposed
algorithm has some advantages from following viewpoints:

¢ The complete parallel lines protection is realized by im-
plementation of both fault detection and fault location.

¢ All operating conditions of parallel lines are considered
especially when the switched off line is grounded at both
sides.

e All fault types are located with high accuracy due to se-
lection of meaningful features.

¢ The proposed algorithm is very fast so that the fault loca-
tion can be detected in less than 5 msec.

e Variable parameters such as fault resistance, fault type and
fault location have negligible effect on the proposed algo-
rithm accuracy.

¢ A separate ANN is utilized for estimation of the zero se-
quence current of the line which is disconnected and
grounded at both sides.

¢ The transient behavior of current transformer (CT) and
capacitor voltage transformer (CVT) does not degrade
the performance of the proposed protection scheme.

Need for a New Algorithm

As mentioned in the introduction section, the distance relays
have been designed to be the main protection of the transmis-
sion lines. The positive sequence impedance that is measured
at the relay location form the operation basis of the distance
protection, because it appears in all fault types [17—19]. In the
parallel operating mode, when both lines are in-service, the
relay input current should be compensated to calculate the
Technol Econ Smart Grids Sustain Energy (2020) 5:14

positive sequence impedance, correctly. This is easily accom-
plished because both parallel line currents are accessible in
this condition. The most challenging issue in parallel lines
protection arises when one line is disconnected and grounded
at both sides while a single phase to ground fault occurs on the
line in-service. In this situation, the mutual zero sequence
impedance appears in the sequence matrix while the current
of disconnected line is not accessible due to the CT location in
the substation. Thus, in this situation, the calculation of the
positive sequence impedance at the relay location is impossi-
ble [17]. In the following, the fault location for parallel trans-
mission lines based on the distance protection scheme 1s brief-
ly discussed in different operating conditions.

When one line is disconnected at one end or it is discon-
nected at both ends and not grounded, the line in-service can
be considered as a single circuit line because no current can
pass through disconnected line. Thus, the same conventional
distance protection algorithm can be applied while the positive
sequence impedance is calculated as given in eq. (1) [17, 19]:

where Kp = (Zo — Z)/Z}.

On the other hand, when both parallel lines are in-service,
eq. (1) can be used for calculation of the positive sequence
impedance when the single line to ground fault occurs on the
line in-service. The following modification is made to the
relay input current because of the zero sequence coupling
between parallel lines [17].

Thus, access to zero sequence current of adjacent line is
necessary for the calculation of the positive sequence

impedance at the relay location. Since both lines are in-ser-
vice, CTs are able to measure the line currents so that J, and
[9 can be easily calculated.

In the next operating mode, as shown in Fig. 1, line Y is
disconnected and grounded at both ends while a single line to
ground fault occurs on the line X which 1s in-service. For this
condition, the corresponding zero sequence circuit connection
of parallel lines is as shown in Fig. 2. In this situation, the zero
sequence current of the disconnected line i.e. [9 is not acces-
sible because CTs are located behind the circuit breakers.
According to zero sequence circuit of parallel lines in Fig. 2,
Jo can be found as follows [17]:

y
Zmot (1-p)Zs0-Z,0 )

0 = Zo{(1-p)Zo + Zo}-(1-p)Z. ee 8)

where Z,o and Z,9 are zero sequence impedances of power
supplies at both sides of lines and p is the fault location in
percent. As can be seen in equation (3), [9 is dependent on the
fault location (p) and the zero sequence impedances of power
supplies (Z,0, Z,).

It should be noted that the fault location is unknown and
also source impedances can be changed according to the net-
work topology and power system operation. Moreover, the
fault resistance can affect the zero sequence current of the
faulty line and consequently can impact on the zero sequence
current of the adjacent line. It should be noted that J, as
calculated in (3) is a function of the fault location (p) that is
the main unknown of the problem. Thus, the calculation of the
positive sequence impedance of the faulty line is not possible
by using equations (1) and (3). Therefore, based on the given
descriptions in this section, a new algorithm for fault location
is an urgent necessity to protect parallel lines under different
operational conditions.

Proposed Method

As described in section 2, the inefficiency of the conventional
distance protection has been justified for parallel lines protec-
tion. The main difficulty arises when one of the circuit is
disconnected and grounded at both sides. In this study, a
two-stage intelligent method is designed in order to propose
a comprehensive protection scheme. At the first stage, the

[17]

fault detection is performed and in the second stage the fault
location is realized through measurement currents at both
sides. In the following subsections, each stage is described
in details.

Fault Type Classification

In order to detect the fault type in parallel lines protection, the
measured currents at both sides are very helpful as used in line
differential protection schemes [3, 4]. Due to access to both
sides’ currents of the line in-service, the angle and magnitude
of measured currents can be easily obtained by using discrete
Fourier transform (DFT). The current angle difference of each
phase forms the elements of input vectors of the exemplar
patterns [20].

When the lines are in the normal situation, the angle differ-
ence between measured currents of the same phase of each
line at both sides is about 180 degrees. The main reason of this
difference is the currents direction at both sides of the line. The
simulation results prove that under different conditions, the
angle difference between same phases remains about 180 de-
grees. On the other hand, during fault conditions, the angle
difference is no longer near 180 degrees due to the change of
current direction. However, healthy phases still are maintained
180 degree angle difference. When a fault occurs outside of
the under protection line, the angle difference is near to the
180 degree and the algorithm does not identify any fault.
Therefore, one of the great advantages of the proposed intel-
ligent fault detection scheme is the removal of relay
overreaching which is an important matter for protection of
parallel lines. In addition, when an earth fault occurs on the
transmission line, the zero sequence current will appear in the
sequences equivalent circuit. Thus, the zero sequence current
can be used as a meaningful feature for detection of earth
faults. For this reason, magnitudes of zero sequence currents
of both lines in-service are used as other important features to
determine whether the fault involves earth or not.

In the proposed intelligent fault detection method, the well-
known classifier 1.e. PNN is used as the detection core to

identify the fault type. PNN estimates the class probability
of an input vector using the probabilistic density function
(PDF) of each class and then the class with the highest poste-
rior probability is allocated based on Bayes’ rule. Since the
fast clearance time of faults has a great impact on power sys-
tem stability, the proposed fault detection is of great impor-
tance. The proposed fault detection method is able to detect
the fault in about 5 msec. This time is the interval between
preparing input data to ANN and the instant the decision is
made by ANN as the output.

Overall, eight features are considered for each input vector.
Six of them are related to the current angle difference of each
phase and two features are zero-sequence current measured at
the relay location. PNN outputs are labelled with 21 different
classes as given in Table 1. It should be noted that when one of
the lines is out-of-service and grounded on both ends (this
situation can be detected based on status of circuit breakers),
another PNN is used for fault type detection. This PNN is
separately trained by only 4 inputs including the current angle
difference of three phases of the line in-service as well as the
corresponding zero sequence current magnitude. The outputs
of this PNN are the first eleven classes specified in Table 1.

Estimation of Fault Location

To completely protect the transmission line, after fault type
determination, it is necessary to find the fault location. It
should be emphasized that the fault location in parallel line
is very complicated due to mutual induction between two
circuits. Moreover, operating modes of parallel lines can affect
the fault location scheme. So, in this study, the nonlinear re-
lation between fault location and available measured signals is
discovered by an intelligent tools.

For each fault type, a separate ANN is used to find the fault
location. The required number of ANNs for each fault type as
well as the related inputs are given separately in Tables 2 and 3
for both operating modes of the protected line. The utilized
parameters in these tables are described in the appendix. The
reason for choosing these special inputs is the dependency of
sequence currents on the fault type. In fact, the selected inputs
depend heavily on the sequence circuit during fault
conditions.

When parallel lines are in-service, for both single-
phase to ground and double-phase to ground faults, zero
sequence currents appear in the sequence circuit of both
lines. Besides, only zero sequence mutual coupling im-
pedance appears in the sequence impedance matrix of
parallel lines. As a result, when ground faults occur,

the impedance seen by the relay is affected by the zero
sequence current of adjacent line.

On the other hand, the zero sequence currents can be help-
ful for estimation of fault location. Since the current measure-
ment is possible for both parallel lines in-service, the ampli-
tude and phase of the zero-sequence currents of both sides of
two parallel lines are used as meaningful features to find the
fault location. As depicted in Table 2, the magnitude and
phase of zero sequence current of both lines Uesim, Lesip.

Leims Leip Lesams Lesap, Lam, Lz2p) are utilized for fault
location.

When one of the parallel lines is out-of-service and ground-
ed at both sides, the line current measurement is not possible
due to the location of CTs. In this condition, in order to have
an accurate estimation of the fault location, the zero sequence
current of the out-of-service line is predicted by an ANN. In
this paper, because of the zero sequence mutual impedance
between parallel lines, the zero sequence current of the line in-
service Uesims Lesip» Ler-ims L1p) 18 used as input of the ANN
for the estimation of the zero sequence current of the adjacent
line -s2m: L-s2p).

Moreover, since the induced current is rather identical
along the out-of-service line, the estimation of zero sequence
current from one side is sufficient. Therefore, two separate

ANNs are needed to predict the amplitude and angle of the

input vector of third ANN for ground fault location (Table 3,

tion detection when ground faults occur.

For both operating modes of parallel lines, positive and
negative sequence currents appear when a phase-to-phase
fault occurs. For this fault type, the zero sequence current does
not appear and consequently no current is induced in the out-
of-service line. In order to estimate the fault location, the pos-

In order to determine the fault location, the selection logic
of ANNs’ inputs is inspired by the distance relay. The distance
relay calculates the positive sequence impedance based on the
equivalent sequence circuit. Therefore, selected inputs for
training of ANNs are dependent to fault type. Moreover, ac-
cording to the parallel lines operating modes, the appropriate
inputs are provided for each ANN. The flowchart of the pro-
posed algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. At first, the status of the
circuit breaker is checked and then the corresponding trained
PNN is used for fault type detection. Then, according to the
fault type, the corresponding ANN is utilized for the estima-
tion of the fault location. It should be noted that the zero
sequence current of the grounded switched-off line is required
to determine the fault location accurately, so it is estimated
using some additional ANNs according to Table 3. The output
of these ANNs includes the magnitude and phase of the zero
sequence current of the line that is out-of-service and ground-
ed at both sides.

Discussion
Evaluation of the Proposed Method

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed protec-
tion scheme for parallel lines, a part of real power system 1s
considered for simulation studies. The test case includes two
parallel lines with length of 100 km as well as two 230 kV
sources with Thevenin impedance at both ends. The parallel
lines structure is shown in Fig. 4 in appendix section. Two
important operating modes of parallel lines are simulated in
the PSCAD/EMTDC environment [21]. In one of the operat-
ing modes, both lines are in-service and in another mode, one
of the lines is switched off and grounded at both ends. All fault
types are applied to seven points of the protected line while
fault resistances of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 (2 are taken into
account for each fault type. Moreover, six different values
of angle difference between power supplies are considered
Le. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 degrees. Totally, 294 different
cases are simulated for each type of fault in each operat-
ing mode of parallel lines. In the proposed method, fault
location estimation is implemented based on the assump-
tion that the fault type is determined in the first step. For
this reason, more than 2000 cases are simulated and tested
for evaluation of the fault type detector. In the first stage
of the proposed method, the direction of lines current is
used for fault type and faulty phase identification. In this
way, the relay overreacheaing is avoided when fault oc-
curs beyond the protected line.

As investigated in section 3, the logic behind the selection
of inputs for fault location estimation is based on the sequence
network. The simulation results are presented in Tables 4 and
5 when both lines are in-service. Moreover, in Tables 6 and 7,
the results are presented for the situation in which one of the
lines is out-of-service and grounded at both sides. The perfor-
mance of the proposed method has been investigated for dif-
ferent fault conditions and some parts of obtained results are
provided in Tables 4 and 6. In the presented results in Tables 4
and 6, it was checked whether the fault type and faulty phase
are correctly detected or not and also the estimated fault loca-
tion is reported in the last column. As it can be seen in Tables 4
and 6, all fault types are detected correctly in the first step. In
the second step of the proposed algorithm, the results related
to fault location estimation are presented in Tables 5 and 7.
Various fault types which occur on seven different points of
the line as well as more than 20 different fault resistances and
sources angle difference are considered in the simulation stud-
ies. The average error of the proposed fault location scheme is
given in Tables 5 and 7 for two simulated operating modes of
parallel lines. It can be seen that for ground faults (single phase
to ground and two phase to ground) the average error for faults
near two ends are greater than those of at the middle of the
line. This is due to the fact that close-in ground faults are fed
from both sides so that the close source injects a greater zero
sequence currant than the farther source. Therefore, the esti-
mation of the zero sequence current of the adjacent line may
be prone to a higher error due to the small zero sequence
current from the far end.

The obtained results show that the maximum average error
for estimation of the fault location is about 0.855 km and the
minimum error is 0.001 km. According to Tables 4 and 6, it is
clearly seen that the proposed method can correctly detect the
faulty phase and fault type. Moreover, the external fault 1.e.
C1-G at 102 km from the relay location can be detected accu-
rately in both operating modes of parallel lines. Also, the last
column of Tables 4 and 6 shows that the maximum estimation
error of the proposed fault location is less than 5%. The aver-
age percentage error given in the last column of Tables 4 and 6
is about 1.23% and 1.19% when both line are in-service and
when the switched off line is grounded at both sides,
respectively.

In Table 8, the proposed algorithm performance is com-
pared to some methods which have been presented for parallel
lines protection in recent years. In several papers, ANNs as a
powerful intelligent tool have been used in various ways
[9-12]. In most articles, attempts have been made to improve
the conventional distance protection operation from aspect of
either fault detection or fault location. But, in the proposed
intelligent method fault detection and fault location are done
simultaneously in separate stages while two main operating
modes of parallel lines are considered. In some papers [8, 10,
11, 15, 16], the fault type and the faulty phases are not iden-
tified and the protection schemes have been founded based on
prior knowledge of the fault type. In most of these papers, the
protection methods have been presented only for fault location
in the case of single-phase to ground faults [10, 15] while in
the first step of the proposed method, the fault type and faulty
phases are detected. Besides, in some articles [7, 15, 16], some
effective factors on parallel lines protection schemes have
been neglected such as line capacitance, fault resistance, angle
differences between sources and etc., but in this research, all

Table 8 Comparison of the proposed method with the some papers

above mentioned parameters are considered in the simulation
studies. Another important attribute of our proposed fault lo-
cation scheme js that, the simulation studies include the single
line to ground faults when switched off line is grounded on
both ends. This important situation has been neglected in
many previously published paper [5, 9-12, 15—17] and they
are applicable when both line are in-service and the current
signals are measurable.

In additions, Table 8 provides comparison results from
view point of estimation accuracy of fault location for some
methods. Table 8 shows that the estimation accuracy of the
fault locators presented in [12, 15, 16] is less than 95% while
our proposed intelligent method is able to estimate the fault
location with accuracy of 100%. Besides, the proposed meth-
od can detect all fault types unlike Refs [10, 15, 16] which are
not equipped with fault detection scheme. It is worth noting
that the high accuracy of fault location estimation is the main
advantage of the proposed method in comparison with the
mentioned methods in Table 8. In the proposed method, the
fault detection accuracy is 100% and the fault location estima-
tion accuracy is 98.8%.

Performance Evaluation Considering CT & CVT Errors

In the real power systems, two important measurement tools
i.e. CT and CVT provide the current and voltage signals for
protective relays, respectively. For line protection, the CT of
TPY class are usually is utilized because it has very low rem-
nant flux about less than 10% of the nominal value. Thus,
during reclosing process, the probability of CT saturation de-
creases significantly, but the ratio and phase errors still exist
because of magnetizing and losses currents. These errors in-
crease during fault conditions and can adversely affect the

detection accuracy of protection schemes. The CT of TYP
class has the maximum ratio and phase errors of 10% and
30 min, respectively [22].

Similarly, capacitor voltage transformers (CVTs) are uti-
lized to provide appropriate voltage signals to relays while
they are equipped with ferroresonance suppression circuit
(FSC). So, they are not affected by transients of power sys-
tems but the same ratio and phase errors appear in the second-
ary output signals. The CVT of class 3P has the ratio and
phase error of +3% and 120 min, respectively for voltages
between 0.05 to 1 times of the nominal value [22].

Therefore, the proposed protection scheme performance is
evaluated considering CT and CVT errors. At first, for differ-
ent 20 cases of each fault type (by combination of five differ-
ent fault resistances including 5, 10, 15 and 20 Q and four
source angle differences of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 degree), the ratio
and phase errors are randomly selected according to the above
mentioned error limits and each error is separately added to
measured current and voltage. Then, the signals contaminated
with errors are used as inputs of the proposed intelligent meth-
od. It should be noted that the same classifiers and regression
tools which have been trained by exemplar patterns extracted
from free-error signals, are utilized for the evaluation purpose.

The obtained results show that in the first stage (fault detec-
tion), the proposed method can detect all faults correctly even
when CT and CVT have transient behavior. On the other hand,

in the second stage (fault location), the mean errors of the fault
distance estimation are calculated and provided. In Table 9, the
results are given for the operating condition when one line is
disconnected and grounded at both sides. The results are provided
for different fault types while fault distance varies between 13 and
91 km from the relay location. In order to provide comparable
results, the estimation accuracy is also presented without consid-
eration of CT and CVT errors. It can be clearly seen that the CT
and CVT errors have little impact on the accuracy of the proposed
intelligent fault location algorithm. In the worst condition, the
mean error for single-phase to ground fault at distance of
13 km, increases from 5.406% to 7.211%. In other fault locations,
the effect of measurement errors is ignorable.

Moreover, similar results are provided in Table 10 when
both lines are in-service. In all fault distances, the calculated
estimation error for both scenarios i.e. with and without con-
sideration of CT and CVT errors are very similar. Thus, the
obtained results justify the robustness of the proposed intelli-
gent fault location scheme to measurement errors that are in-
evitable in real power systems.

Conclusions

In this paper, a new intelligent method has been pre-
sented for the complete protection of parallel

transmission lines. In the proposed method, two main
operating modes of parallel lines are considered 1.e.
when both lines are in-service and when one of the
lines is out-of-service and grounded on both sides. In
the first step, the fault type as well as faulty phase are
identified using a trained PNN. In the second step, the
fault location is estimated with the help of several
ANNs. The main attribute of the proposed protection
scheme is that, the current of the disconnected line
which is grounded at both sides is estimated by some
ANNs for ground faults on the line in-service because
of the mutual zero sequence impedance between parallel
lines. Thus, the main attribute of the proposed protec-
tion scheme is that, the faults can be located when the
disconnected line is grounded at both sides. For each
type of fault, a set of certain features are considered
to obtain the desirable accuracy. These features have
been extracted based on the sequence currents that ap-
pear in different fault conditions. Simulation results jus-
tify the priority of the proposed method in both aspects
of fault type detection and fault location estimation. The
proposed protection algorithm is able to detect all fault
types correctly and also it yields the average error of
about 1.2% for fault location estimation. Moreover, the
accuracy of the proposed intelligent protection scheme
is not affected by CT and CVT errors. Therefore, the
proposed algorithm can be used in the practical appli-
cations as an effective method for parallel lines protec-
tion. It should be mentioned that the proposed protec-
tion method is applicable only for parallel lines which
contribute in the training process.
