Rollable photonic devices that can adapt to freeform surfaces with reduced dimensions while maintaining their original
functionalities are highly desirable. Among photonic devices, metamaterials with hyperbolic dispersion in momentum space,
defined as hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM), possess a large photonic density of states that has been proven to boost light-matter
interaction. However, these devices are mainly developed on rigid substrates, restricting their functionalities. Here, we present the
attempt to integrate flexible and rollable HMMs consisting of polymer and metal multilayers on paper substrate. Quite interestingly,
this design enables to exhibit high photonic density of states and scattering efficiency to enhance stimulated emission and induce
pronounced laser action. The flexible and rollable HMM structure remains well its functionalities on freeform surfaces with curvature
radius of 1 mm, and can withstand repeated bending without performance degradation. The intensity of laser action is enhanced
by 3.5 times as compared to the flat surface. We anticipate that this flexible and rollable HMM structure can serve as a diverse
platform for flexible photonic technologies, such as light-emitting devices, wearable optoelectronics, and optical communication.

INTRODUCTION

With the development of photonics, there has been a push
towards optoelectronic devices that are flexible, rollable, wearable,
user-friendly, and robust to improve human-machine interfaces”.
To be integrated onto human body, these devices must be
biocompatible and be able to withstand mechanical deformation
and different bending curvatures**. This promising market of
wearable photonics and optoelectronics has inspired a number of
demonstrations such as flexible photodetectors”, stretchable laser
systems°, artificial electronic skins*, paper-based memory
devices’, and flexible optoelectronic fibers and textiles®”''. The
developed flexible photonic devices possess advanced function-
alities beyond their rigid counterparts. In order to successfully
integrate with wearable photonic systems, the flexible and rollable
optoelectronic devices have to contain several important features,
such as biocompatibility, high sensitivity, low energy loss, long-
term endurance, etc. Undoubtedly, there remains a number of
challenges to achieve the above-mentioned functionalities for the
realization of practical applications.

Photonic metamaterials offer a number of promising properties
suitable for wearable optoelectronic devices. Metamaterials are
designed with sub-wavelength dimensions to control or tailor the
electromagnetic waves for diverse functionalities '*. Through the
artful design of appropriate geometric patterns, a variety of
metamaterials-based structures have been demonstrated, such as
epsilon-near zero (ENZ) systems'*'*, metaholograms'’, and
metalenses'®. A special class of metamaterials is a hyperbolic
metamaterial (HMM), defined by its hyperbolic iso-frequency
surface in momentum space'’. HMM provides an excellent
platform to sustain a large density of high wave-vector modes
inside its artificial structure'’. Subsequently, the photonic density
of states (PDOS) is increased as confirmed by the Fermi’s golden

rule'®. In general, the compositions of HMMs are alternating
metal-dielectric multilayers '’, ordered arrays of metallic nanowires
in a dielectric medium'”, or the nanoscale core-shell Au/SiO, with
alternating multishells*°. HMMs have been used as an extremely
sensitive platform for bio-sensors at ultralow diluted concentra-
tions?’ and reaching a thresholdless Cherenkov radiation to
explore the possibility of free-electron light source*’. As for light-
matter interactions, HMMs have been proven to boost the
transition rates for both of the spontaneous and _ stimulated
emission dynamics** *’. For spontaneous emission, the nano-
patterned structures of HMMs can strongly out-couple the energy
with a large enhancement factor*®. Owing to the increased
transition rate of the optical gain media, stimulated emission (e.g.,
laser action) comes along with a strong output power and a
reduced lasing threshold*”*?°°. However, these demonstrations
have primarily been done on rigid substrates. Previously, there
exists only one demonstration of flexible HMMs on polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) substrate, however the limited curvature
radius of 20mm reduces its potential application in flexible
photonic systems® '. To fully explore the excellent functionalities of
HMM, large degree of flexibility and even rollability are highly
desirable, which remains as a challenge issue. Particularly, rollable
devices possess several advantages over rigid substrates, such as
lighter weight, thinner dimensions, and can be perfectly rolled
and stored compactly.

Here, we design and fabricate the flexible and rollable polymer-
based HMM on a paper substrate. The flexible and rollable HMM is
composed of biocompatible materials: gold (Au) and poly(methy!
methacrylate) (PMMA). The constituent materials are arranged ina
lamellar multilayer structure to achieve its extremely anisotropic
effective permittivity. To realize the usefulness of our design, we
demonstrate that the flexible and rollable HMM is able to enhance

free structure, speckle-free imaging, etc>’”*°. Potential applications
for random laser action span from biological probes*’ and white
light illumination?”*® to the integration with stretchable and
flexible optoelectronic devices®. Here, we choose low-dimensional
organic—inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) as the gain
medium. The PNC is composed of methyl-ammonium lead
bromide (MAPbBrs3) with a bandgap of ~2.3 eV, which can achieve
a high quantum efficiency up to ~90.5%°° and serve as light out-
coupling management in light-emitting diodes*°*". Interestingly,
the enhanced laser action based on our flexible and rollable HUM
maintains superior stable performance even under cyclic bending
to curvatures below 1mm. Finally, when the HMM devices
become flexible and rollable, numerous applications can be
explored. For example, a highly sensitive bio-sensor can detect the
immediate bold glucose on any freeform surfaces of human skin
and the biocompatible HMM devices can be implanted into
human to enhance the emission of upconversion nanoparticles for
in vivo bio-image application. Therefore, the study shown here
provides an alternative for the exploration of both scientific
research and industrial interest based on the integrations of
metamaterials with flexible and rollable technology.

RESULTS

Proof-of-concept design of the flexible and rollable HMM

To prove the concept of flexible and rollable HMM structure that
can be applied to the flexible and rollable applications, Fig. 1a
presents the schematic diagram of the flexible and rollable HMM
structure on a paper substrate. A thin layer of polydimethylsilox-
ane (PDMS) was spin-coated on the paper substrate to prevent

unwanted roughness due to its textured surface. In order to
compare the enhancement factor of the laser action owing to the
different hyperbolic dispersion effect of the HMM substrate, we
compare two sets of Au/PMMA multilayer with the thickness 25/
40 nm (HMM1) as well as 25/30nm (HMM2) for four pairs. The
flexible and rollable HMM device can be easily rolled by a tweezer
as shown in Fig. 1b. Figure 1c, d shows the cross-sectional field-
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the
HMM1 (HMM2) sample, which shows a uniform multilayer
structure. To determine the bandwidth of hyperbolic dispersion
of the HMM (i.e., €1€) < 0), we use the effective medium theory to
calculate the optical tensors to match the hyperbolic dispersion'’:

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, and the subscripts of +
and || are perpendicular and parallel to the anisotropy axis. Figure
le shows the iso-frequency curves of the flexible and rollable
HMM at the wavelength of 530 nm to match the central emission
wavelength of PNCs. Both of the HMM1 and HMM2 are Type Il
hyperbolic dispersion**. The detailed calculation methods of
effective dielectric tensors are shown in Supplementary Note 1
and Supplementary Fig. 1. The enhanced emission dynamics can
be explained by the increased PDOS that can out-couple the
energy to free space with a higher scattering efficiency.

To realize the effect of thermal expansion mismatch among
paper/PDMS/Au, we analyzed the material characterizations as
shown in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2. The
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of PDMS is 3.1 x 10°-*°C”'*°,
which can cause the deposited Au thin film to have wrinkles on the
surface. This unwanted wrinkled Au surface can be avoided by
carefully control of sample temperature during deposition process,
e.g., we used the thermal evaporation under a vacuum pressure of
~1x10°° Torr at room temperature and the deposition rate is

HMM1 is 40nm and HMM2 is 30nm, was spin-coated on the
surface of Au not only to serve as the multilayer component of
HMM structure but also can be the encapsulation to equalize the
residual stress due to CTE mismatch**. Furthermore, we spin-
coated the PNCs onto the HMM devices at a rate of 2000 rpm for
30s and then we baked these devices at 50 °C for 10 min to volatile
toluene. Such low temperature will not affect the thermal
expansion of the device.

Emission dynamics

To explore the properties of the HMM structures, we spin-coated
the PNCs on top of the substrates. The high-resolution transmis-
sion electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of the PNC (with a
radius of ~10 nm) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. Figure 2a-c
shows the emission spectra of PNCs on the HMM1 (HMM2 and
glass substrate). The insets are the corresponding lifetime
measurements. All the spectra were measured by a 374nm
pulsed diode laser at room temperature. The spectra exhibit many
randomly distributed sharp peaks, indicating the occurrence of
random laser action. The mechanism of random laser action can
be realized as follows. The stacking of PNCs with a certain size
distribution on top of the substrates provides a platform to trap
the light traveling in the PNCs gain media because of multiple
scattering, and the high photonic density of states (PDOS) from
the HMM substrate is beneficial for the excitation of PNCs. With
this feature, the formation of coherent closed loops can occur, the
optical gain is increased due to the multiple scattering process in
between the PNCs, the weak signal can be enhanced and the
spectrum becomes broader*’. When the optical gain overcomes
its loss, lasing peaks with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)
less than 1nm are observed, which is the signature of random

laser action. These spectra reveal that several sharp leasing peaks
are randomly emerged with uncertain numbers, positions, and
intensities on the top of broad emission bands*°. The morphol-
ogies with randomly distributed PNCs are useful to form the
closed-loop paths by trapping the light to further enlarge the
optical gain by the happening of multiple scattering process for
the emitted photons from PNCs. The stimulated emission of PNCs
is subsequently enhanced to achieve the random laser action.
Besides, the PNCs on top of the HMM substrate are relatively
rough, which is beneficial to extract the trapped photons out of
the HMM substrate.

Emission lifetime dynamics are also important for random laser
action. Figure 2d, e show the maximum emission intensity of the
lasing peaks and FWHM as a function of pumping energy density.
A flat slope with a broad FWHM of 10-15nm is typical for
spontaneous emission before lasing. When increasing the pump-
ing energy density, the slope climbs sharply and the FWHM of
each lasing peak is reduced to less than 1 nm. The intersection of
these two slopes (hollow circle) is the lasing threshold for the
HMM1 (HMM2 and glass substrate) of 0.27 (0.22 and 0.30) kW
cm 7. Note that the lasing threshold for the HMM1 (HMM2) is 10%
(27%) reduced and the emission intensity is 1.2 (2.8) times
stronger compared with the PNCs on glass substrate. The spatial
profiles of random laser systems are quite different than the
traditional lasers, which possess with a variety of sharp peaks
owing to the existence of many coherent closed loops around the
gain media. The calculation method of the temporal coherence
length (L) is based on the following formula of L = c(nAf)~', where
c,n, and Af are the velocity of light at vacuum, the refractive index
of the medium, and the frequency bandwidth of the laser action,
respectively*’. Therefore, the temporal coherence length of the
laser action is calculated to have a value of 118.8 um. Additionally,

increases 1.4 (2.5) times. When achieving the random laser action,
the lifetime is dramatically shortened to ~2 ns, as compared to its
spontaneous emission of ~11 ns as shown in Fig. 2f.

The effect of metal duty ratio in HMM also plays an important
role on the performance of random laser action. Compared with
the metal mirror structure, the advantages of HMM are able to
integrate with the quantum emitter inside HMM structure to
achieve enhanced radiative rate for 20 times and can greatly out-
couple light for 100 times to the far-field as compared with typical
method less than 1% of total power*®. Besides, the different metal
duty ratios in HMMs possess the large broadband PDOS with
tunable enhancement factors at desired wavelength regions
across the visible spectrum. Supplementary Figs 4, 5 show the
k-space dissipated power density for different metal duty ratio
without and with considering loss effect, respectively. These
provide strong evidences to demonstrate that the strong inherent
plasmonic modes can exist inside the multilayer structures and
then provide the pronounced light-matter interactions, which is
very beneficial for the formation of random laser action. Therefore,
the above-mentioned benefits provide an excellent platform to
extend the applications and functionalities for photovoltaics,
ultrafast optics and lasers, and quantum optics.

Theoretical analysis

It is well known that multiple scattering of a light beam has a high
chance of forming closed loop paths**. Subsequently, the optical
gain is amplified, which is beneficial to achieve random laser
action®’. The discussion of far-field angular distributions as a
fundamental realization to further explore the practical applica-
tions is necessary, since the devices can be attached to any
freeform surfaces on highly flexible and rollable freeform surfaces
for the real usages. Figure 3a, b show the far-field angular
distribution of the PNCs on the HMM1 and HMM2, respectively.
Supplementary Fig. 6 presents the far-field angular electric field
intensity (|E|*) distributions with a similar trend at the normal
direction. Since the light is scattered in random directions, we
further simulated the tilted angles for 30° and 60° to observe the
far-field |E|? distributions as shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.

npj Flexible Electronics (2020) 20

Supplementary Fig. 8 presents the scattering cross-section at
different incident angles (8) ranging from normal (@ = 0°) to 8 =
33° in the wavelength region of 520-550nm to match the
emission wavelength of the PNCs. Briefly, the HMM2 shows a
stronger scattering intensity no matter it is an individual PNC, two
PNCs or three PNCs as compared with the HMM1 and glass
substrate, which is in agreement with our measurements.

Figure 3c presents the scattering efficiency (scattering intensity
divided by its scattering cross-sectional area) and the mode
volume induced by our designed HMM structures. Within the
emission wavelength region of PNCs (520-550 nm), the scattering
efficiency for the HMM2 is 16% (83%) higher than the HMM1
(glass substrate). We also calculated the effective mode volume
(Var) to investigate the energy confinement. The mode volume is
defined as *7-°!:

Vag — LL SW (2)

ot max W(r)

where W(r) is the energy density of the substrate in free space.
Since Var is dependent on the energy density, a smaller value of
Var¢ results from smaller volume confinement. Additionally, the
shortened closed loop paths result in the reduction of propaga-
tion loss**. The increased energy density for the closed loop paths
provides an excellent platform to produce a strong localization of
electromagnetic fields around the gain media. The transition
probability of the PNCs is therefore enhanced, which enables to
trigger the random laser action with a lower lasing threshold. At
the wavelength of 530nm, the mode volume of the glass
substrate (HMM1 and HMM2) is 0.123 (0.045 and 0.036) um?.
That is, the mode volume for the HMM2 is 20% (71%) smaller than
the HMM1 (glass substrate). Supplementary Fig. 9 is the energy
distributions of the top-view profiles, showing the HMM2 confines
the energy more strongly. Therefore, the reduction of light
propagation loss is critical to achieve random laser action.

From the hyperbolic dispersion of iso-frequency curves (Fig. 1d),
the realization of the out-coupling configuration is discussed as
follows. For both of the HMM samples, the dispersion-relation
curves are hyperbolas, where the emission of the PNCs can benefit

from the hyperbolic dispersion of the multilayer structures. High-
wavevector modes are known to exist when |kymml > |Kair|. The
proposed multilayer HMM structures are Type Il hyperbolic
dispersion (Re(é1 <0) and Re(¢,,) > 0), which belongs to side out-
coupling. The main advantage of using Type Il hyperbolic
dispersion is that the edge out-coupling is very beneficial for
the formation of closed loops in the in-plane direction to boost
the light-matter interaction. Therefore, the coupling effect around
the PNCs is enhanced, and then the threshold of laser action is
reduced.

To explore the light-matter interaction, we also simulated the
Purcell factor (Fi,.) from the perpendicular (F) and parallel (Fj)
dipole sources °7°?:

Figure 3d, e is the Purcell factors with a perpendicular dipole
source above the surface within 30nm for the HMM1 (HMM2),
while Supplementary Figs. 10a, 10b is the corresponding parallel
dipole source. Since the thickness of the PNCs is only ~20 nm, the
influence of Purcell effect from the surface is very pronounced.
The HMM2 shows 60% higher Purcell factor than the HMM1 at the
wavelength of 530 nm, which can be attributed to the excitation
of a higher PDOS. To confirm the above-mentioned concept, we
further simulated the local density of states (LDOS) and
spontaneous decay rate as shown in Fig. 3f, the method of dyadic
Green’s function’. At the wavelength of 530nm, the LDOS and
spontaneous decay rate for the HMM2 are 57 and 62% higher than
the HMM1, respectively, which are very similar to the enhance-
ment from the Purcell effect and the differential quantum
efficiency obtained from emission spectra. Since the Purcell effect,
LDOS, and spontaneous decay rate are achieved the strongest
factors at the emission wavelength of PNCs, the composition of
HMMz2 structure can be considered as the suitable candidate to
enhance the laser action. Furthermore, to prove the influence of

Purcell effect, the k-space dissipated power density without
considering loss effect is calculated as shown in Fig. 4a, b for the
HMM1 and HMM2, respectively. In addition, Fig. 4c, d are the
corresponding dissipated power densities with considering the
loss effect. At the wavelength of 530 nm, especially for the HMM2,
these k-space dissipated power densities show that the strong
inherent plasmonic modes can exist inside the multilayer
structures. These plasmonic modes provide the pronounced
Purcell enhancement effect, which is beneficial for the formation
of random laser action.

Functionalities on freeform surfaces

To explore the curvature realization of the flexible and rollable
HMM, we integrated this HMM device on freeform surfaces for
flexible and wearable characterizations. Figure 5 shows the
emission spectra of random lasing action for the HMM2 device
on the concave glass substrates under the curvature radius of
20mm (Fig. 5a) and 50mm (Fig. 5b), and on the convex glass
substrates under the curvature radius of 20mm (Fig. 5c) and
50mm (Fig. 5d). To demonstrate that our HMM is wearable, we
also integrate the flexible and rollable HMM on a glove as shown
in Supplementary Fig. 11, in which the pronounced laser action
can still be seen. The emission spectra on a convex glass bottle
with the radius curvature of 20 mm (Supplementary Fig. 12) shows
the similar enhancements. All the measurements were performed
under the same pumping energy density of 0.24, 0.20, and
0.13 kW cm * to observe the trends of emission intensities. For the
difference in intensity between Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 12,
it is due to the measurements were at different positions. As
shown in Fig. 5c, the laser spot is located near the scratch of the
HMM structure on the convex glass substrates under the curvature
radius of 20 mm, which is similar to the emission intensities at the
same position on a convex glass bottle under the same curvature
radius (Supplementary Fig. 12a). However, the emission intensities
could drop for 41.7% when the laser spot is located on the off-axis

ment factors of concave and convex substrates as compared with
the planar substrate. The threshold variations with the curvature
radius on the concave, flat, and convex substrates is shown in Fig.
5f. As compared to the flat surface, the threshold is ~28.2% lower
than on the concave substrate and is ~9.5% higher than on the
convex substrate. This is due to the capability of the concave
structure to trap the light through multiple reflections inside the
substrate, which provides an easier way to form feedback loops to
achieve random laser action°’. Especially for the curvature of
20 mm indicates more light can induce the photon trapping inside
the concave substrate, which in turn greatly reduces the loss of
substrate-induced-absorption during the multiple reflections, and
then leads to the amplification of stimulated emission from
PNCs°°. On the contrary, for the decayed emission intensities on
the convex substrates, this phenomenon is due to the less
scattering process in the PNCs and the effect of the PDOS from the
HMM becomes less on the convex substrates to achieve laser
action. Our measured results show that the laser action of PNCs on
the flexible and rollable HMM remains unaffected despite
mechanical deformation. The demonstration of flexible and

wearable characteristics is important to advance the applications
of optoelectronic devices°°>”.

We further demonstrate the functionality of our developed
HMM structures as a feasible rollable photonics usage. Figure 6a
and Supplementary Fig. 13a, b show the lasing performance of
several rolling cycles under the pumping energy density of 0.24,
0.20, and 0.13 kWcm ~~, respectively, indicating the stability of the
devices. Each cycle contains the rolling process (Fig. 6b) and
flattening after rolling (Fig. 6c). The curvature radius of the HMM
under rolling is 1mm. The repeated rolling-flattening processes
were performed with care to prevent the fall off the perovskite
nanocrystals by accident. We further performed the measure-
ments of random lasing action up to 50 times under the pumping
energy density of 0.24, 0.20 and 0.13 kW cm ° as shown in Fig. 6d.
The emission shows an excellent stability without obvious photo-
degradation. This indicates that the flexible and rollable HMM
structure shows the higher emission intensities for the flattening
state as compared to the rolling state, in which the light will be
dissipated on the rolling side of the HMM structure. The
fluctuation of spectra is the typical feature of random laser action.
On the other hand, the results from Fig. 5 are the measurements

of steady flexible and rollable HMM structure on the concave or
convex substrates without suffering any repeated deformation,
resulting in the less possible degradation of the HMM structure
inside the multilayer components. Hence the emission intensities
in Fig. 5 show the relative stable emission intensities. Supple-
mentary Fig. 14 show the corresponding lasing spectra with
further increasing cycle index up to 50 times. Since the PNCs are
decorated on the rollable HMM, the rolling structure may provide
a feasible manner to trap light in the rolled device for coherent
laser action to occur more easily, and resulting in more
pronounced sharp peaks. In addition, the mode volume of the
rollable HMM is reduced with decreasing curvature radius, which
is beneficial to enhance scattering and reduce propagation loss.
Ultimately, this cyclic testing shows that our devices may be
integrated on frequently deformed substrates without device
performance degradation, which is very beneficial for the practical
fabrics usage owing to its excellent tolerance property in
mechanical force. Figure 6e shows broad angular emissions
intensities from 10° to 60° and the trend is very similar to the
normalized intensity of far-field angular emission at the center
position of far-field monitor (Supplementary Fig. 15) and
Supplementary Fig. 16 shows the corresponding spectra, which
is another characteristic to firm the occurrence of random laser
action. Certainly, the spectra of far-field angle emission are simply
changing the tilted angle of sample holder, and the detected
beam is collected by the same objective lens (Fig. 6e). These
spectra were collected by the Horiba Jobin Yvon TRIAX
320 spectrometer with 50x (Olympus, Japan), in which the
emissions are reflected by the mirrors many times before it
reaches to the optical fiber and then to the detector systems
(Supplementary Fig. 17). To further demonstrate the broad
angular emissions, we perform the measurements at different
emission directions as shown in Supplementary Fig. 18, where the
emissions are collected by an optical fiber near the HMM sample
and then the spectra are analyzed by the OCEAN OPTICS HR2000
+CG. Note that the detector used to measure the different
emission directions is different than the Horiba Jobin Yvon TRIAX

320 spectrometer, as well as the numbers of passing through or
reflected by the mirrors are different. The laser action can
be observed up to 50° under the pumping energy density of
0.24 kW cm °.

We performed the laser exposure to observe the morphology of
PNCs as shown in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.
19. We can observe the stability of PNCs without any decomposi-
tion or degradation on the HMM2 substrate even under
continuously laser expose at pumping energy density of
0.24 kW cm * for 60 min of the laser irradiation. The temperature
at laser spot only increases 0.6 °C (in Supplementary Fig. 20). This
slightly increment of temperature may be attributed to the fact
that both of the HMM1 and HMM2 samples are composed of Au
thin layer up to 100 nm in total thickness, which could dissipate
the heat accumulation in the interface between PNCs and HMM
samples’. In general, the PNCs present unstable performances
above 85°C even in the inert atmosphere®'. So the laser source
induced degradation can be neglected in our measurement of
random laser action. Furthermore, we performed the measure-
ment with laser exposure of PNCs on HMM2 substrate for
continuously 60 min at the pumping energy density of 0.24 kW
cm~? as shown in Fig. 6f. No spectral shifts are observed,
demonstrating that the PNCs remain intact without any decom-
posed resulting in the higher binding energy during the laser
irradiation®”™.

The HMM device, i.e., flexible and rollable polymer-based HMM,
is composed of Au and PMMA, which are biocompatible materials,
including the paper substrate. MAPbBr3 was spin-coated on the
flexible and rollable HMM device to perform the measurement of
random laser action to prove the preliminary function to enhance
the light-matter interaction. Note that the flexible and rollable
HMM on a paper substrate can serve as an alternative towards
smart fabrics with the following anticipation. First, the flexible and
rollable HMM is composed of the high elasticity and super
hydrophobicity polymers that makes it to integrate with the
fabrics materials as a firm, impermeable and wear-resistant
photonic skin (p-skin) and electronic skin (e-skin) component.

Eco-friendly and disposable characterizations, low-cost fabrication,
lightweight, and the control of surface wettability and surface free
energy to eliminate the external flow effect from the atmosphere
as a packaging protection, the chosen paper as a substrate is
foreseeable for the development of rollable photonics. Since the
ultra-sensitivity of the nano-patterned HMM structure, this device
on a paper substrate can be even used for in vivo implantable
biosensors and detecting explosive molecules on freeform surface.
Finally, the demonstration of this work provides an excellent
platform to widely explore the research highlights for rollable
photonics and smart fabrics.

DISCUSSION

We have successfully demonstrated HMM structures composed of
Au/PMMA on paper substrate with flexible and rollable character-
istics. This flexible and rollable HMM structures show hyperbolic
dispersion in the momentum space to enlarge the PDOS, which
enables to enhance the optical gain and boost the stimulated
emission (e.g., random laser action) from PNCs. By tuning the
thickness of the HMM structure, we have achieved a large
enhancement of the density of states and the scattering efficiency.
Simulation results based on the scattering efficiency and the
dipole-like dynamics confirm an efficient out-coupling. Remark-
ably, owing to its flexibility and rollability, the HMM structure still
works well on freeform surfaces with curvature radius of 1mm
during cyclic testing. Our demonstration of flexible and rollable
HMM structures therefore provides a great promise for applica-
tions in multifunctional and wearable optoelectronic devices.

METHODS

Fabrication of the flexible and rollable HMM

We used a paper as our flexible and rollable HMM substrate. Paper with
size of ~2 cm x 2 cm is attached to the glass substrate for the following
spin-coating process. To avoid the unwanted roughness from the textured
surface of the paper substrate, a thin layer of PDMS was spin-coated on the
paper/glass substrate at a rate of 2000 rpm, and then the sample was
cured for 40min at 100°C on a hotplate. After that, to prepare the
multilayer structures, we deposited Au thin film on the top of PDMS layer
using the thermal evaporation under a vacuum pressure of ~1 x 10° Torr
at the deposition rate of 0.5 As '. We dissolved PMMA into acetone at a
mass fraction of 25 wt% and then stirred this solution for 2 h at room
temperature to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To prepare the HMM1 and
HMM2 with different thickness of PMMA, we spin-coated the solution at a
rate of 3000 (5000) rpm to get the thickness of 40 (30) nm, and then cured
the sample for 20 min at 100°C on a hotplate. We continuously repeated
this process for three times to obtain four pairs of HMM1 and HMM2
devices.

Materials characterization of the flexible and rollable HMM

The characterization of the multilayer structures of the HMM1 and HMM2
devices was performed by the focused ion beam (FIB) system (Helios
Nanolab 660 DualBeam) at 30 kV and 50 pA of Gallium ion source. Then, we
used the FE-SEM system to record the images at a tilted holder angle of
52°.

Measurement of emission spectra and the corresponding lifetime

The emission spectra of random laser action were measured by a pulsed
diode laser (Picoquant, PDL 800-B) with a central wavelength of 374 nm,
pulsed duration of 70 ps and repetition rate of 2.5 MHz. The emission
spectra and lifetime dynamics were recorded by a Horiba Jobin Yvon TRIAX
320 spectrometer with 50x (Olympus, Japan) objective. The resolution of
the spectrometer is 0.1mm. Since the laser action is related to the
dynamics of charge carrier mechanism, we used the time-correlated single
photon counting (TCSPC) for data acquisition to perform the lifetime
measurements, which is a commonly used method. TCSPC is to measure
the time difference between the excitation signal from the sample and the
emitted photons arrival to the detector. Finally, the lifetime was estimated
using the fitting software (FluoFit, PicoQuant). This measurement is

npj Flexible Electronics (2020) 20

repeated under different pumping density to realize the lifetime of random
laser action. We also used OCEAN OPTICS HR2000+CG with a 0.47 nm in
spectral resolution to measure the different emission directions from the
HMM sample.

Preparation of the PNCs

We repeated the method from the previous report to synthesize the
CH3NH3PbBr3 PNCs°°. First, 96 uL of oleic acid was mixed with 2 mL of
octadecene, and then this solution was stirred and heated at 80°C ona
hotplate. Next, 0.06 mmol of octylammonium bromide (Shanghai Mater-
Win New Materials) was added into this solution and then another 200 uL
of N,2-dimethylformamide. 0.04mmol of methylammonium bromide
(Shanghai MaterWin New Materials) was then added into the solution
followed by the mixture of 0.1mmol of leadi(Il) bromide. This as
synthesized PNCs possesses an extremely strong photoluminescence,
which is necessary for laser action on the HMM device. To integrate the
PNCs onto the device, we dissolved the PNCs into toluene with a
concentration of 10 mg mL! at room temperature followed by stirring it
for 1h to get a homogenous mixture. Then, we spin-coated this solution
on the HMM devices at a rate of 2000 rpm for 30s. Finally, we baked these
devices at 50°C for 10 min to volatile toluene.

Instrumentation detail of HR-TEM

The HR-TEM image of the as-synthesized PNCs was carried out using
TECNAI G2 FEG-TEM operating at 300 kV.

Numerical simulation

The simulation results were performed by using a commercial electro-
magnetic software (Lumerical) of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
Solutions. The refractive index of PMMA was set to be 1.49 and Au was
from Johnson and Christy®. Since the PNCs used is composed of
CH3NH3PbBr3, so we used the complex refractive indices (n+ ik) of
refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) from Alias et al. as shown
in Supplementary Fig. 21°°. At the emission center of PNCs at the
wavelength of 530 nm, the n and k are 2.1 and 0.2, respectively. To avoid
the unwanted numerical results owing to the boundary conditions, we
used the perfectly matched layers to cover the entire computational
regions. The simulation settings of far-field angular distribution, scattering
and Purcell factors (from Supplementary Notes 4-7 and from Supplemen-
tary Figs. 22-26).
