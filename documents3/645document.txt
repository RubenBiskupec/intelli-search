Abstract

Multiple description coding (MDC) provides a favorable solution for human-centered
image communication, which takes into account people’s varying watching situations
as well as people’s demand for real-time image display. As an effective technique for
MDC, three-description lattice vector quantization (3D-LVQ) is considered for image
coding in this paper. Based on intra- and inter-correlation in the 3D-LVQ index
assignment as well as wavelet intra-subband correlation, a novel predictive decoding

method for 3D-LVQ-based image coding is proposed to enhance side decoding
performance, which attempts to predict lost descriptions (sublattice points) in a good
way for better reconstructions of wavelet vectors (fine lattice points) in the side
decoding. Experimental results validate effectiveness of the proposed decoding
scheme in terms of rate-distortion performance.

1 Introduction

The revolutionary computing technology advances have changed almost every aspect of
human lives [1]. However, these changes intended to be positive are not always so. Since
a lot of computing technologies are designed ignorant of human’s needs or social cul-
tural contexts, these technologies are complex, difficult to use, and demanding, especially
for ordinary people who do not possess skilled knowledge [1]. These issues bring a need
to develop new computing paradigms that focus more on people instead of machines.
Human-centered computing (HCC) [2-9] aims to bridge gaps between multiple disci-
plines and tries to design and implement the computing systems that support human
endeavor.

According to [1], HCC system and algorithm design needs to take into account indi-
vidual human abilities and limitation, social and cultural awareness, and the adaptability
across individuals and specific situations, for example, designing recommender systems
or recommending services that consider individual’s social and cultural context [10-17].
An interesting topic in multimedia applications in HCC is the adaptation of multimedia

communication to varying demands of different people, whose communication chan-
nels may have varying bandwidth and loss probabilities. When packet loss occurs during
online image browsing, people tend to prefer viewing a degraded version of a whole image
immediately instead of waiting and staring at a partially displayed fine image. The design
of human-centered image coding scheme that takes into account people’s varying watch-
ing situations as well as people’s demand for real-time image display is a challenging
problem.

Multiple description coding (MD coding or MDC) [18] provides a favorable solution
to this problem. Although the reliability of multimedia communication can be improved
from the perspective of multicore real-time system design [19-21] or load balancing of
cloud-edge computing [22—27], MDC offers an error-resilient source coding method to
combat information loss over lossy networks without retransmission. MDC generates
different encoded versions for the same source. Each version is referred to as a descrip-
tion and transmitted separately over unreliable networks. Each description can provide a
degraded version of the source independently, while a finer reconstruction quality can be
obtained with increasing number of descriptions received. Generally, the decoding of one
or partial descriptions is known as side decoding corresponding to side distortions, while
the decoding of all the descriptions is central decoding resulting in a central distortion
[28]. Using MDC, people with varying bandwidth can select different number of descrip-
tions that correspond to different reconstruction qualities. During network congestion,
people can get access to a coarsely reconstructed source immediately, instead of waiting
for retransmission of all the lost packets.

Vaishampayan introduced the earliest practical MD technique known as multiple
description scalar quantizer (MDSQ) [29]. MDSQ generates descriptions by performing
scalar quantization, followed by an index assignment. A wavelet image coding based on
MDSQ was developed in [30]. Another wavelet-based MD image coding scheme is pro-
posed in [31] for image transmission with mixed impulse noise, where multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the side quantization optimization problem and
the parameter optimization problem of the denoising filter simultaneously.

Multiple description lattice vector quantization (multiple description LVQ or MDLVQ)
was later developed in [32], and a study on optimal MDLVQ design was presented in
[33]. MDLVQ generates descriptions by performing vector quantization first, and then, an
index assignment maps a fine lattice point to multiple sublattice points. An image coding
scheme based on two-description LVQ was developed in [34], which shows better coding
performance than the corresponding MDSQ-based counterpart [30]. In [35], the design of
M-description LVQ is investigated, where the MDLVQ index assignment design is trans-
lated into a transportation problem. The effectiveness of the proposed index assignment
design in [35] is verified under high-resolution assumption. In [36], an analytical expres-
sion for optimal entropy-constrained asymmetric MDLVQ design is presented, which
allows unequal packet-loss probabilities and side entropies. In [37], the design of symmet-
ric MD coinciding LVQ is proposed, where the coinciding sublattices refer to sublattices
with the same index but generated by different generator matrices. The developed MD
coinciding LVQ scheme is applied to standard test images.

Other MD schemes include using forward error correction codes [38], MDC via
polyphase transform and selective quantization [39], set partitioning of hierarchical trees
(SPHIT)-based image MDC [40], and a JPEG 2000-based MD approach presented in [41].
Xu EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:93 Page 3 of 14

In [42], a just noticeable difference (JND)-based MD image coding scheme is proposed
utiltizing the charactersitics of human visual model. In [43], an adaptive reconstruction-
based MD image coding scheme is proposed with randomly offset quantizations. Deep
learning approaches [44] have been applied in the MDC. In [45], a standard-compliant
multiple description coding framework is proposed, where the input image is polyphase
downsampled to form two descriptions for the standard codec, while during decoding
deep convolutional neural networks are utilized to conduct artifact removal and image
super-resolution to enhance reconstructed image quality. In [46], MDC and convolutional
autoencoders are combined for image compression to achieve high coding efficiency.

Besides traditional images, a few research works on MDC target at 3D depth images or
single-view and multiview video sequences. In [47], observing that the 3D depth images
have special characteristics, which can be classified into edge blocks and smooth blocks,
a two-description LVQ scheme is proposed for efficient compression of 3D depth images.
In [48], a novel coding scheme has been proposed for video sequences based on the
spatial-temporal masking characteristics of human visual system. In [49], the multiview
sequence is spatial polyphase subsampled and “cross-interleaved” sampling grouped to
generate two subsequences, and an MDC scheme is proposed which directly reuses the
computed modes and prediction vectors of one subsequence to the other one. This work
is extended in [50], where one subsequence is directly coded by joint multiview video
coding (JMVC) encoder, and the other subsequence selectively chooses the prediction
mode and the prediction vector of the coded subsequence to improve the rate-distortion
performance. On the decoder side, the side reconstruction quality is improved using a
gradient-based interpolation.

Among the abovementioned works, most of them center on two-channel MDC or
two-description coding. Comparing with two-description MDC, more-description case
is able to provide better robustness against description loss, especially for networks with
high loss ratios. However, redundancy increases apparently with the increasing num-
ber of descriptions. Three-description coding may thereby be a good trade-off choice
in some cases. On the other hand, compared with MDSQ, MDLVQ exhibits better
coding efficiency and the ease of extension to more-description coding. Therefore, a
three-description lattice vector quantization (3D-LVQ)-based image coding scheme is
considered in this paper.

The general design of 3D-LVQ is concerned with index assignment, which is dis-
cussed in [33] and [51]. Here, we consider how to take good advantage of the index
assignment result for better reconstruction quality in image decoding. For the vec-
tor reconstruction at the decoder side in the case of some descriptions (i.e., sublattice
points in MD-LVQ) being lost, the existing MD-LVQ coding schemes employ a simple
side decoding of each vector individually based on the sublattice points of the vector.
We observe a good correlation characteristic of the 3D-LVQ index assignment result,
which can be exploited to enhance side decoding for memory source. Specifically in the
context of wavelet image coding, a predictive side decoding method is proposed accord-
ingly to improve reconstruction quality in side decoding. Compared with the existing
work in [33, 51] which only decodes the received sublattice points during descrip-
tion losses, the proposed scheme can predict the lost sublattice points based on index
correlation.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
Xu EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:93 Page 4 of 14

e The intra- and inter-correlation between sublattice points in the 3D-LVQ index
assignment has been analyzed and discussed, followed by the correlation discussion of
wavelet intra-subbands.

e Based on correlation discussion, a novel predictive decoding method for 3D-LVQ-
based image coding is proposed to enhance side decoding performance. The performance
of the proposed predictive decoding scheme is verified by experimental results.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a 3D-LVQ-
based image coding scheme. Section 3 presents a novel predictive side decoding approach.
Experimental settings and results are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively, while
Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Three-description LVQ-based image coding
In this section, we first provide a concise description of 3D-LVQ and then present a 3D-
LVQ-based image coding scheme.

2.1 3D-LVQ

For a given lattice A in the L-dimensional Euclidean space, a sublattice A’ C A is said
to be geometrically similar to A, if A’ can be obtained from A by applying a scaling,
rotation, or reflection. The index number N of the sublattice A’ is defined as the number
of elements of A (fine lattice points) in each Voronoi cell of A’. 3D-LVQ aims to map one
fine lattice point A (A € A) to three sublattice points 4, ,A5, and A4 (A4,A45,45 € A’) based

on a bijective labeling function a(.) (also known as index assignment) as:
a(n) = (Af, My A4) (1)

for minimizing the side distortions when only one or two sublattice points are received.
The overall 1-description side distortion D,;,, and the overall 2-description side distor-
tion Ds, are given as:

Desi = WA — Ar||? + A — Aal|? + [A — Agll? (2)

respectively, where the midpoint of two received sublattice points is taken as the recon-
structed vector for the 2-description-based side decoding. The optimal index assignment
design to minimize the side distortions or the expected distortion is a challenging task,
and the index assignment based on A? lattice can be found in [33] and [51]. Figure 1 shows
an example of the labeling function obtained with the index assignment result in [33] and
[51] based on Ag lattice with index number N = 31, which has been shown to minimize
the side distortions. For instance, the lattice point “OAB” in Fig. 1 is represented by the
three sublattice points “O,’ “A,” and “B,’ while another lattice point “BOO” is mapped to
the three sublattice points “B” “O” and “O? In this paper, we consider the 3D-LVQ with
the optimal index assignment as shown in Fig. 1.

2.2 3D-LVQ-based image coding
As in [34], a simple 3D-LVQ-based image encoding scheme is shown in Fig. 2. As a pop-
ular technique for image compression, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can provide

multiresolution representation and subband decomposition for images and capture fea-
ture information in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions [52]. DWT is considered
for image coding in this paper. After applying a DWT to the input image, an input vector
x is constructed in a subband. It is then quantized to a (fine) lattice point A(x) , which is
mapped to three sublattice points A{ (x) , 45(x), and 13(x) to be transmitted in separate
channels after performing arithmetic coding.

At the receiver, decoding is the exact reverse of encoding. Due to network congestion or
channel errors, some channels of information (descriptions) may be lost. Therefore, three
different types of 3D-LVQ decoders may be needed, that is, one-description-based and
two-description-based side decoding as well as three-description-based central decoding.

received, the central decoder yields a7 (Aj (x), A5 (x), 43(x)) = A(x), where a! is the
inverse function of the labeling function a. If two sublattice points are received while one
is lost, the conventional two-description-based side decoder simply takes the average of
the two sublattice points A’ (x) and A(x) (1 <i,j < 3,i #/) as the reconstructed vector:

K = (A(x) + 4400)/2. (4)

In the case of only one sublattice point 1;(x) being received, the conventional one-
description-based side decoder just uses the received sublattice point for the reconstruc-

tion:

XK = N(x). (5)

l

In the following section, We will propose a more effective vector reconstruction method
to improve the side decoding performance by taking advantage of the correlation of sub-
lattice points in the 3D-LVQ index assignment and the wavelet intra-subband correlation
characteristics.

3 3D-LVQ-based predictive side decoding

3.1 Correlation discussion

As can be seen from Fig. 1, each fine lattice point is mapped to an ordered 3-tuple with
the three sublattice points being as close as possible to the fine lattice point for minimiz-
ing side distortions [33, 51]. In this way, we can see that there is a strong intra-correlation
among the three sublattice points for a fine lattice point. More importantly, there exists a
substantial inter-correlation among neighboring fine lattice points in terms of their cor-
responding sublattice points. In other words, neighboring fine lattice points share most
sublattice points in the index assignment. In Fig. 1, for instance, the fine lattice point
labeled as “OOA’ shares at least two sublattice points with its six closest neighbors “AOO,’
“OAO, “BOO, “OAB,’ “AOB,’ and “OAF,’ regardless of the order. Statistically, we observe
from the figure that the immediately neighboring fine lattice points have the same three
sublattice points (but in different order) with a probability of 78/186, while they share two
sublattice points with a probability of 108/186. That is to say, these immediately neigh-
boring fine lattice points share at least two sublattice points. As the distance between two
fine lattice points increases, they have fewer sublattice points in common.

On the other hand, it is well known that a wavelet image normally exhibits strong intra-
subband correlation especially in low-frequency subbands, as the discrete wavelet trans-
form re-distributes the energy of the image into different subbands. One-dimensional
DWT passes the signal through a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter simultane-
ously, providing approximation coefficients (low-frequency subband) and detail coeffi-
cients (high-frequency subband), respectively. For two-dimensional DWT performed on
images, one level of transform generates four subbands. The subband with low-pass fil-
ters in both horizontal and vertical directions is termed as the “LL” subband. Similarly,
the subbands resulting from a high-pass filter in the horizontal direction and a low-pass
filter in the vertical direction, a low-pass filter in the horizontal direction and a high-pass
filter in the vertical direction, and high-pass filters in both directions are termed as the
“HL, “LH,’ and “HH” subbands, respectively. As an example, two-stage wavelet decompo-
sition of the image “Couple” is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that coefficients in subband
“LL” exhibit high correlation in both horizontal and vertical directions due to the fact that

“LL” is the low-pass filtered version of the original image in both directions. Likewise, the
coefficients in the “HL” and “LH” subbands are highly correlated either vertically or hori-
zontally. However, the coefficients in subband “HH” have less correlation in the subband
of high frequency in both directions.

In view of the concurrent correlations in the 3D-LVQ index assignment and wavelet
subbands, with properly constructed vectors based on the correlation of wavelet coef-
ficients, the neighboring wavelet vectors will most likely share some sublattice points,
which motivates us to develop a better side decoding approach by predicting lost
descriptions (sublattice points) using neighboring information. To exploit the directional
correlations in the wavelet subbands, we consider constructing a vector for the “LH”
subband with two horizontally neighboring coefficient, whereas for the “HL” subband, a
vector is constructed with two vertical neighboring coefficients. For simplicity, vectors
for the “LL” and “HH” subbands are also constructed horizontally.

3.2 Proposed 3D-LVQ side decoding with prediction

Consider a wavelet vector x which is mapped to (A4(x),A5(x),A3(x)) in the 3D-LVQ
coding, where i; (x) is assigned to kth description. We will first study the two-description-
based side decoding, that is, the reconstruction of the vector x if one description such
Xu EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:93 Page 8 of 14

as description k is lost (A, (x) is missing). As discussed above, there is strong intra- and
inter-correlation in the assignment of sublattice points for the 3D-LVQ mapping, while
neighboring wavelet vectors may most likely share most or all sublattice points. There-
fore, it is reasonable to predict the lost re (x) from those received sublattice points for the
vector x as well as from its neighboring vectors. A list of sublattice point candidates can
be formed for the estimation of 4, (x). Subsequently, we can reconstruct the vector x by
taking each sublattice point in the list as an estimate of the missing sublattice point for
decoding and finally averaging the decoded results.

As an example, we consider the vector x and its neighboring vector y labeled as
(A4(y),A5(y),A5(y)) with description 1 being lost. Then, we receive {A5(x),A3(x)} for
vector x and {A4(y),A3(y)} for vector y at the decoder side, while A(x) and A{(y) in
description 1 are missing. Based on the above discussion, the candidate list for estimating
the lost 44 (x) can be obtained as {A5(x), A5(x), A5(y), A5(y)}, in which each element may
be a good prediction. Note that these sublattice points in the list may be duplicate. We
can thereby use all the candidates in the list one by one as an estimate of the missing sub-
lattice point for decoding and then take the average as the reconstruction x. That can be
represented as:

K = (a1 (A5(x), A4(%), 43 (&))
+ a1 (A(x), AS (x), 45 (x))
+ a *(AS(y), A500), A500)
+ a *(AS(y),A5(x), 25 (x)))/4. (6)

If there are more neighboring vectors of x, their sublattice points can be included in the
candidate list. Note that there may be some invalid 3-tuple combinations with the predic-
tion scheme, which are not decodable by the inverse mapping function. In that case, those
sublattice points causing invalid combinations are removed from the candidate list. Then,
all the valid combinations based on the final candidate list are decoded and averaged as
the final reconstruction of x.

We now consider one-description-based side decoding where only one description is
received while the other two are missing. Assuming description 1 and description 2 are
lost, only the sublattice points {A3(x)} and {A5(y)} are received for the vector x and its
neighboring vector y, respectively. Similarly, we can also construct a candidate list of
{A3(x),A3(y)}. Instead of estimating the two missing sublattice points which are harder
or unreliable to be predicted based on one received sublattice point and its neighbor, we
simply use the sublattice points in the list as possible reconstructions for vector x fol-
lowed by an averaging that is k = (A5(x) + A5(y))/2. Like the two-description-based side
decoding, we also need to perform a validation for each candidate in the list by checking
whether the candidate point is the same as or immediately neighboring to the received
sublattice point {A5(x)}. Invalid sublattice points are removed from the list. Then, all the
valid sublattice points are averaged to obtain the final reconstruction x.

In the above, we show the way to obtain the reconstruction given one neighboring vec-
tor for vector x, which can be extended to the case of more neighboring vectors. Consider
a two-dimensional wavelet image, there are four directly neighboring vectors for a vector.
Denote by A (i, 7) the current vector to be decoded, while A(i— 1,7), A(i+1, 7) anda@j—1),
(i,j + 1) are the four adjacent vectors horizontally and vertically, respectively.
Xu EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:93 Page 9 of 14

For the band “LL,’ in view of both horizontal and vertical correlation, prediction for the
current vector A (i,j) can utilize the four adjacent vectors. All the received sublattice points
of vector A(i,j) and these four neighboring vectors are put into the candidate list with
possible duplicates. For the band “HL” exhibiting the vertical correlation, the two verti-
cally adjacent vectors A (i,j — 1) and A(i,j + 1) are employed for the prediction. Therefore,
the candidate list consists of received sublattice points for A(i,/), AG, j — 1), andA(@j+ 1).
For band “LH” showing the horizontal correlation, we use horizontally adjacent vectors
AG — 1,j) and A(i + 1,/) in the prediction. Consequently, the candidate list comprises the
received sublattice points for A (i,j), AG — 1,/), and A(i+ 1,7). For the band “HH,’ no pre-
diction is considered and the conventional MDLVQ decoding is performed, that is, the
received sublattice point or the average of two received sublattice points is used as the
reconstruction of the current vector for one-description-based or two-description-based
side decoding. Figure 4 illustrates the predictive side decoding using neighboring vectors
with respect to the different subbands.

4 Experimental methods

Five standard 512 x 512 images, “Lena,’ “Couple,” “Baboon,” “Aerial,” and “Goldhill,” were
tested in the experiment. The input image was applied with a discrete wavelet trans-
form (DWT), where four-stage decomposition with the 10/18 Daubechies wavelet was
employed. As mentioned before, to exploit the directional correlations in the wavelet sub-
bands, we constructed a 2 x 1 vector with two horizontally neighboring coefficients in the
“LH” subband or two vertically neighboring coefficients in the “HL” subband, while the
vectors in the “LL” and “HH” subbands could be formed horizontally or vertically (hori-
zontally in our experiments). Such a vector x is then quantized to a (fine) lattice point A(x),
which was mapped to three sublattice points (x) , A5(x), and 43(x) based on the pre-
designed index assignment. Lastly, adaptive three-order arithmetic coding was applied to
compress the three sequences of sublattice indexes. The three produced descriptions may
be transmitted in separate channels. At the receiver, the conventional decoding method
and the proposed predictive decoding method were used to reconstruct images based on

the received descriptions. Note that our focus is to test the effectiveness of the proposed
side decoding in terms of rate-distortion performance, as compared to the conventional
side decoding [51] as shown in (4) and (5). We implemented both the algorithms with the

sublattice index number N = 31.

5 Experimental results and discussion

Rate-distortion curves are plotted in Fig. 5 to compare the two decoding schemes in
decoding all the five testing images. It can be seen that our proposed predictive scheme
consistently outperforms the conventional method in both one-description-based and
two-description-based side decoding, where up to 1.68 dB (at 0.531 bpp for “Goldhill”)

and 1.64 dB (at 0.531 bpp for “Goldhill”) gains are obtained in the cases of 2-description
side decoding and 1-description side decoding, respectively. Reconstructed images for
“Lena” in the case of losses of one and two descriptions are shown in Fig. 6 for a sub-
jective visual comparison. In the figure, the proposed scheme can achieve 1.37 dB gain
at 0.537 bpp in the 2-description side decoding and 1.25 dB gain at 1.012 bpp in the
1-description side decoding over the conventional method for “Lena,’ respectively. The
coding gain tends to become more significant at lower bit rates where the side distor-
tion is normally larger, as expected. With a higher coding bit rate, the conventional side
decoding may also reconstruct a vector fairly well even with one or two received sublat-
tice points due to a finer quantization in that case, leaving less room of improvement for

the predictive side decoding.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we consider the design of human-centered image coding scheme that can
adapt to people’s varying watching situations and consider people’s demand for real-time

image display. Specifically, a novel predictive side decoding scheme for 3D-LVQ-based
image coding has been proposed. In view of the strong intra- and inter-correlation in the
index assignment of 3D-LVQ mapping as well as the intra-subband correlation exhib-
ited in the low-frequency wavelet subbands, we have developed an effective prediction
approach for lost descriptions (sublattice points) to enhance side decoding performance.
The prediction scheme adapts to the different subbands with varying intra-subband cor-
relation characteristics. Experimental results have substantiated the effectiveness of the
proposed predictive side coding in reducing side distortions significantly for both two-
description-based and one-description-based cases. As compared to the conventional
side decoding method, the proposed decoding scheme has shown up to 1.68 dB and
1.64 dB performance gains in the cases of 2-description side decoding and 1-description

side decoding, respectively, in our experiments.
