label correction of Mindboggle-101
atlas for MNI-ICBM152 template

; AnaL. Manera@®*?, Mahsa Dadar?, Vladimir Fonov? & D. Louis Collins?™

' Accurate anatomical atlases are recognized as important tools in brain-imaging research. They are
: widely used to estimate disease-specific changes and therefore, are of great relevance in extracting

regional information on volumetric variations in clinical cohorts in comparison to healthy populations.

: The use of high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging and the improvement in data

preprocessing methods have enabled the study of structural volume changes on a wide range of

: disorders, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases where different brain morphometry analyses are

being broadly used in an effort to improve diagnostic biomarkers. In the present dataset, we introduce

: the Cerebrum Atlas (CerebrA) along with the MNI-ICBM2009c average template. MNI-ICBM2009c is
> the most recent version of the MNI-ICBM152 brain average, providing a higher level of anatomical

details. Cerebra is based on an accurate non-linear registration of cortical and subcortical labelling from
Mindboggle 101 to the symmetric MNI-ICBM2009c atlas, followed by manual editing.

Background & Summary
Brain atlases are widely recognized as important tools in research for the analysis of neuroimages. High spa-

: tial resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and improved data preprocessing have enabled the study of

structural volume changes in a wide range of disorders. Anatomical atlases are central to the understanding of

: the brain anatomy and are the best resources to bring prior knowledge about anatomy into any computer vision

methodology involved in various types of brain imaging analyses. Anatomical atlases can also be used to inves-

: tigate potential disease-specific changes that occur in clinical cohorts compared with healthy populations, by
: providing information on region locations for various regions of interest. Analysis of {MRI data also routinely
: involves registration to a template and extraction of the average signal within various regions of interest within
: the corresponding anatomical atlases’.

The MNI-ICBM152 brain template’, from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) is a crucial tool in neu-

: roimage analysis. This multi-contrast atlas including Tlw, T2w and PDw contrasts, was built recruiting brain

scans from 152 young adults at 1.5 T. The 2009 edition uses group-wise non-linear registration for better align-

: ment of cortical structures between subjects. The MNI-ICBM152 non-linear model has many advantages. It was

created from a large number of subjects; hence it represents the average anatomy of the population and is not

: biased unlike single-subject models. In addition, the left-right symmetric version enables interpretation of asym-
> metries that might be found in an analysis.

Mindboggle-101 is the largest, publicly available set of manually labelled human brain images created from 101

: human scans, labelled according to a surface-based cortical labelling protocol (DKT- Desikan-Killiany-Tourville
: labelling protocol)**. For the creation of the Mindboggle-101 dataset, developed to serve as brain atlas for use in
: labelling other brains, 101 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRI images were selected and segmented based on a mod-
: ification of the DKT cortical parcellation atlas*. These labels were then manually edited in agreement with the

DKT protocol. Labelling was performed on the surface, yet, topographical landmarks visible in the folded surface

: were used to infer label boundaries. In addition, Mindboggle used non-cortical labels that were converted from
: Neuromorphometrics BrainCOLOR subcortex labels’.

The Cerebrum Atlas (CerebrA) includes co-registration of the Mindboggle atlas* to the symmetric version of
MNI-ICBM 2009c’ average template (at a resolution of 1 x 1 x 1 mm?) in addition to manual editing of cortical

and subcortical labels. In the present dataset, we introduce an accurate non-linear registration of cortical and
subcortical labelling from Mindboggle 101 to the symmetric MNI-ICBM2009c atlas followed by manual editing.

Methods
MNI-ICBM152 template. This section summarizes the details on generation of the nonlinear MNI-
ICBM2009c average template. Further methodological details can be found in the original paper by Fonov et al.’.
Within the ICBM project, MRI data from 152 young normal adults (18.5-43.5 years) were acquired on a Philips
1.5 T Gyroscan (Best, Netherlands) scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The Tlw data were acquired
with a spoiled gradient echo sequence (sagittal acquisition, 140 contiguous 1 mm thick slices, TR= 18 ms,
TE=10ms, flip angle 30°, rectangular FOV of 256mm SI and 204mm AP). The Ethics Committee of the
Montreal Neurological Institute approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all participants’.
The following preprocessing steps were applied to all MRI scans prior to building the atlas: (1) N3
non-uniformity correction’; (2) linear normalization of each scan’s intensity to the range [0-100] by a single linear
histogram scaling®; (3) automatic linear (nine parameters) registration to the ICBM 152 stereotaxic space’; and
(4) brain mask creation®. Only the voxels within the brain volume after linear mapping into stereotaxic space were
used for the nonlinear registration procedure described. The template described is generated through a hierarchi-
cal nonlinear registration procedure, with diminishing step sizes in each iteration until convergence and relies on
the nonlinear registration using Automatic Nonlinear Image Matching and Anatomical Labelling (ANIMAL)’.
The nonlinear versions of MNI-ICBM2009 (http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?p=904) have many advantages over widely
used previous versions (i.e. MNI-ICBM non-linear 6" generation; http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?p=858, https://fsl.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/ Atlases). Besides, anatomical variability still remains after linear transformation to ster-
eotaxic space, therefore sulci and gyri remain blurred in previous versions’” (Fig. 1).

Mindboggle-101. This section summarizes the generation of the original Mindboggle-101 atlas and addi-
tional methodological details can be found in the original paper by Klein and Tourville 2012’. The authors started
with publicly accessible T1-w MRI scans selected from 101 healthy participants. Scanner acquisition and demo-
graphic information can be found in Klein 2012? and are also available on the http://mindboggle.info/data web-
site. The data sets that comprise the Mindboggle-101 include the 20 test-retest subjects from the “Open Access
Series of Imaging Studies” data'’, the 21 test-retest subjects from the “Multi-Modal ReproducibilityResource””’,
with two additional subjects run under the same protocol in 3T and 7 T scanners, 20 subjects from the “Nathan
Kline Institute Test-Retest” set, 22 subjects from the “Nathan Kline Institute/Rockland Sample’, the 12 “Human
Language Network” subjects’, the Colin Holmes 27 template’, two identical twins, and one brain imaging
colleague.

T1-w MRI volumes were preprocessed and segmented and then, cortical surfaces were generated using
FreeSurfer’s standard recon-all image processing pipeline’»’*. FreeSurfer then automatically labelled the cortical
surface using its DKT cortical parcellation atlas*’’. Vertices along the cortical surface are assigned a given label
based on local surface curvature and average convexity, prior label probabilities, and neighbouring vertex labels.
FreeSurfer automatically labelled the cortical surface using its DKT cortical parcellation atlas for 54 of the brains
in the Mindboggle-101 data set. The region definitions of the labelling protocol represented by the DKT atlas are
described by Desikan et al.*. These labels were then manually edited in agreement with the DKT protocol with
31 cortical regions per hemisphere as described by Klein and Tourville’. Then, the first 40 brains that labelled
were selected to train a new FreeSurfer cortical parcellation atlas representing the DKT protocol (see http://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/GcaFormat; Segonne et al.'’; Desikan et al.* for details regarding
the algorithm that generates the atlas and how it is implemented). The resulting atlas was named “DKT40 clas-
sifier atlas” which then automatically generated the initial set of cortical labels for the remaining 47 brains in the
data. Finally, Mindboggle data includes non-cortical labels that were converted from the Neuromorphometrics
BrainCOLOR subcortex labels (i.e., http://Neuromorphometrics.com/). Details on the original labels included in
Mindboggle-101 can be found in https://mindboggle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labels.html. OASIS-30_Atropos_
template and OASIS-TRT-20_jointfusion_DKT31_CMA_labels_in_OASIS-30_v2 were the template and atlas files
that were used for registration to the MNI-ICBM2009 template and manual correction.

Atlas registration and manual label editing. The Mindboggle-101 average template was first linearly
and then non-linearly registered to the symmetric version of MNI-ICBM (MNI-ICBM2009c) template. In both
registrations, the Mindboggle-101 template was used as the source image, and the MNI-ICBM2009c template
was used as the target image. The linear registration was performed with 9 parameters (-Isq9, 3 for translation,
3 for rotation, and 3 for scaling), using bestlinreg_s2 pipeline from the MINCTools”®. The resulting image was
then nonlinearly registered to MNI-ICBM2009c template using the ANTs diffeomorphic registration pipeline”,
providing both source and target masks. Using the obtained nonlinear transformation, the Mindboggle-101 atlas
labels were also resampled and registered to MNI-ICBM2009c template, using the label resampling option from
itk_resample tool (i-e.,-label, applying a nearest neighbor interpolator for discrete labels). The quality of the reg-
istration was visually assessed by overlaying the registered Mindboggle-101 and MNI-ICBM2009c templates as
well as the registered Mindboggle-101 atlas to ensure accurate transformation of the labels to the MNI-ICBM2009
template. Any remaining inaccuracies were manually corrected on the right hemisphere using the interactive
software package Display, part of the MINC Tool Kit, developed at the McConnell Brain Imaging Center of the
Montreal Neurological Institute (https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/software/visualization/display, https://github.com/
BIC-MNI). The program allows simultaneous viewing and segmentation in the coronal, sagittal and axial planes,
as well as intensity thresholding, label filling, dilation, and erosion. The corrections were performed by A.M., a
neurologist with 10 years of experience in reading and assessment of MRIs. Prior to performing these corrections,
A.M. received additional training on performing manual segmentations using Display by an anatomist expert
both in using Display and MRI segmentation. These corrections mainly involved improvements of boundaries
between neighboring regions, addition of missing voxels in some structures (detailed in Table 1) and improving
the continuity of voxels within each region. Afterwards, labels were flipped onto the left hemisphere and then
visual inspection on each structure was performed. In detail, thickness and boundaries of all 51 cortical and sub-
cortical labels from each hemisphere were improved using intensity thresholds with manual painting using MNI
Display. Details on the significant edits that were made for particular structures are provided in Table 1.

Warped CerebrA atlas (a,b) and Mindboggle-101 atlas (c,d) overlaid on the ICBM152 non-linear 2009
symmetric average MRI template. Note the improved label alignment on the cortical structures.

Comparison between atlases. Dice Kappa similarity index was used to assess the degree of agreement
between the CerebrA labels and the original Mindboggle-101 labels, after registration to the MNI-ICBM2009
template. The label agreement before and after manual correction is included to demonstrate the improvement
achieved by manual correction. Dice Kappa measures the proportion of the number of voxels that are common
between the two masks, over the total number of voxels within the masks, and is defined as:

«20%
y+ V;

where k denotes the Dice Kappa coefficient, and V, and V, denote the two volumes under comparison. A Dice
Kappa of 1 implies perfect agreement, whereas a Dice Kappa of 0 implies no overlap between the two masks.

When comparing CerebrA to original labels from Mindboggle-101 (Fig. 2) registered to ICBM152, the average
Dice Kappa value was k = 0.73 £0.18 (Table 1). The structures with relatively lower Dice Kappa (k < 0.6) corre-
sponded to the structures that needed the most correction such as the optic chiasm, inferior lateral ventricles,
fourth ventricle and cerebellar vermis. The optic chiasm label was barely found in the original Mindboggle-101
registered to ICBM152 and most of it was misaligned with regards to the actual structure. To ensure that this inac-
curacy was not caused by the nonlinear registration process, we further inspected the original Mindboggle-101
template and label atlas and found similar issues. For CerebrA, the optic chiasm label was redefined trying to
achieve continuity amongst optic chiasma itself and optic tracts (Fig. 3, panel a). Then, the inferior lateral ventricles
and fourth ventricle boundaries were improved using a threshold to differentiate CSF from parenchyma (Fig. 3,
panels b and c). And finally, cerebellar vermis labels were redefined for right and left side (Fig. 3, panels d-f).

Another significant change in CerebrA from the original warped labels was the brainstem label definition. The
brainstem area was manually redefined for the right side and then flipped in the same procedure as all the labels
considering the symmetrical feature of the ICBM152 2009c’ template. In addition, boundaries between brainstem
and fourth ventricle were carefully defined using the CSF intensity threshold, cerebellar white matter labels within
the brainstem area were removed and rostral brainstem delimitation was improved (Fig. 4).

Inter-rater and intra-rater variability assessments. To assess intra-rater variability, the rater repeated
the process of manual correction for 10 randomly selected regions, and the results were compared against the
previously corrected masks. The mean Dice-Kappa values between the two masks were 0.88 + 0.03. To assess
inter-rater variability, the same 10 selected regions were rated a second time by another independent rater and
these results were also compared against the previously corrected masks, yielding a mean inter-rater Dice-Kappa
of 0.83 + 0.05.

Volumes of cortical and subcortical structures. Region volumes were calculated for all cortical and
subcortical structures before and after performing the manual correction by summing up the number of voxels
within each label (in CCs). These volumes were then log-transformed to achieve normal distribution to enable

comparisons between the two sets of volumes. Figure 5a shows the correlation plot between the log-transformed
CerebrA and Mindboggle volumes. Although the volumes were strongly and significantly correlated (R= 0.9657,
P value < 0.001), overall volumes estimated with CerebrA were larger than those estimated with Mindboggle-101
(Fig. 5a). The volumes estimated per structure using Mindboggle and CerebrA segmentation are listed in Table 2.

Overlap with CSF. Using the CSF mask of the MNI-ICBM152 template, the number of voxels within each
label that overlapped with the CSF was calculated to assess which template had a lower overlap with CSE. The four
ventricular regions (i.e. lateral ventricles, inferior lateral ventricles, 3! and 4" ventricles) were excluded from this
analysis. Figure 5b shows the proportion of overlap of each of the labels with the CSF for each atlas; i.e. the num-
ber of voxels in the specific mask overlapping with the CSF mask divided by the total number of voxels inside the
specific mask. Overall, Mindboggle-101 showed greater overlap of cortical and subcortical structures with CSF
(Fig. 5b). Cerebellar vermal lobule regions (630 and 631) from Mindboggle-101 had the highest degree of overlap
(20%) with the CSF, due to a combination of misalignment and over-segmentation errors (see Fig. 2c).

Usage Notes

Atlases are sometimes used to compare individual subjects. Such comparisons, made based on average templates
and corresponding atlases, are by nature prone to errors caused by registration of a subject's brain to the template.
Such errors are dependent on the individual scans, and are generally greater in presence of pathologies such as
tumors, lesions, severe atrophy, etc.'*. Therefore, these types of errors might introduce systematic biases in the
findings, and great care should be taken to assess registration accuracy when performing such analyses.

Code availability

The scripts used to perform both the linear and nonlinear registrations (including the ANTs code with all the
selected registration parameters), the obtained transformations that were used to register the DKT atlas to the
MNI-ICBM2009c template, the code for resampling the labels based on these transformations, as well as the
registered DKT atlas in the MNI space, after applying the transformations are available at https://gin.g-node.org/
anamanera/CerebrA/src/master/.
