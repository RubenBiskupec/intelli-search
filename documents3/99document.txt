metadata management applied to digital
reconstructions of neuronal morphology

Kayvan Bijari, Masood A. Akram and Giorgio A. Ascoli

Abstract

Research advancements in neuroscience entail the production of a substantial amount of data requiring interpreta-
tion, analysis, and integration. The complexity and diversity of neuroscience data necessitate the development of
specialized databases and associated standards and protocols. NeuroMorpho.Org is an online repository of over one
hundred thousand digitally reconstructed neurons and glia shared by hundreds of laboratories worldwide. Every
entry of this public resource is associated with essential metadata describing animal species, anatomical region, cell
type, experimental condition, and additional information relevant to contextualize the morphological content. Until
recently, the lack of a user-friendly, structured metadata annotation system relying on standardized terminologies
constituted a major hindrance in this effort, limiting the data release pace. Over the past 2 years, we have transitioned
the original soreadsheet-based metadata annotation system of NeuroMorpho.Org to a custom-developed, robust,
web-based framework for extracting, structuring, and managing neuroscience information. Here we release the
metadata portal publicly and explain its functionality to enable usage by data contributors. This framework facilitates
metadata annotation, improves terminology management, and accelerates data sharing. Moreover, its open-source
development provides the opportunity of adapting and extending the code base to other related research projects
with similar requirements. This metadata portal is a beneficial web companion to NeuroMorpho.Org which saves time,
reduces errors, and aims to minimize the barrier for direct knowledge sharing by domain experts. The underlying
framework can be progressively augmented with the integration of increasingly autonomous machine intelligence

components.

1 Introduction

Neuroscience is continuously producing an immense
amount of complex and highly heterogeneous data typi-
cally associated with peer-reviewed publications. When
building data-driven models of brain function, computa-
tional neuroscientists must engage in the laborious task
of reviewing, annotating, and deriving many parameters
required for numerical simulations. More generally, the

process of curation consists of extracting, maintain-
ing, and adding value to digital information from the
literature and underlying datasets [6]. Mature reference
management tools exist to aid general-purpose bibliog-
raphy organization and content annotation, including
Zotero [35], Mendeley [40], and EndNote [1]. Moreo-
ver, community-sourced terminologies [11, 14, 21, 38]
and domain-specific markup languages [16, 24, 18] pro-
vide human-interpretable controlled vocabularies and
machine-readable file formats, respectively. Efforts are
also underway to generate standardized data models
[15, 39, 36] and to formalize related concepts into robust
ontologies [20, 23, 25]. As a result, full-text information

retrieval systems are becoming indispensable research
aids [13, 22, 28, 29].

Despite promising progress, neuroscience and related
fields lacked until recently a user-friendly tool to annotate
a dataset or journal article across a customizable variety
of fields with a set of controlled vocabularies. At the same
time, a systematic and well-documented extraction pro-
cess is essential to keep the curated metadata updated
over time and portable between different projects [32].
Perhaps the sole example of an open-source, web-based
framework for the acquisition, storage, search, and reuse
of scientific metadata is the CEDAR workbench [17]. On
the one hand, the entirety of neuroscience is too broad
and diverse to fully benefit from an all-encompassing
metadata annotation tool. On the other, the most useful
motivating applications are typically task specific and,
consequently, difficult to compare with other developed
tools. Meanwhile, several fundamental metadata dimen-
sions, including details about the animal subject, the
location within the nervous system, and the experimental
condition, are largely common to even considerably dis-
tinct subfields of neuroscience. One possible approach is
therefore to design a practical solution to a specific prob-
lem of interest while adhering to a strictly open-source
implementation that may foster broad adoption and cus-
tom adaptation throughout the neuroscience community.

Here, we introduce a resource developed to promote
and facilitate data sharing and metadata annotation for
NeuroMorpho.Org, a repository providing unrestricted
access to digital reconstructions of neuronal and glial
morphology [2, 3]. The acquisition and release of mor-
phological tracings begin with the continuous identifica-
tion of newly published scientific reports describing data
of interest [19, 26]. To annotate the reconstructions with
proper metadata, the repository administrators have also
been inviting data contributors to provide suitable infor-
mation through a semi-structured Excel spreadsheet
[33]. While the ecosystem of neuronal reconstructions
has coalesced around a simple data standard for over two
decades [30], selection and interpretation of metadata
concepts remain highly variable and inconsistent. Thus,
for every new dataset, a team of trained curators must
validate or reconcile the author-provided information,
complemented as needed by the associated publication,
with the metadata schema and preferred nomenclature
of the database. Many data releases also introduce new
metadata concepts, which need to be integrated into the
existing ontology and require updating relevant data-
base hierarchies with appropriate terms. Although the
described process is time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and error-prone, metadata annotation is instrumental
to enable NeuroMorpho.Org semantic queries [34] and

machine accessibility through Application Programming
Interfaces [4].

This article presents the NeuroMorpho.Org meta-
data portal, a novel, open-source, web-based tool for
the efficient annotation and collaborative management
of data descriptors for digital reconstructions of neu-
ronal and glial morphology. The main goal of this effort
is the gradual automation of the metadata extraction
process to reduce the burden on database curators, thus
streamlining the data release workflow for the benefit
of the entire research community. A related motivation
is to bring domain expertise closer to the crucial task
of metadata curation by empowering data contributors
with direct dataset annotation through a graphical user
interface. The longer-term vision is to lay the training
data foundation for augmenting neuro-curation with
semi-autonomous machine learning components such
as recommendation systems or natural language process-
ing tools [8, 9, 12]. With this report, we freely release the
documented code base to date and welcome modifica-
tions or improvements by other developers to tailor the
metadata management platform for different neurosci-
ence initiatives.

2 Methods

The metadata portal is designed to match the NeuroMor-
pho.Org metadata structure. Here first we summarize the
organization of reconstruction metadata in this resource
and then explain how the architectural design of the por-
tal optimally serves the needs of the project.

2.1 Organization of NeuroMorpho.Org metadata
NeuroMorpho.Org stores over 120,000 digital recon-
structions of neuronal and glial morphology from nearly
650 independent laboratories and more than 1000 peer-
reviewed articles. Each reconstruction is associated with
detailed metadata across 25 dimensions thematically
grouped into five different categories, namely animal,
anatomy, completeness, experiment, and source [33].

The animal category specifies the subject of the study:
species, strain, sex, weight, development stage, and age.

The anatomy category designates the brain region
and cell type. Each of these two dimensions is hierar-
chically divided into three levels, from generic to spe-
cific: for instance, hippocampus/CA1/pyramidal layer
and interneuron/basket cell/parvalbumin-expressing.
Three considerations are especially important in this
regard: first, additional information can be added in
multiple entries at the third level. In the above exam-
ple, the brain region could be further annotated as left
and dorsal; and the cell type as fast-spiking and radi-
ally oriented. Second, the anatomical hierarchies are
loosely rather than strictly organized since the specific
Bijari et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:2

details reported in (and relevant for) different stud-
ies vary considerably. If another paper describes the
brain region of its dataset simply as dorsal hippocam-
pus (without mentioning sub-area and layer), the con-
cept “dorsal” would shift up to the second level. Third,
both brain regions and cell types depend dramatically
on the animal species, and most substantially diverge at
the vertebrate vs. invertebrate taxa. Whenever possible,
NeuroMorpho.Org follows the BrainInfo classification
and NeuroNames terminology for vertebrates [10], and
Virtual Fly Brain for invertebrates [31].

The completeness category provides details on the
relative physical integrity of the reconstruction (account-
ing for tissue sectioning, partial staining, limited field of
view, etc.), the structural domains included in the tracing
(soma, axons, dendrites, undifferentiated neurites or glial
processes), and the morphological attributes included
or excluded from the measurement (most importantly,
diameter and the depth coordinate).

The experiment category consists of methodological
information describing the preparation protocol (e.g.
in vivo, slice or culture), condition (control vs. lesioned,
treated or transgenic), visualization label or stain, thick-
ness and orientation of slicing or optical sections, objec-
tive type and magnification, tissue shrinkage and eventual
corrections, and the tracing software.

The fifth category, source, provides details on the
contributing laboratory, the reference publication, the

Page 3 of 12

original digital file formats, and the dates of receipt and
release.

If any metadata dimension is not returned by the
author or mentioned in the publication, the correspond-
ing entry is marked as “Not reported” in the repository.

Here we refer to ‘dataset’ as a collection of reconstruc-
tions associated with a single peer-reviewed publica-
tion. Many datasets are naturally divided into distinct
metadata groups, either as a focus of the study (e.g. con-
trol vs. experimental condition) or because of cell-level
specification of a particular variable (often animal sex
or age). Typically, almost all metadata features are iden-
tical across the entire dataset except for specific details
varying between groups. NeuroMorpho.Org preserves
the same annotation organization at the levels of data-
set, groups, and individual cells (Fig. 1). This intuitive yet
compact structure conveniently allows both comparative
statistical analyses and machine-readable accessibility via
APIs.

2.2 Design and implementation of the metadata portal

To ensure flexibility, scalability, portability, and efficiency,
the metadata portal is designed based on the model-
view-controller (MVC) software architecture [7]. This
modular approach separates the application into three
essentially independent components. The model repre-
sents the metadata structure and reflects the constraints,
relations, and formats stored in the database through an

object-relational mapper (ORM). The view defines the
display presented to the operator through the graphical
user interface (GUI). The controller mediates the requests
of the user, interacts with the model, and generates an
appropriate response for the view (Fig. 2). While anchor-
ing the architectural foundation of the metadata portal
onto a safe and trusted design pattern, the novelty of
this development mostly lies in its goal and features that
assist users in the metadata curation process.

The entire implementation abides by open-source
principles and relies solely on open-source resources.

The relational models of the portal in addition to the data
are maintained in PostgreSQL, a fast, secure, and exten-
sible relational database management system. The user
interface is formulated by HTML, JavaScript, and Boot-
strap, a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) framework directed
at responsive front-end web development. The control
back-end is programmed in Django, a Python-based
framework emphasizing pluggable and reusable ele-
ments, to regulate the interactions between database and
users. Such modular yet integrated web-based framework
offers rapid, cost-effective, and customizable application

development. The resulting application is effortlessly
accessible anytime across different platforms, enhancing
interoperability and enabling different classes of users
(authors, admins, and curators) to use the system inde-
pendently while maintaining their work in the database.
The metadata portal encompasses most of the essen-
tial components to fulfill the curation needs of Neuro-
Morpho.Org. At the same time, it is also continuously
evolving as new operational capabilities are prioritized.
Recently developed features include: (i) the API (http://
cng-nmo-meta.orc.gmu.edu/api/) enabling data inter-
action between the metadata portal and NeuroMorpho.
Org; (ii) keyword search (http://cng-nmo-meta.orc.gmu.
edu/search/), a user-friendly search engine allowing users
to look for available terms in the database and their hier-
archy; and (iii) bulk-modification feature, providing the
ability to modify a large portion of terms within datasets.
The user interface of metadata portal offers seam-
less access to different parts and features of the system.
The main page (http://cng-nmo-meta.orc.gmu.edu/)
lists all active datasets. Each dataset is annotated with
the name of the data contributor, publication identifiers
(PMID and URL), and information regarding grant sup-
port. Metadata groups and their corresponding labels can
be entered manually or are automatically created upon
uploading grouped reconstruction files. Next, users select

the actual entries for every metadata dimension, and
the entire information remains accessible and editable
through the web form. A detailed step-by-step metadata
annotation protocol follows at the end of the Results.

3 Results

We deployed the metadata portal for internal usage in
the NeuroMorpho.Org curation team in spring 2018
after release v.7.4 of the database, which contained
86,893 reconstructions. The most recent release at the
time of this writing (fall 2019), v.7.9, contains 121,578
reconstructions. Thus, we completed five full releases
and annotated nearly 35,000 new reconstructions using
the novel system described in this article. Moreover,
we analyzed the records regarding metadata entry over
four releases prior to deployment of the current system,
namely, from right after release v7.0 (fall 2016), which
contained 50,356 reconstructions. In the next section,
we describe the positive impact on the project of switch-
ing from offline spreadsheet annotation to the web-based
metadata portal.

as several dimensions (e.g. animal weight and age)
require more than one field (e.g. a numerical value and
a unit scale). If treated as free text entry, many terms can
be written in multiple equivalent variants, as in ‘mouse,
‘Mouse, ‘mice, ‘mus musculus’ as well as being prone to
semantically deviant typos (‘moose’). When consider-
ing the combination of all metadata fields, even in the
absence of errors, the exact same information can be
annotated in more than 10,000 distinct ways. Such an
extreme case of combinatorial synonymy raises seri-
ous database management issues, in addition to slowing
down search queries and requiring substantially inflated
curation efforts. While the ‘mouse’ example may appear
innocuous, even professional annotators can rapidly
slide outside their zone of comfort when trying to distin-
guish between terminological equivalence and subtle but
important differences in a genetic manipulation, stain-
ing process or electrophysiological firing pattern. The
metadata portal offers a solution based on a corpus of
controlled vocabularies consisting of public NeuroMor-
pho.Org content practically organized in user-friendly

Page 6 of 12

dropdown menus with autocomplete functionality and
‘similar hits’ suggestions. Moreover, the web form is
endowed with hierarchical logic so that, for example, rat
strains are not presented if mouse is selected as species.

Another major aspect of metadata annotation is the
ongoing necessity to add new terms to describe previ-
ously unencountered entries. While certain dimensions,
such as developmental stage, sex, objective type, and
physical integrity, remain essentially unaltered over time,
others, including brain regions, cell types, and experi-
mental conditions, grow continuously at rates of approxi-
mately 5% (amounting to hundreds of new entries)
per database release (Table 1). The web-based system
facilitates the management of new concepts by enabling
submission of free-text entries when needed; these are
logged in real time into the database, allowing secondary
review and provenance tracking.

Note that the growth of the data has maintained
an approximately constant pace throughout the ana-
lyzed period, with similar amounts of metadata anno-
tations considered before and after the introduction
of the portal. Based on our lab records and analytics
reports, the initial manual annotation of datasets in the
last four releases (v.7.1—4) prior to deploying the meta-
data portal took an average of 1 h and 40 min per article
(100+10 min, mean +standard deviation; N= 308 arti-
cles). The mean time required for the same operation in
the five subsequent releases following the introduction
of the portal (v. 7.5-9) dropped to 55+5 min per article
(N= 166), corresponding to a net saving of 45 min in the
first step of metadata curation for each dataset. Moreo-
ver, all new terms need to be identified both to ensure
appropriate database updating and synchronization, and
to inform users upon release. This operation used to be
carried out manually by visually inspecting each form,
which normally required 141 h of labor per release.
The web-based portal automatically logs and reports all
new terms, thus completely eliminating the need for this
effort.

After the first annotation phase, metadata curation
requires a second step of quality check after the preview
release on the password-protected server and correspond-
ing review by data contributors and database curators
prior to public release. In most cases, this second phase
entails at least some corrections and adjustments. When
metadata was entered manually through a regular spread-
sheet form (through v.7.4), most errors requiring correc-
tions consisted of spelling mistakes (‘neocrotex’ instead
of ‘neocortex’) or use of non-preferred terms (‘isocortex’
or ‘ctx’). A less common type of corrections involved con-
ventional order of entries, as in “neocortex > medial pre-
frontal > right” vs. “neocortex > right > medial prefrontal”
Altogether, these issues required 100+15 corrections

per release in the old system. Use of controlled vocabu-
laries, dropdown menus, smart filters, and autocomplete
functionality dramatically reduced these instances to as
few as 1545 per release. Corrections are especially tax-
ing on data curators and database administrators, because
mistaken ‘new’ entries need to be removed post-inges-
tion to avoid inconsistencies, indices and caches cleared,
and synonyms properly linked for searches to work as
intended. The drastic reduction in the number of required
corrections saved about 18 h of labor per release, from
22 +3 prior to portal adoption to 4+ 1 afterwards.

When considering all sources of time saving (anno-
tation, new term extraction, and corrections), the
introduction of the web portal reduced the metadata
annotation effort from 115.6+ 35.4 to 48.3 + 19.5 person-
hour/release, a 58% effort reduction (Fig. 3).

3.2 Usage protocol

In addition to the many advantages of the metadata
portal described above, the web-based implementation
naturally enables its direct usage by the authors of the
articles described the original datasets, namely the data
contributors. Considering the greatly improved per-
formance of metadata annotation, with this article we
invite all researchers depositing their neuronal and glial

 

Fig.6 Metadata form to annotate the details of the reconstruction within each experimental group

 

tracings into NeuroMorpho.Org to utilize the portal for
annotating their submission. In this section, we overview
the functionality, features and usage of the system http://
cng-nmo-meta.orc.gmu.edu/.

In order to limit the server susceptibility to automated
malicious activities, users must log in via username
(nmo-author) and password (neuromorpho) or using
a Google account. Using the latter approach, the user’s
entry remains private (only visible to the contributor and
the administrators, but not to other users) until approved
for public release by the NeuroMorpho.Org curators.
Upon entering the portal (Fig. 4), users can create a data-
set by clicking on the ‘New!’ button in the main view.

The newly opened window prompts the insertion of
information related to the reference publication such
as PMID, authorship, and grant support. Next, click-

4 Conclusion

Continuous growth of neuroscience knowledge requires
a parallel maturation of informatics resources to anno-
tate data for future re-use and interpretation. This report
introduced a newly developed metadata portal that lev-
erages web-based technologies to facilitate effective
curation of digital reconstructions of neuronal and glial
morphologies. All components of this framework are
open-source and can thus be adopted for or adapted to
the needs of other related projects. Moreover, the meta-
data portal is ready to be integrated with artificial intel-
ligence modules such as natural language processing
Bijari et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:2

or smart recommendation systems to further expedite
and improve the critical bottleneck of database cura-
tion. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been
successfully deployed for metadata extraction [27]. In
particular, text mining tools, such as named entity rec-
ognition, can learn, identify, and label crucial elements
of neuroscience documents like neuron names, brain
regions, and experimental conditions [5, 37] . Hence, our
future aim will be, first, to train and validate a model on
the growing set of curated articles in the NeuroMorpho.
Org literature database, as well as on the named enti-
ties therein; and then to deploy it on the metadata portal
in order to facilitate assisted keyword extraction. To be
clear, we consider it unrealistic to expect full automation
of all metadata extraction tasks in the near future, as too
many decisions involve domain-specific expertise and
often ad-hoc conventions. Nevertheless, the prospect
of a hybrid human-computer interface ergonomically
optimized to maximize the breadth, depth, and accu-
racy of annotation while minimizing time and labor is in
our view well within reach. As a first step in that direc-
tion, the systematic coding of the prior entirely manual
spreadsheet annotation process of NeuroMorpho.Org
metadata within a web-form interfaced to a back-end
database has already substantially reduced the ongoing
curation effort. We are now releasing this system pub-
licly to allow willing data contributors to enter the details
of their datasets directly at the time of data submission.
While the design of the portal still allows and encourages
an iterative process of collaborative review to reduce the
risk of ambiguity and inconsistencies, we hope that ena-
bling metadata annotation by the “ultimate experts” who
produced the data will bring us closer to a robust, distrib-
uted, and dynamic community-based resource.
