Introduction
Network theory is an important tool for describing and analysing complex systems which
are represented as mathematical graphs. It has many applications in social, biological,
physical, information and engineering sciences (Fortunato 2010; Newman 2003; Gosak et
al. 2017; Seminar 2019; Pavlopoulos et al. 2011; Djemili et al. 2017). For example, it has
been used to capture interesting properties of many real networks, e.g. having a heavy-
tailed degree distribution, having the small-world property, the existence of nodes playing
central roles and/or the existence of modular structures (Newman 2003).

Recently, an increasing body of work investigates networks with multiple types of links,
as well as the so-called “networks of networks”. Variants of such systems have been exam-
ined decades ago in disciplines such as sociology and engineering, but only recently have

they been unified, along with other nomenclature, within the framework of multilayer
networks defined by Kivela et al. (2014).

In parallel many aspects of real systems are increasingly and routinely sensed, measured
and described, resulting in many private, but also open data sets. By private data we mean
data collected internally in a company or institution. Open data refers to the idea that
some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish at will, without
restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.

In many domains publicly available repositories of open data sets constitute a great
opportunity for domain experts to contextualise their privately generated data compared
to publicly available data in their domain.

In this paper we propose a methodology for multilayer network analysis in order to pro-
vide domain experts with measures and methods to understand, evaluate and complete
their private data by comparing and/or combining them with open data when both are
modelled as multilayer networks.

Main contributions of this paper are:

1. We propose a new formalism for multilayer network that allows to carry out fine
analysis by considering two levels: the intra-layer level and the inter-layer one. We
show examples of how we can extend the definition of global and local measures as
density and centralities to the inter-layer level and the whole network.

2. We define the private multilayer network: the induced graph elaborated from the
private data is extracted in order to be analysed and compared to the whole
network.

3. We define the private egocentric network: the notion of egocentric network which
is defined around a given ego node (Marsden 2002; Djemili et al. 2017) is extended
to an egocentric network around private multilayer network.The private egocentric
network can be used to evaluate the connectivity strength between the different
layers of private data in comparison to the whole network. The private egocentric
network can also help to focus the study of the private network in the space of its
neighbours across the layers especially in the context of very large-scale open
networks.

4. We define layer and inter-layer reachability metrics of a given sub-network: this
measure is based on the private egocentric network and help to appreciate the
connectivity strength of private data across layers.

We illustrate our methodology through a biological application. The open multi-
layer network is constructed from open databases where weighted interactions between
proteins-proteins, metabolites-metabolites and proteins-metabolites are given. The pri-
vate data is a set of proteins and metabolites collected experimentally and present a set of
nodes in the open multilayer network. We show how the private network is constructed,
analysed and compared to the whole (open) network. The private egocentric network
is analysed and the layers reachability metrics are computed and discussed. Pathways
between pairs of private proteins are then analysed and classified according to their loca-
tion in the open network (private, egocentric or extra-egocentric). The KEGG (Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) open data set (Kanehisa and Goto 2000) is also

used to describe pathways.
Malek et al. Applied Network Science (2020) 5:41 Page 3 of 28

By applying this methodology on the biological data we show how it can help biol-
ogist to complete, assess and interpret their private data by using the open network:
weighted interactions between private collected molecules are added by using the open
network. The connectivity between the molecules inter-layers and across layers are com-
puted and the distribution of the identified molecules in the open network are observed
and interpreted, Reachabilities across layer is computed in addition shortest paths which
are biologically meaningful are also analysed and classified.

The rest of this paper is organised as follow: we present in “Multilayer network anal-
ysis elements” section elements and notions we use for multilayer networks analysis.
Related work are presented in “Related work” section. We present in “Biological applica-
tion” section the biological application. We finally present conclusion and perspectives

in “Conclusion and perspectives” section.

Multilayer network analysis elements

We firstly present a new formalism of multilayer network as well as examples showing
how we update global and local measures to the context of multilayer networks. We give
then a formal definitions of multilayer egocentric network, of private multilayer network
and of private egocentric one. We show then how we can use these notions to define the
layer and inter-layer reachabilites of a given sub-network.

Notations, properties and metrics
We represent a multilayer network by a tuple that contains a set of vertices, a set of edges
intra-layers and a set of edges inter-layers.

Let N = (V,E, C) be a graph containing / layers (see Fig. 1)

1 V={V,,..Vi,..V7} is the set of vertices contained in the layers where / is the number
of layers / > 1, V; is the set vertices in the layer number i, V; = {vi, Vis nj; =| V; |

2. EK = {£},..£;,..£)} is the set of edges intra-layer: FE; is a set of edges in layer number
i, we denote | E; | by m;. E; = {i %) | vi Ee V;,, vi Ee V;}!

3. C= {Cij,,-Cij, | ix A jx} is the set of inter-layer links , b is the number of
bipartite components. Cj, = {(vi, vi.) | vi E V;, vi, € Vj}, we denote | Cy | by cy.

This representation allows to propose an adaptation of global and local metrics taking
into account the intra-layers and the inter-layer links. We can then aggregate these met-
rics in order to propose a metric for the whole network. For example, we can propose the
following metric for the density:

e Intra-layer density for the layer i: Dj = ==!

 

nj*(nj—1)
2
e Inter-layer density for the bipartite component Cy:
oo
Di ~~ Nj*Nj

Licgec Ht Liter. MM
e Multilayer density: D = igeC Gi e{1.J}

nj*(nj—1)

Licgec MMT Det.)

Likewise, the degree centrality can be generalised to the inter-layer level and to the
whole networks. The centrality degree and connectivities of a vertex vi belonging to the
layer V; are given by:

 

An edge is defined by (v, u) for directed graph respectively {v, u} for undirected graph

Multilayer egocentric networks

Given a complex network (and more particularly an online social network), the egocentric
network is defined around an ego node u is a sub-network containing the ego u and the
alters (the neighbours) as well as the set of links of the ego-network. In the literature, two
cases of online personal networks are identified depending on the distance of the alters
from the ego: 1-level and k-level.

Let G = (V,E£), and ua vertex, the 1-level egocentric network of u G” = (V”,E”) is
given by (see Fig. 2) :

e V“= {xe V| (u,v) € FE} U {uy}

e F*={myeElxeV* Aye V"}

We propose an extension of this definition to multilayer networks which aims to access
to the alters located in the same layer as well as the layers connected to the one of the ego
(see Fig. 3).

Private multilayer network and private egocentric network
As mentioned before the purpose of this study is to provide domain experts with mea-
sures and methods to understand, evaluate and complete their private data by comparing
and/or combining them with open data when both are modelled by multilayer networks.
In our case, private data is a subset of nodes that are identified in the open network. The
interactions between these private nodes are extracted for the open network We there-
fore propose to study the induced graph elaborated from the private data. This one has to
be constructed, analysed and compared to the whole (open) network (see Fig. 4).

Let N bea multilayer network (extracted form the open data) : N = (V, E, C) containing
/ layers. Let PV be a set of vertices PV = {PV,..PV;} such that : PV; C V; (private data).
We define the private multilayer Network N[ PV] = (PV, PE, PC) where

1. PE = {PE\,..PE;,..PE;} is the set of intra-layers edges:

2. PC= {PCi,j, > PCinj, | ik # jx} is the set of inter-layer links

In Fig. 4, the blue graph represented the multilayer network N extracted from the
open data, red nodes represent the private data and the red graph illustrates the
private multilayer network N[ PV] .

We extend now the definition of egocentric network (which is defined around a given
ego node (Marsden 2002; Djemili et al. 2017)) to an egocentric network around private
multilayer network.

We define the private egocentric network as follow:

Let N[PV]= (PV,PE, PC) be the private mutilayer network. We define the private
egocentric network : N’Y = G (ve ViEP ")

In Fig. 5, red nodes represent the private data and the graph containing red and yellow
nodes and edges illustrates the private egocentric network N’Y

Layer and inter-layer reachability of a subnetwork
We define a graph reachability for a given layer as follow:

Let N = (V,E, C) bea multilayer network containing / layers, G = (V, E) a subgraph of
N and ia given layer.

@ Reachability(G,i) is given by the subgraph G; = (Vj, E;):
—- Vi=(whe VN Vi}
_ E= 1( v7, vit) cE nE)|
In order to appreciate the connection strength between private nodes across layer, we
apply the reachability on the private egocentric network computed on a given layer i to

another layer j. Let N°“ = G (ve Vi, EP 1) be the private egocentric network computed
from the layer i, let the reachability Reachability (NY Mi, j) to another layer j be the graph

recallR(i, j) is the ratio of private nodes of the layer j that are reachable from layer i to all

We define also a graph inter-layer reachability for a given bipartite part as follow. Let

and Cj is a given bipartie part.

e InterReachability(G, Cj) is given by the subgraph Gj = (Vj, i)

Given a bipartite part Cj, we can apply the InterReachability from the private induced

multilayer network or from the private egocentric one.

For example, let N[PV] be’ the private multilayer network, let
InterReachability(N| PV] , Cj) be the graph Ci, we can evaluate the reachable bipartite

Related work

Recently, there have been increasingly intense efforts to investigate networks with multi-
ple types of connections as well as the so-called “networks of networks”. Variants of such
systems have been examined decades ago in disciplines such sociology and engineer-
ing, but only recently have they been unified, along with other nomenclature, within the
framework of multilayer networks defined by Kivela et al.

In Kivela et al. (2014) a complete review of the field of multilayer network is presented,
the networks types, the characteristics of nodes and layers, the notion of aspect as well as
the nature of coupling between layers are detailed.

Many studies are currently addressing themes related to multilayer networks as struc-
ture and dynamics of multilayer networks (Boccaletti et al. 2014; Magnani and Rossi 2013;
Aleta and Moreno 2019), communities detection in multilayer networks (Liu et al. 2018)
and visualisation (Mcgee et al. 2019).

Many work show also that experts in multiple domains as digital humanities (McGee et
al. 2016), biology (Gosak et al. 2017), techno-anthropology etc. present their data using
Malek et al. Applied Network Science (2020) 5:41 Page 9 of 28

the multilayer networks and are aware of the strong necessity of having tools that analyse
their data (Kivela et al. 2019).

In this paper, we propose a methodology for multilayer network analysis in order to
provide domain experts with measures and methods to understand, evaluate and com-
plete their private data by comparing and/or combining them with open data when both
are modelled as multilayer networks.

This methodology uses a formalism based on a set of graphs some of them represent
layers (see “Notations, properties and metrics” section), others are biparties graphs rep-
resenting the inter-layers connections. This formalism allows us to clearly separate three
types of analysis: the intra-level one, the inter-level one and the global one that aggregate
both (intra and inter) levels.

In Kivela et al. (2014), a general formalism of the most general type of multilayer
network was proposed, an underlying graph that represents this multilayer network is
defined, where a node is represented by a tuple containing three identifiers: the node one,
the layer one and the aspect one. In addition, two types of edges are proposed: intra-layer
edges and inter-layer ones.

Our formalism for multilayer network allows to carry out fine analysis by considering
two levels (see “Notations, properties and metrics” section) : the intra-layer level and the
inter-layer one. We showed above, examples of how we can extend the definition of global
and local measures as density and centralities to the inter-layer level. Measures for the
whole networks are then computed by aggregating both precedent measures.

In many other work (Battiston et al. 2014), a monoplex network is constructed by aggre-
gating data from the different layers of a multilayer network, the classical definition of
node degree is then applied to the resulting monoplex network. However, network aggre-
gation leads to a loss of information. In Some other work, the distinction of the layers
is maintained and the degree of node is represented by a vector. It is also possible to
define degree and neighbourhood in terms of a focal node and any subset of the layers
(Berlingerio et al. 2013).

On the other hand, we defined layer and inter-layer reachability metrics of a given
sub-network this measure is based on the private egocentric network and help to appre-
ciate the connectivity strength of private data across layers (see “Layer and inter-layer
reachability of a subnetwork” section) .

In Kivela et al. (2014) the mesure of node interdependence is defined as being the ratio
of shortest paths in which two or more layers are used to the total number of shortest
paths. It is a measure to quantify the value added by the multiplexicity to the reach-
ability of nodes. The interdependence of a multiplex is computed as the average node
interdependence.

Biological application

The aim of this application is to study several sets of biological data collected in exper-
imentally related samples (i.e. cannabis samples). Identified molecules (proteins and
metabolites) are measured form the biological collected data in different “omics” exper-
iments: transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. In their experiments, biologist
measured at several time points, contigs: each one quantify genes, spots: each one quan-
tify one or more proteins, and metabolites. Each gene produce typically one protein but

sometimes more proteins.

At this point we only have nodes (but no edges), corresponding to molecules mea-
sured in the experiments. To get relationships biologist frequently used the open STRING
(Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) database (Szklarczyk et al.
2019), which is the main protein-protein (and so also gene-gene) interactions database
as well as the STITCH (Search Tool for InTeractions of CHemicals) one. STITCH
(Szklarczyk et al. 2016) is a twin database including edges between metabolites and
metabolites, and also between proteins and metabolites (see Fig. 8). Each interac-
tion in both databases is based on the presence of experimental, coexpression (similar
behaviour across several public available experiment), text mining (appearing in the same
phrase),pathway (participating to the same known biological network). A combined score
ageregating all these types of interactions whose value is are between 0 and 1000 is added
to both databases (see Tables 1, 2 and 3).

The open multilayer network is constructed form the open STRING and STITCH
databases (see Fig. 8). Weighted interactions (edges) between proteins-proteins,
metabolites-metabolites and proteins-metabolites are created according to the value of

the combined score. The private data is the set of identified proteins and metabolites col-

lected experimentally in the laboratory by biologists as mentioned above and will present

a set of nodes in the whole open data as explained in Fig. 4.

Once the regulatory network has been sketched, it shall be analysed. The complexity

of the network shall be reduced, by selecting significant interactions. Biologists need to

identify key nodes (molecules) shortest paths, sort them via centrality measures between

given ends and track the path from a receptor to transcription factors and vice versa.

From a biological point of view we remind that:

1.

Biologists are often interested to find neighbours of molecules (and more
particularity proteins), hence the necessity to analyse the private egocentric
network.

Biologists need to extract and analyse signal transduction and metabolic pathways
from the network. Shortest path is biologically meaningful as energetically the most
favorable for detecting the signal transduction interactions as well as the metabolic
pathways.

Signal transduction represent a series of interactions between different bioentities
such as proteins, chemicals or macromolecules in order to investigate how signal
transmission is performed either from the outside to the inside of the cell, or within
the cell.

Likewise, metabolic pathways are related to a series of chemical reactions
occurring within a cell at different time points holding information about a series

of biochemical events and the way they are correlated we consider.

To analyse the biological network we proceed as follow:

1.

Analysis of each layer (proteins and metabolites layers)

(a) The layer is constructed from the open data base (STRING and STITCH).
Private network is also constructed from the set of identified molecules
(proteins and metabolites) collected from the cannabis samples
experiment, where biological data are collected in different “omics”

experiments: transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics.

(b) Global and local measures are compared and discussed for open and
private networks, we apply the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008) in
order to detect communities, private (identified from experiment)

molecules distribution is studied according to the detected communities.
2. Multi-layer network analysis:

(a) The bipartite component containing the interactions proteins-metabolites
is constructed from the open STITCH data base. The whole multilayer
networks, the private multilayer network as well as the private egocentric
networks are also constructed.

(b) Networks global and local measures are compared and discussed.

(c) Layer reachablities from metabolites to proteins and from proteins to
metabolites are computed and discussed.

(d) Shortest paths between pairs of private proteins are then analysed and
classified according to their location in the open network (private,
egocentric or extra-egocentric). The KEGG open data set (Kanehisa and
Goto 2000) is also used to describe pathways.

Open biological databases are very big in relation to the average high throughput bio-
logical experiment. In our case the proteins in the experiment represent only form 0.58%
to 0.74% of the total number of proteins in the whole network. The metabolites in the
experiment represent less than 0.05% of the total number of metabolites in the whole
network.

Proteins layer analysis

Table 4 shows the distribution of the combined score values. Combined scores express

strength interactions between two proteins according to the open STRING database.
Figure 9 shows that the distribution of the values of the combined scores is similar to

scale free network behaviour.

1. Network construction We construct the proteins layer by considering the
combined score as threshold: if we take the minimum score (150) all the
interactions are considered otherwise a part of the network is considered according
the chosen percentile (see Fig. 10). When the combined core value is incremented
some nodes will be disconnected. These nodes are dropped from the network. The
private network is constructed also. (see Appendix A for more details)

Identified proteins in the experiment present only form 0.58% to 0.74% from the
total number of proteins in the open network (see Table 5).

Network densities do not vary a lot between the open and the private networks
which means that the identified proteins (in the experiment) are almost balanced
distributed in the whole protein layer.

We notice also that from the 75th percentile, certain identified proteins begin to be
missed (see Appendix A for more details).

Network construction As for proteins layer, we construct the metabolites layer by
considering the combined score as threshold, if we take the minimum score (2) the
whole network is constructed networks otherwise a part of the network is
considered according the chosen percentile (see Fig. 12).

We notice that the identified metabolites in the experiment present less than 0.05%
from the total number of metabolites in the whole network. However the private
metabolites networks extracted form the experiment present high density in
comparison with the open ones (see Appendix B for more details). This means that
the metabolites of the experiment are highly connected by pairs (see Table 7).
Degree distribution:

Results show that the identified metabolites have very high degree centralities (see
Appendix B for more details). This means they are strongly connected connected
by pairs according to the STITCH open data base (see Table 7).

Communities detection : We apply the Louvain algorithm to the metabolites
layer (Blondel et al. 2008), we obtain a modularity of is 0.46. 39 communities are
detected from the principal connected component for the minimum combined

score (see Appendix B):

We notice that a majority of the metabolites are present in only two communities.
This results is correlated with the high density value of the private metabolite
network and means that metabolites are strongly connected and forms mainly two

highly connected subnetworks.

analysis.

1. Networks construction: We construct the protein-metabolite bipartite part by

considering the combined score as threshold, if we take the minimum score the
whole network is constructed otherwise a part of the network is considered
according the chosen percentile. The 2-layer network is then constructed by
considering the proteins and the metabolites layers. The private 2-layers network
extracted from the experiment as well the private egocentric one are also
constructed.

Results (see Appendix C) show that:

e The ratio of identified molecules (proteins and metabolites) in the experiment
is 0.1% compared to the open 2-layers networks but decreases to [0.9%, 1.42%]
in the private egocentric network.

e the density of the private networks obtained from the experiment is 100 to
165 bigger that the one of the open network but it is only 1,65 bigger than the

one of egocentric network.

Proteins and metabolites reachabilities: Table 8 shows that private egocentric
metabolites networks reaches (see “Layer and inter-layer reachability of a
subnetwork” section) a set of proteins that contains 51% to 67% of the identified

proteins despite a very low precision.

Likewise, Table 9) shows that private egocentric proteins networks reaches

(see “Layer and inter-layer reachability of a subnetwork” section) a set of metabolites
that contains 53% to 84% of the identified metabolites despite a very low precision.
These results show that a majority of identified metabolites (in the experiment) are
reachable from all the identified proteins and vice-versa. This will help biologist to
classify molecules into neighbours ones and distant ones.

We present in next sections two methods for proteins pathway analysis: the first one is
based on analysing the shortest paths between pairs of private proteins and the second
one is based on using the affiliation network extracted from the open KEGG Database
(Kanehisa and Goto 2000).

Proteins pathways analysis using shortest paths
shortest path is biologically meaningful as energetically the most favorable. The private
protein networks is composed of 142 proteins (see Table 16, shortest paths are computed
between 20164 pairs of proteins. Table 10 shows the number and percentage of shortest
paths classified by theirs lengths

We can thus propose a classification of the obtained shortest paths into three classes
according to their location in the whole proteins networks :

1. Shortest paths whose lengths are less than or equal two: these pathways belong to
the private protein network.

2. Shortest paths whose lengths are less than or equal four: these ones can either
reach the egocentric networks or belong completely to the private one.

3. Shortest paths whose lengths are more than four: these ones can either reach the
open networks, or belong completely to the egocentric or the private one

We notice that the majority of found shortest paths belong to the egocentric network
(or the private one) so they are in the neighbours of the private network nodes. Only few
of them (3,37 %) can be outside the egocentric networks. These few long shortest paths
can be isolated and studied by biologists in order to understand the molecule interactions
into these paths. Table 11 shows two shortest paths pf length 6 composed of proteins and
metabolites: one have some nodes outside the egocentric network and the other one is
completely inside the egocentric network and the other one

Proteins pathways analysis using the KEGG data base

KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is an open database resource that
integrates genomic, chemical and systemic functional information. In particular, gene cat-
alogs from completely sequenced genomes are linked to higher-level systemic functions
of the cell, the organism and the ecosystem (Kanehisa and Goto 2000).

Major efforts have been undertaken to manually create a knowledge base for such
systemic functions by capturing and organising experimental knowledge in computable
forms; namely, in the forms of molecular networks called KEGG pathway maps, BRITE
functional hierarchies and KEGG modules.

From the KEGG data set we extract 4692 proteins which are associated to Pathway iden-
tifiers. Each identifier is also related to a pathway name that characterised the molecules
(see Tables 12 and 13). There are 238 pathways .

Our goal is to use this data set in order to characterise the set of private proteins
extracted from the experiment. We represent the affiliation of private proteins by an affil-
iation network extracted from the KEGG database and modelled by a bipartite graph
containing the set of private proteins connected to pathway identifiers (see Fig. 14). Bipar-
tite networks are a particular class of complex networks, whose nodes are divided into
two sets X and Y, and only connections between two nodes in different sets are allowed.
Bipartite networks can usually be compressed by one-mode projection. This means that
the ensuing network contains nodes of only either of the two sets, X (or, alternatively, Y)
nodes are connected only if when they have at least one common neighbouring Y (or,
alternatively, X) node (see Fig. 15).

We consider the pathway networks obtained by one-mode projection on the pathways
set. Table 14 shows the characteristics of this network.

In order to characterise the private proteins data set we proceed as follow: we firstly
apply the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008) to the pathway on-mode projection
network in order to detect communities. Pathways that belong to the same community
are similar in the the sens that they are associated to some proteins in commun.

We then analyse the pathways of the private proteins set in comparison with each com-
munity. Let PathE be the set of pathways associated to the private proteins. Let PathC;

2. The experiment recall given by Path OP AInE measures the rate of private proteins
pathways among all the private proteins pathways.
3. The jaccard Index given by Pa Pane measures the rate of private proteins

included in this community and that have an affiliation

Table 15 shows results concerning the found communities, some of them correspond to
isolated pathways (of cardinality one) that do not have private proteins affiliation (exper-
iment precision is equal to 0) or that have isolated affiliation (experiment precision is
1).

Each community can be described by a set of pathway names (see Table 13). The
community 9 have the better Jaccard index with the set of private proteins. It has the
following pathways description :["Oxidative phosphorylation", "N-Glycan biosynthesis"

wom

, ‘Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism" ,"Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes", "RNA
transport" ,"RNA degradation" “Spliceosome’, “Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis’, “Protein
processing in endoplasmic reticulum’, “Circadian rhythm” ]

We aim to study these pathways in order to show if the list of metabolites and pro-
teins found on the pathways are biologically significant. We aim also to compare them to

shortest paths and their relations to the private egocentric network.

Results discussion

We discuss in this section results obtained from the application of our methodology to
the above biological application. We present observations and results related to one layer
and those obtained for the whole network.

Observations and results obtained from one layer analysis
Our analysis methodology allows biologists to compare and assess identified molecules
and private networks with the open ones as described follows (see Tables 5 and 7):

e Firstly, the rate of the identified molecules is computed in relation to the open
network. This helps biologists to position the identified molecules in comparison
with the open data. In our case, open biological databases are very big in relation to
the average high throughput biological experiment. The proteins in the experiment

represent only form 0.58% to 0.74% of the total number of proteins in the whole
network. The metabolites in the experiment represent less than 0.05% of the total
number of metabolites in the whole network.

The open and private networks’ densities measures are computed and compared, this
gives an indication about the strengths of connections in the set of identified

molecules in comparison with the open data. In our case, we notice that the open and

the private proteins networks have almost the same density, on the other hand, the
private metabolites network have high density in comparison with the open one.
The average degrees are computed for three set of nodes: the average degree of the
open network, the average degree of the private one and the one for the set of
identified molecules in the open one. Comparing these values helps biologists to
appreciate the strength of connections between the identified molecules and all the
other molecules in comparison with the strength of connection between all the
molecules. In our case, degree values of identified proteins do not vary a lot in
comparison to other proteins. On the other hand, identified metabolites have very
high degree centralities, this means they are strongly connected to other metabolites
(see Tables 5 and 7).

In order to have an idea about the distribution of the identified molecules in the
network, we apply the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008) in order to detect
communities, private molecules (identified from experiment) distribution is studied
according to the detected communities. In our case, eight communities are detected
for the protein layer. The rate of distribution of identified proteins in these
communities is €| 0, 48%; 0, 77%], this means Identified proteins are almost
distributed in a balanced way in communities. Notice that theses rates is comparable
to the global rate of identified proteins in the one network. On the other hand, 39
communities are detected for the metabolite layer. 80% of the identified metabolites
belong only to 2 communities, this means that a majority of the Identified
metabolites are strongly connected and forms two highly connected subnetworks.
Biologists have confirmed these results by identifying two known categories of
metabolites (see Tables 5 and 7).

Observations and results obtained from two layers analysis

e The computation of layer reachablities from metabolites to proteins and from
proteins to metabolites allow biologists to appreciate the ratio of immediate
interactions between private molecules (identified in their experience) in comparison
with the open data. Table 8 shows that private egocentric metabolites networks
reaches (see “Layer and inter-layer reachability of a subnetwork” section) a set of
proteins that contains 51% to 67% of the identified proteins despite a very low
precision (0.6% to 0.64%).

Likewise, Table 9) shows that private egocentric proteins networks reaches

(see “Layer and inter-layer reachability of a subnetwork” section) a set of metabolites
that contains 53% to 84% of the identified metabolites despite a very low precision
(0.56% to 0.7%).

e Analysing shortest paths which are biologically meaningful between pairs of private
proteins could be very helpful for biologists. We propose to classify them according
to their location in the open network (private, egocentric or extra-egocentric). In our
case, we notice that the majority of found shortest paths belong to the egocentric
network (or the private one) so they are in the neighbours of the private network
nodes. Only few of them (3,37 % ) can be outside the egocentric networks. These few
long shortest paths can be isolated and studied by biologists in order to understand
the molecule interactions into these paths.

e By using the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto 2000), we proposed to characterise
the set of private proteins identified from the experiment by pathways description
presented as a list of pathway names. We aim to study these pathways in order to
show if the list of metabolites and proteins found on the pathways are biologically
significant. We aim also to compare them to found shortest paths and their relations
to the private egocentric network.

Conclusion and perspectives

We presented in this paper a methodology including measures and methods which helps
domain experts to understand, evaluate and complete their private data by comparing
and/or combining them with open data, when both are modelled by multilayer networks.

We proposed a new formalism for multilayer network that allows to carry out fine
analysis by considering two levels: the intra-layer level and the inter-layer one.

We introduced the notions of private multilayer network and private egocentric net-
work which is defined around the private multilayer network. The private egocentric
network is used to evaluate the connectivity strength between the different layers of pri-
vate data in comparison to the open network. We showed how we can use these notions
to define the layer and inter-layer reachability metrics of a given sub-network.

We illustrated our methodology through a biological application where interactions
between molecules (proteins and metabolites) are extracted from open databases and
modelled by a multilayer network. The private data is a set of proteins and metabolites
collected experimentally and presented a set of nodes in the whole multilayer network.
Current experimental results are relevant from biologists point of view.

We showed that the application of this methodology allows biologists to compare and
assess identified molecules and private networks with the open one.

Computing open and private networks mesures for the different layers and as densities
and degrees helps biologists to appreciate the strength of internal connections between
the identified molecules and to compare with the one of connections to other molecules
as well as to the global measures. Likewise, applying communities detection algorithms
in the different layers gives an idea about the distribution of the identified molecules in
the open network. Computing reachablities across layers (from metabolites to proteins
and from proteins to metabolites) helps to appreciate the ratio of immediate interactions
between private molecules as well as the set of open molecules reachable from the iden-
tified ones ; we remind that biologists are interested by finding neighbours of molecules
and to make the distinction between those private and open. In addition, shortest paths
which are biologically meaningful are also analysed and classified according to their loca-
tion in the whole network (private, egocentric or extra-egocentric ones). The KEGG open
data set (Kanehisa and Goto 2000) is also used to describe pathways.

We are currently working on communities detection (Fortunato 2010) across layer. We
use layers and inter-layers reachabilities metrics in order to propose algorithm(s) allowing
the comparisons and the mapping of communities across layers.

From a biological point of view, we aim to study which KEGG pathways are highlighted
in order to show if the molecules connecting private ones are biologically significant.
In such analysis we aim to compare: the list of metabolites and proteins found on the
pathway, with all first neighbours, with the geocentric networks as well as with shortest

paths.

3. Communities detection: We apply the Louvain algorithm to the metabolites layer

(Blondel et al. 2008), we obtain a modularity of is 0.46. 39 communities are detected

from the principal connected component for the minimum combined score:

@ 22 have their cardinalities between 3 and 28

e 11 have their cardinalities between 1000 and 10000
e 6 have their cardinalities between 15000 and 30000

We show in Table 3 the distribution of the main identified metabolites.
