Abstract

Learning is a natural human activity that is shaped by personal experiences,
cognitive awareness, personal bias, opinions, cultural background, and environment.
Learning has been defined as a stable and persistent change in what a person
knows and can do. Learning is formed through an individual's interactions, including
the conveyance of knowledge and skills from others and experiences. So, learning is
a personalized experience that allows one to expand their knowledge, perspective,
skills, and understanding. Therefore, personalized learning models can help to meet

individual needs and goals. Furthermore, to personalize the learning experience,
technology integration can play a crucial role. This paper provides a review of the
recent research literature on personalized learning as technology is changing how
learning can be effectively personalized. The emphasis is on the terms used to
characterize learning as those can suggest a framework for personalized and will
eventually be used in meta-analyses of research on personalized learning, which is
beyond the scope of this paper.

Introduction

Personalized learning has been a topic of research for a long time. However, around
2008, personalized learning started to draw more attention and take on a transformed
meaning as seen in Fig. 1. However, we believe the variety of terms that have been
used for personalized learning seems to be an obstacle to the progress of personalized
learning theories and research. Although there exists an abundance of the resources/
studies on personalized learning, not having a readily agreed-upon term of personal-
ized learning might be the obstacle in research progress on personalized learning. In
response to this need, this paper is focused on analyzing the terms that have been used
for personalized learning. A distinctly personalized learning approach can help the
educational researchers to build up research on previous data, instead of trying to start
new research from scratch each time. This paper will present a research-based frame-
work for personalized learning and discuss future research directions, issues, and chal-
lenges through an in-depth analysis of the definitions and terms used for personalized

learning.

Published Personalized Learning Papers

     

 

Fig. 1 The number of published papers on “personalized learning”

Personalized learning has existed for hundreds of years in the form of apprenticeship

and mentoring. As educational technologies began to mature in the last half of the pre-
vious century, personalized learning took the form of intelligent tutoring systems. In
this century, big data and learning analytics are poised to transform personalized learn-
ing once again. Learning has been characterized as a stable and persistent change in
what a person knows and can do (Spector, 2015). Personalized learning is a complex
activity approach that is the product of self-organization (Chatti, 2010; Miliband, 2006)
or learning and customized instruction that considers individual needs and goals. Per-
sonalized learning can be an efficient approach that can increase motivation, engage-
ment and understanding (Pontual Falcéo, e Peres, Sales de Morais and da Silva
Oliveira, 2018), maximizing learner satisfaction, learning efficiency, and learning effect-
iveness (G6mez, Zervas, Sampson and Fabregat, 2014). However, while such personal-
ized learning is now possible, it remains as one of the biggest challenges in modern
educational systems. In this paper a review of progress in personalized learning using
current technologies is provided. The emphasis is on the characteristics of personalized
learning that need to be taken into consideration to have a well-developed concept of
personalized learning.

We started with the definition of personalized learning suggested by Spector (2014,
2018) and others that are discussed below, which requires a digital learning environ-
ment to be classified as a personalized learning environment to be adaptive to individ-
ual knowledge, experience and interests and to be effective and efficient in supporting
and promoting desired learning outcomes. These characteristics are those which are
typically discussed in the research community although we found it challenging to find
a sufficient number of published cases that reported effect sizes and details of the sam-
ple in order to conduct a formal meta-analysis. Lacking those cases suggests that per-
sonalized learning in the digital era is still in its infancy. As a result, we conducted a
more informal albeit systematic review of published research on personalized learning.

Furthermore, we, along with many educational technologists, believe an efficient per-
sonalized learning approach can increase learners’ motivation and engagement in learn-
ing activities so that improved learning results. While that outcome now seems
achievable, it remains a largely unrealized opportunity according to this research re-
view. Truong (2016) stated that providing the same content to students with different
qualifications and personal traits and having different interests and needs is not
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 3 of 20

considered adequate anymore when learning can now be personalized. Miliband (2006,
as cited in Lee, Huh, Lin and Reigeluth, 2018) promoted personalized learning to be
the solution to tailoring the learning according to individuals’ needs and prior experi-
ence so as to allow everyone to reach their maximum potential through customized in-
struction (Hsieh and Chen, 2016; Lin, Yeh, Hung and Chang, 2013).The customized
instruction that includes what is taught, how it is taught, and the pace at which it is
taught. This allows learning to meet individual needs, interests and circumstances
which can be quite diverse (Brusilovsky and Peylo, 2003; Liu and Yu, 2011). Further-
more, FitzGerald et al. (2018) pointed out the personalization of learning is now a re-
curring trend across government agencies, popular media, conferences, research
papers, and technological innovations.

Personalized learning is in demand (Huang, Liang, Su and Chen, 2012) due to
new technologies involving big data and learning analytics. It should be tailored to
and continuously modified to an individual learner’s conditions, abilities, prefer-
ences, background knowledge, interests, and goals and adaptable to the learner’s
evolving skills and knowledge (Sampson, Karagiannidis and Kinshuk, 2002;
Sharples, 2000). Today’s personalized learning theories are inspired by educational
philosophy from the progressive era in the previous century, especially John
Dewey’s (1915, 1998) emphasis on experiential, learner-centered learning, social
learning, extension of the curriculum, and fitting for a changing world. McCombs
and Whisler (1997; as cited in Lee et al., 2018) claimed that a learner-centered en-
vironment develops as it considers learners’ unique characteristics using the best
knowledge of teaching and learning which are available. Furthermore, Lockspeiser
and Kaul (2016) claimed that individualized learning is a tool to facilitate learner-
centered education. FitzGerald et al. (2018) pointed out that personalization is a
crucial topic of current interest in technology-oriented learning design and discus-
sion for government policymakers, but less so in educational research. This might
be a good explanation of disunity of personalized learning approaches.

On the other hand, Niknam and Thulasiraman (2020) argued that educational society
has been interested in having a personalized learning system that adjusts the pedagogy,
curriculum, and learning environment for learners to meet their learning needs and
preferences. A personalized learning system can adapt itself when providing learning
support to different learners to defeat the weakness of one-size-fits-all approaches in
technology-enabled learning systems. The goal is to have a learning system that can dy-
namically adapt itself based on a learner’s characteristics and needs to provide person-
alized learning. Human one-on-one tutors can do this and now it is possible for digital
systems to do so as well. Schmid and Petko (2019) pointed out that a look at inter-
national research literature shows that personalized learning is a multilayered construct
with numerous definitions and various forms of implementation. Which supports our
claim that one of the most critical problems with personalized learning is, there is no
readily agreed-upon meaning of the phrase ‘personalized learning’. Schmid and Petko
(2019) supported this claim by stating that a clearly defined concept of personalized
learning is still lacking; instead, it serves as an umbrella term for educational strategies
that try to do justice to the individual’s abilities, knowledge, and learning needs of each
student. Spector (2013) claimed that there would be more robust information to sup-

port personalized learning as technology develops. So many different terms have been
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 4 of 20

used in the replacement of ‘personalized learning’. Researchers could not locate a sys-
tematic literature review on personalized learning terms that review the terms that have
been used for personalized learning, and it is important to address this need. Therefore,
this review was done to close that gap and respond to the need for a unified, personal-
ized learning term. As a result, personalized learning definitions and the terms that
have been used interchangeably, such as adaptive learning, individualized instruction,
and customized learning are analyzed in this paper. These terms were chosen because
they have been most used in the education field (Reisman, 2014). In the next several
sections, each term will be defined, and their relationship with personalized learning
will be discussed. The analysis of these terms guided the systematic review of the re-
search literature that follows.

Adaptive learning

Most educators recognize the advantages of adaptive learning, but evidence-based re-
search stays limited as adaptive learning is still evolving (Liu, McKelroy, Corliss and
Carrigan, 2017). Adaptive learning is one of the terms that has been used interchange-
ably with personalized learning. The adaptive learning system is built on principles that
have been around for a very long time dating back to the era of apprenticeship training
and human tutoring. However, many other labels such as individualized instruction,
self-paced instruction, and personalized instruction were used interchangeably while
trying to produce the most suitable sequence of learning units for each learner (Garcia-
Cabot, De-Marcos and Garcia-Lopez, 2015; Reisman, 2014). While early forms of adap-
tive learning (e.g., apprenticeship training and human tutoring) only dealt with one or a
very small number of learners, the current interest is using adaptive learning for large
numbers of learners, which is why there is such interest in big data and learning
analytics.

For instance, adaptive learning has been interchangeably used by Yang, Hwang and
Yang (2013) in their study that focused on the development of adaptive learning by
considering students’ preferences (Dwivedi and Bharadwaj, 2013) and characteristics,
including learning styles (Cakiroglu, 2014; Klasnja-Milicevi¢, Vesin, Ivanovic and Budi-
mac, 2011) and cognitive styles (Lo, Chan and Yeh, 2012) which concluded to be effect-
ive. Wang and Liao (2011) defined adaptive learning as a developed system (Lu, Chang,
Kinshuk, Huang and Chen, 2014) to accommodate a variety of individual differences
(Scheiter et al., 2019; Wang & Liao, 2011) such as gender, learning motivation, cogni-
tive type, and learning style to determine optimal adaptive learning experience that ac-
commodates a variety of individual differences (Afini Normadhi et al., 2019) to remove
barriers of time and location. Griff and Matter (2013) discussed that adaptive learning
is also referred to as computer-based learning, adaptive educational hypermedia, and
intelligent tutoring. Furthermore, Hooshyar, Ahmad, Yousefi, Yusop and Horng (2015)
used personalized and adaptive learning to explain the importance of the Intelligent
Tutoring System (Aeiad and Meziane, 2019) for implementing one-to-one personalized
and adaptive teaching. “Although the terms ‘personalized learning’ and ‘adaptive learn-
ing’ are different, they are often used interchangeably in various studies” (Aroyo et al.,
2006; Gobel et al., 2010; Gomez et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013, as cited in Xie, Chu,
Hwang and Wang, 2019, p.2).
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 5 of 20

Based on this review, adaptive learning systems are defined as those that are comput-
erized learning systems that adapt learning content, presentation styles, or learning
paths based on individual students’ profiles, learning status, or human factors (Chen,
Liu and Chang, 2006; Tseng et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013).

Individualized instruction

Individualized instruction is one of the terms that are often used to talk about the spe-
cific needs and goals of individuals to be addressed during instruction. U.S. Department
of Education (2010) defined personalized learning as involving customizing the learning
pace to individual learners (individualization), tailoring instructional methods (differen-
tiation), and personalizing learning content. This notion has evolved from one-on-one
human tutoring. It is not agreed upon whether individualization is a component of per-
sonalized learning or another term that can be used in place of personalized learning.
The review results show that instead of being a component, individualized instruction
has been used as a replacement term for personalized learning and is a product of per-
sonalized learning. Chatti, Jarke and Specht (2010) and Chou, Lai, Chao, Lan and Chen
(2015) had used both terms without defining/explaining how they relate to each other.
Bahceci and Giirol (2016) created a portal that offers individualized learning content
based on the individual’s level of cognitive knowledge. Bahceci and Giirol (2016) stated
that education should be done by recognizing the individual differences of the students
such as students learning styles (Cakiroglu, 2014; KlaSnja-Milicevic et al., 2011) and
characteristics. The researchers observed that Bahceci and Giirol (2016) used individu-
alized learning and personalized learning interchangeably without pointing out that
they were doing so.

Also, most individualized learning studies have used individualized instruction to
refer to IEP (individualized educational plans) for students with disabilities to accom-
modate their needs and goals. Even though individualized instruction is suggested as an
approach that individualize material to improve the learning experience for students
with learning disabilities, it can benefit all students (Barrio et al., 2017; Ko, Chiang, Lin
and Chen, 2011). Personalized learning considers students’ interests, needs, readiness,
and motivation and adapts to their progress by situating the learner at the center of the
learning process. Individualized learning allows for individualization of learning based
on the learner’s unique needs (Cavanagh, 2014; Lockspeiser & Kaul, 2016). While a
learner-centered paradigm of education has influenced personalized learning, the
current teacher-student ratios in school systems seem to be an obstacle to make learn-
ing experiences personalized for individual students without technology (Lee et al.,
2018), with the exception of the requirement for IEPs in many school districts. We fol-
low the definition offered by the U.S. Department of Education and note that individu-
alized learning in school systems requires significant technology support, such as big
data and learning analytics.

Customized learning
While Lee et al. (2018) suggested a learner-centered system that supports diverse needs
and development of individual learners’ potentials. This system develops customized in-

structional methods and learning content for individual learners with unique
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 6 of 20

characteristics and interests. Lee et al. (2018) suggested that learner-centered learning
and personalized learning are blended and considered together. Lee et al. (2018) de-
fined a personalized learning plan (PLP) that refers to a customized instructional plan
(Somyiirek, 2015) that considers individual differences and needs, characteristics, inter-
ests, and academic mastery. The PLP includes the notions of individualization, differen-
tiation, and personalization that allows learning to be personally relevant, engaging,
appropriate to the learners’ capabilities, and respectful of individual differences, making
learning useful and motivational.

The review of those three terms reveals a great deal of overlap with an em-
phasis on the need to use technology to support such efforts. This study reviews
definitions of personalized learning terms used in research papers from 2010 to
2020 by systematically reviewing the literature to compare the similarities and dif-
ferences in definitions of each of these terms. The hope is to synthesize the terms
used for personalized learning so the researchers can analyze and go through the
research in the field and conduct meta-analyses and syntheses of the research lit-
erature. Also, analyzing the definitions of the term ‘personalized learning’, ‘adap-
tive learning’, ‘individualized instruction’, and ‘customized learning’ that have
been used can help to develop a unified definition for personalized learning that
can lead a framework. The framework can help with having a common under-
standing of personalized learning rather than a collection of loosely defined sys-
tems. A unified description of personalized learning and analyzing the studies
related to personalized learning can help consolidate findings and suggest new
areas to explore.

Our idea of personalized learning rests on the foundation that humans learn through
experience and by constructing knowledge. Constructivism claims that learners’ ac-
quired knowledge and understanding, determine learning ability and that knowledge
acquisition is a process of construction according to individuals’ experience (Ormrod,
2011). Personalized learning is influenced by a learner’s prior experiences, backgrounds,
interests, needs, goals, and motivation. Moreover, it is accomplished via meaningful in-
teractions in individual learners’ lives. Furthermore, no conscious effort is needed to be
actively learning while engaged in everyday life (Kinshuk, 2012) although reflection and
mega-cognition can promote learning.

Adaptive instruction, blended instruction, differentiation, customized instruction,
individualized learning, adaptive learning, proactive supports, real-world connec-
tions, and applications are hallmarks of good personalized learning. In general,
personalized-learning models seek to adapt to the pace of learning and the instruc-
tional strategies, content and activities being used to fit best each learner’s
strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Personalized learning is about giving students
some control over their learning (Benhamdi, Babouri and Chiky, 2017; Jung, Kim,
Yoon, Park and Oakley, 2019; Tomberg, Laanpere, Ley and Normak, 2013), differ-
entiating instruction for each learner, and providing real-time individualized feed-
back to teachers and learners (Nedungadi and Raman, 2012), which is all
effortlessly blended throughout the learning activity. Putting a framework together
can help with a practical personalized learning model for all. The model can be
developed and evolved as technology develops and we learn more about human

learning and machine learning.

Research methodology
For this review, the guidelines published by Okoli to conducting a systematic literature
review for Information Systems Research were adapted (Okoli, 2015). Okoli’s work pro-
vides a detailed framework for writing a systematic literature review with its roots
in information technology. As this systematic literature review is rooted in infor-
mation technology, it was deemed appropriate to use Okoli’s work as the basis for
this body of work.

Okoli presented eight significant steps that need to be followed to conduct a scientif-
ically, rigorous systematic literature review. These steps are listed below:

1. Identify the purpose: The researchers identified the purpose and intended goals
of the study to ensure the review is clear to readers.

2. Draft protocol and train the team: Reviewers agreed on procedures to follow to
ensure consistency in how they complete the review.

3. Apply practical inclusion screen: Reviewers were specific about what studies
they considered for review and which ones they eliminated without further
examination. The reviewers created four phases to review papers to produce the
final papers to review.

4, Search for literature: Reviewers described the literature search details and
justified how they ensured the search’s comprehensiveness.

5. Extract data: After reviewers identified all the studies to be included in the review,
they systematically extract the applicable information from each study by going
through four review phases they explained in search query.

6. Appraise quality: The reviewers explicitly listed the criteria used to decide which
papers they will exclude for insufficient quality in the search query. Researchers
reviewed all papers and decided on final papers after explicit four search phases.
They finalized the papers to be reviewed, depending on the content of the papers’
content and quality.

7. Synthesize studies: The researchers analyzed the data obtained from the studies
using appropriate qualitative techniques.

8. Write the review: The process of a systematic literature review was explicitly
described in adequate detail that other researchers can independently reproduce

the review’s results.

Research question

This literature review promotes research around personalized learning in informa-
tional education. To fulfill answer of “What are the similarities and differences of
different terms used for personalized learning approaches?” we need a research
base and theoretical framework that provides answers to basic questions. Further-
more, the following questions are sub-questions to be considered during the

study.

How is personalized learning defined?
How adaptive learning has been used and how it relates to personalized learning?
3. How individualized instruction has been used and how it relates to personalized

learning?
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 8 of 20

4, How is customized learning connected to personalized learning?
5. What components need to be included in a well-defined personalized learning

term?

Also, researchers are seeking a unified definition of personalized learning that will in-
clude all those different components. That is the focus of this literature review was
conducted.

Sources of literature

To answer the research question, the researchers have selected the following well
known and reputable databases to base this literature review: Scopus, Science Direct,
EBSCOhost, IEEE Xplore, JSTOR, and Web of Science to ensure all related journals of
the field are included. The most relevant journals for the systematic review were chosen
consistently from these databases. Also, Google Scholar h5-index for the category “Edu-
cational technology” was used as the starting point since this category is a specific cat-
egory for personalized learning studies.

Databases in which to base this literature review are listed in Table 1.

The top nine journals from the “Educational Technology” category from google
scholar h5-index selected to keep the range of the papers manageable while trying to
ensure the review is broad enough to include enough studies that can satisfactorily an-
swer the research question. Later, most of the journals about educational technology
were indexed. SJR (SCIMAGO JOURNAL RANK) was used to validate the impact of
the selected journals. Even though the impact factor is not perfectly aligned with Goo-
gle Scholar’s h5-index order, the selected journals listed the most impactful journals in
the educational technology field. Also, even though Journal of Learning Analytics was
listed on google scholar and showed having a high impact on education technology, re-
searchers have not located any qualified paper according to selection procedures, thus
this journal was eliminated from review.

This review solely retrieved peer-reviewed article papers from online journals be-
cause those online academic journals are known to be reliable and authoritative.
They allow the readers to verify the facts from their sources, which increases the
reliability of enriched studies filled with data and facts. They enable the readers to
perform comprehensive research and allow the reader to access more data without
the limitations of space and time. A defined method was set in this research for
selecting journals, to keep the process methodologically reliable and scientifically
consistent. The researchers review the main databases for educational technology
to ensure all related journals of the field are included. This review is only focused
on journals to keep the scope of the review manageable and provide reviewed data
to create a resource for future studies.

Journals in which to base this literature review are listed in Table 2.

Supplementary procedures

Relevant papers were initially identified through traditional searches of online databases
and journals. These papers were subsequently analyzed to determine their applicability
to the study.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Four phases were determined to meet the paper’s inclusion criteria in the final set to be
reviewed. First phase was initial search, searching each term ‘personalized learning,’
‘adaptive learning,’ ‘individualized instruction,’ ‘customized learning,’ filtered years to
2010-2020 to review personalized learning papers which has been a hot topic for the
research and policymakers. The language was filtered to English only to not wait on
translation, the paper addressed technology integration, and type of the paper re-
search articles that published in one of the peer-reviewed scientific journals listed
to keep the scope manageable. The second search phase was eliminating by title,
reviewing the abstract and keywords; researchers went through titles, abstracts, and
keywords of each result of the initial search and included the ones look related to
the term.

The next search phase, reading the abstract of each paper of the second search
result-set, looking for a definition to see if it mentions the definition and/or terms that
have been used for the term and the paper was available at one of the free online data-
bases or the researchers’ university library. The fourth step was to download all those
papers to Mendeley (indexing database) and index them under sub-folders for each
journal database. Then the entire paper was read to determine if the paper was to be
included in the literature review by looking for components and definitions of personal-
ized learning and star the ones to be included in the review. Each paper that met the
inclusion criteria was read in its entirety a second time to validate the paper’s decision
in the final data set.

An initial search on google scholar on ‘personalized learning’ shows that the number
of published papers on personalized learning has progressively increased year by year;
especially there is a jump in 2008 as seen in Fig. 1. The date range of 2010 to the
present day was chosen as this when personalized learning term started to gain
more attention to research due to technology usage increase in education. The first
smartphone was released in June 2007, which might be an element of the increase
due to flexibility and access it provides. Cheung and Hew (2009) claimed that
handheld devices are increasingly being used in educational settings. Primarily, pa-
pers published after the 2000s are focused on more _ technology-enhanced

personalized learning. Figure 1 shows the results of the initial google scholar search
on “personalized learning” published papers (Fig. 1).

Results
Nine journals were determined as the source of papers to be reviewed for this study.

ndividual-
ized instruction,” “customized learning,” and each result gone through the inclusion cri-
teria and final phase; papers were saved in Mendeley under subfolders for each journal.
Table 3 are search results for each phase by journals.

The title, abstract, and when necessary, the full paper was reviewed to decide if the
paper met the inclusion criteria. This process helped to finalize the papers that will be
used for this study, and the result set for “personalized learning” and the result set for
each term to be reviewed is shown in Table 3. Some of the papers that did not fit the
inclusion criteria are referenced in this paper as they provide valuable information
about personalized learning. We reviewed 978 papers, and 4 phases of inclusion ended
up with 56 relevant, high-quality papers. The 56 papers identified are marked in the
references section with an asterisk. The systematic review methodology was used, and
our literature search resulted in 56 relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria. As
shown in Table 4, 56 papers met the minimum quality criteria and were examined in
detail; 33 of them use personalized learning, 17 adaptive learning, three individualized
instruction, and three customized learning as the main term in the paper.

Our findings revealed that although so many terms are used in education settings, by
policymakers and cooperate settings, in the research field, the terms used for personal-
ized learning are unified, and mostly personalized learning and/or adaptive learning is
being used. For example, Chatti et al. (2010) and Peng, Ma and Spector (2019) are the

studies. However, future research needs to focus on components included in the per-
sonalized adaptive learning term’s definition, and components are included in it. Chatti
et al. (2010) and Peng et al. (2019) s paper put all together very well, and Peng et al.
(2019) called it a personalized adaptive smart learning environment. Future studies can
focus on what components are being used for each personalized learning approach and,
at the same time, acknowledge it is a term that will evolve by time as we learn more
about human learning and as technology develop. Table 4 shows the results of the

searches for each term by journals.

Existing and emerging trends

Miliband (2006, as cited in Schmid & Petko, 2019) pointed out that the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD (2006) was among the first to use
personalized learning term and described personalized learning in the report “Schooling
for Tomorrow- Personalising Education” as a critical trend. According to this educa-
tional policy report, personalized learning is characterized by changes concerning five
dimensions: assessment for learning by giving students individual feedback and setting
suitable learning objectives, teaching and learning strategies based on the individual
needs, curriculum choices (Tomberg et al., 2013), student-centered approach to school
organization, and strong partnerships beyond the school.

According to the United States National Education Technology Plan 2017, personal-
ized learning is defined as “instruction in which the pace of learning and the instruc-
tional approach are optimized for each learner’s needs. Learning objectives,
instructional strategies, and instructional content (Shute and Rahimi, 2017) may differ
depending on learner needs. Besides, learning activities are meaningful and relevant to
learners, driven by their interests, and often self-initiated.” (p. 9).

American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Psychology in Educa-
tion (1993, as cited in Lee et al., 2018) explained that a personalized learning plan
(PLP) refers to a customized instructional plan that considers individual differences or
needs such as career goals, characteristics, interests, and academic mastery. This
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 13 of 20

includes the notions of individualization, differentiation, and personalization. Preparing
and implementing PLPs allows for adjusting the pace to individual learners, adjusting
instructional methods to individual characteristics, and having different learning goals
tailored to individual interests. Furthermore, Sungkur, Antoaroo and Beeharry (2016)
suggested an eye-tracking system to determine the user’s interest and behavior. The
PLPs allow learning to be personally relevant, engaging, appropriate to the learners’
capabilities, and respectful of individual differences, making learning useful and
motivational.

Learning analytics seems to grow to ensure the process of personalizing the content
which allows mechanisms to identify student characteristics and associate them with a
learning pattern (Ramos de Melo et al., 2014). Also, the ability to reactively organize
personalized content may be a favorable factor in promoting the study support in vir-
tual learning environments, respecting students’ different individualities, preferences
(Eriimit and Cetin, 2020) and difficulty factors.

There is a research gap in an adaptive learning environment that needs to focus on
emotions and personality which play a significant role in parts of adaptive systems, such
as feedback (Fatahi, 2019). Furthermore, Junokas, Lindgren, Kang and Morphew (2018)
created a system based on multimodal educational environments that integrate gesture-
recognition systems and found that it is effective in improving the learning experience.

The personalization of learning has been achieved using various methods that have
been made available by the rapid development of information communication technol-
ogy (ICT) (Dawson, Heathcote and Poole, 2010). Furthermore, Ramos de Melo et al.
(2014) stated that personalization is customizing the content that allows present parts
of the content as needed by the student. That is one of the most common themes
among most of the personalized learning approaches which can be done by using adap-
tive learning systems that can present personalized content for individual students
(Hwang, Sung, Hung and Huang, 2013).

The higher-order thinking skills and communication had attracted little attention in
terms of both learning outcomes and the process of adaptive/personalized learning due
to the difficulty of measurement and the limited learning support types. Furthermore,
virtual reality techniques might be a solution to this need. Developing learning ap-
proaches that build on students’ current ability and support efficacy beliefs by allowing
autonomy with a proper challenge to promote academic attainment (Foshee, Elliott and
Atkinson, 2016; Xie et al., 2019). Future studies can focus on higher-order thinking

skills cultivation by supporting these skills through personalized learning environments.

Discussion

The idea of personalized learning rests on the foundation that humans learn through
experience and by constructing knowledge. It is heavily influenced by a learner’s prior
experiences and is accomplished via language and social interaction. Personalized learn-
ing is not the only way to think about teaching and learning. Moreover, learning will
and should take many different forms. Proper instruction, blended instruction, differen-
tiation, proactive supports, real-world connections, and applications are hallmarks of
good, sound personalized learning. In general, personalized-learning models seek to
adapt to the pace of learning and the instructional strategies, content and activities be-
ing used to fit best each learner’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Personalized
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 14 of 20

learning is about giving students control over their learning, differentiating instruction
for each child, and providing real-time feedback. Putting a framework together can help
with practical personalized learning for all and can be developed as it faces challenges.
The framework can help with having a structured common-sense personalized learning
instead of a learning system that is being interpreted differently. In conjunction with a
well-designed curriculum, instructional practice plays a crucial role in how children
learn.

Most of the current personalized learning models/ideas are built on technology
integration. For example, while Chen, Lee and Chen (2005) proposed a personal-
ized system that provides learning paths (Nabizadeh, Goncalves, Gama, Jorge and
Rafsanjani, 2020) that can be adapted to various levels of difficulty of course mate-
rials (Zou and Xie, 2018) and various abilities of learners (p. 239). Klasnja-Milicevi¢
et al. (2011) stated that personalized learning occurs when e-learning systems make
deliberate efforts to design educational experiences (Flores, Ari, Inan and Arslan-
Ari, 2012) that fit the needs, goals, talents, motivations, and interests of their
learners (p. 885). The term of needs is not specified to clarify what needs of the
learner need to be considered for robust personalized learning. Considering the
needs of the learner is one of the most common components used in personalized
learning. However, only a few studies clarify what needs are mentioned to be con-
sidered, such as emotional needs, social needs, learning needs, knowledge needs,
etc. Even if we agree on a unified definition with each component commonly
agreed on, we need to ensure that each component is well defined.

In the past decades, many methods and systems have been proposed to accom-
modate students’ needs by proposing learning environments that consider per-
sonal factors. Learning styles (Cakiroglu, 2014; KlaSnja-Milicevi¢ et al., 2011;
Latham, Crockett and McLean, 2014) have been among the broadly chosen com-
ponents in previous studies as a reference for adapting learning. For example,
George and Lal (2019) argued that personalized learning is meant to incorporate
a learner’s varied attributes, including learning style, knowledge level on a subject,
preferences, and learner’s prior knowledge while they discussed adaptive learning
is adapting content according to learner’s choice and pace. Chen, Huang, Shih
and Chang (2016) brought up the gender component to personalized learning.
Furthermore, Atkinson (2006) found that there was a significant difference in
learning achievement between male and female students, and among students
who used different learning styles (Cakiroglu, 2014; Klasnja-Milicevic et al., 2011;
Latham et al., 2014).

Our findings revealed that individualized instruction mostly focuses on special educa-
tion students or students are limited in way compared to their peers. These students
have IEPs (individualized educational plans) mandated by the state to be followed to
ensure the schools are accommodating these students’ needs. One goal could be to cre-
ate IEPs for all learners.

Moreover, it seems in education industry terms are quite varied, but when it comes
to academia, it is mostly adaptive learning and personalized learning being used inter-
changeably Rastegarmoghadam and Ziarati (2017); however, mostly adaptive learning is
being used when it is technology-enhanced learning. Adaptivity is typically referring to
content being adjusted according to prior knowledge (Huang and Shiu, 2012), while
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 15 of 20

personalized learning is being used for more broad adjustments according to different
needs, interests, and goals of individuals.

Another finding is that adaptive learning is the most used term follows personalized
learning. Individualized learning and customized learning, even though they are being
used by cooperative, they are not commonly used in research. As shown in Table 4, we
have found 56 papers met the minimum quality criteria and were examined in detail;
33 of them use personalized learning, 17 adaptive learning, three individualized instruc-
tion, and three customized learning.

However, it seems that also the lack of a commonly identified personalized learning
approach is an obstacle. This might be due to the nature of technology involvement;
due to the rapid development increase in technology that makes personalized learning
an evolving approach. That is fine if we all can agree that it should evolve as technology
improves, and we learn more about humans and how human-machine interaction can
improve the learning process.

Besides, another obstacle is the researchers and policymakers should show the
same interest to personalized learning so the demand and research can align. Edu-
cators fear that machines will take over the teaching job if they allow technology
to be used for teaching. Kinshuk, Huang, Sampson and Chen (2013) argued that
the benefits of technology in education caught the interest of researchers, govern-
ments, and funding agencies. Computer systems were funded to help students in
the learning process, consequently decreasing teachers’ workload. As a result, edu-
cational technology research was able to study advanced issues such as intelligent
tutoring, simulations, advanced learning management systems, automatic assess-
ment systems, and adaptive systems. Some educators believe that since technology
involves big budgets, the interest of policymakers is not due to the interest of im-
proving learning experience (Troussas, Krouska and Sgouropoulou, 2020); their
interest is due to the monetary benefit they gain from increased use of technology
in education. In addition, Kinshuk et al. (2013) pointed out that practitioners in
education could not take advantage of all that research at an equally fast pace, and
the implementation lagged severely behind. Researchers need to keep up with the
demand of personalized learning. The alignment will help to ensure the practices
policy makers discuss are research based efficient approaches that will increase effi-
ciency of learning/teaching.

The progress of the research in personalized learning shows that by technological im-
provement, personalized learning becomes more embedded with technology and taking
advantage of the benefits technology can offer. Some of these advantages are gathering
data of learners’ emotions by using bio-trackers, which might bring up some privacy

concerns.

Limitations

This study encountered several shortcomings during the review and in its attempt to
answer all the research questions. The enormous number of published papers might
lead to some missing relevant papers; numerous literature review studies face this prob-
lem. Furthermore, the immense effort to construct a search by identifying the keywords
is crucial for the search process. The keyword determination method was conducted
using a snowballing process to identify the reflections or keywords relevant to this
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 16 of 20

study. Overlooking articles by omitting relevant information or keyword combinations
is likewise possible due to the limited time frame.

Nevertheless, this study also faces the possible limitation caused by the selection cri-
teria. For example, this study focused on only journal articles and was limited to only
documents written in English. Therefore, other pertinent articles that are not written in

English and were not published in journals might have not included.

Future research

Our findings revealed that there is no unified agreement on what components to con-
sider planning a personalized adaptive learning environment. Future research can focus
on components included in different personalized adaptive learning systems and the
term’s definition to build a unified approach and definition. Future studies focusing on
what components are being used for each personalized learning approach simultan-
eously need to acknowledge it as a term that will evolve by time as we learn more about
human psychology and develop more technologies. Chatti et al. (2010) and Peng et al.
(2019) paper put it all together very well, and Peng et al. (2019) called it a personalized
adaptive learning. Future studies can be built on this approach to develop a general
framework.

Also, a focus on higher-order thinking skills is not a common theme in the existing
literature. This gap can be filled up by focusing on higher-order thinking skills cultiva-
tion by supporting these skills through personalized learning environments. Future
studies can also focus on adding higher-order thinking skills as an outcome of person-
alized learning models and seek embedding of virtual reality techniques with consider-
ing ethical and privacy concerns.

Furthermore, a in depth study is needed to review current personalized adaptive
learning platforms/systems and see if different systems work better for different goals
and needs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study found and analyzed 56 relevant studies based on the research
protocol. The findings from this study support that adaptive/personalized learning has
become a fundamental learning paradigm in the research community of educational
technologies. Firstly, the findings are presented as they relate to the R.Q. (Research
Question) s; then, the future direction and limitations are discussed. The SLR results
show that using personality traits and their identification techniques has an enormously
positive influence in adaptive learning environments. This study is related to several
significant domains of psychology, education, and computer science. It likewise reveals
the integration of personal traits in the adaptive learning environment, which involves
many personality traits and identification techniques that can influence learning. Also,
it found that there is an increase of interest in two areas that are oriented towards the
incorporation and exploration of significant data capabilities in education: Educational
Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) and their respective communities
(Papamitsiou and Economides, 2014) which seems to adding another perspective to
personalized learning and make it easier modify the learning according individuals.

It seems the personalized learning models gain more attention from governments

and policymakers than educators and researchers. We need to focus on the obstacles of
Shemshack and Spector Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:33 Page 17 of 20

lack of interest to motivate the educators and researchers, the experts of the field, to
voice their concerns and look for solutions to come up with a robust personalized
learning model that will satisfy both instructor and learners’ expectations. Personalized
learning cannot be a solution to learning until it is defined better and developed more
thoroughly. Personalized learning for everyone looks different according to the needs
and goals of the individual. Ennouamani, Mahani and Akharraz (2020) argued that
learners are different in terms of their needs, knowledge, personality, behavior (Pliakos
et al., 2019) preferences, learning style, culture, as well as the parameters of the mobile
devices that they use. Furthermore, the increasing involvement of the researchers and
educators in proposing personalized learning approaches can increase the trust towards
the ICT supported personalized learning models.

In this review study, we have answered some critical research questions, including
the issues with different terms that have been used for personalized learning, compo-
nents of personalized learning, and obstacles to the development of personalized learn-
ing. We need more research to be done about personalized learning. We also need the
involvement of experts in the field, educators, pedagogues, researchers, software engi-
neers, and programmers to create teams to work on the same goal to produce stable,
unified, personalized learning systems/models.

Also, some research issues and potential future development directions are discussed.
According to the discussions and results, it was found that adaptive/personalized learn-
ing systems seem to evolve as technology develops, however, a unified agreement on
the components needs to be included in personalized learning models still needed.
These components may evolve as we learn more about human-machine interaction and
learn to take advantage of the technology to improve learning experiences. We suggest
that researchers might use the consolidated terms of this review to guide future meta-
analyses of the impact of personalized learning on student learning and performance.

To sum up, this study discusses the potential obstacles to personalized learning and
practical solutions for these issues. We also discussed different components used for
personalized learning models and how personalized learning evolves as technology de-

velops, and we learn more about human-machine interaction.
