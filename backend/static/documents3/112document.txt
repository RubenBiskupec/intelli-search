Abstract

Background: Medication is an important approach of treatment for patients with schizophrenia; however, the avail-
ability of visiting nurses and other human-related support is limited. This study aims to build a system in which service
robots support the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia with medication at home. Moreover, medical staff can
seamlessly monitor the status of their patients through the robots using this system. In this study, to develop a sup-
port system, interactions between a communication robot and patients were surveyed, with a focus on the patients’

impression of the robot and actual utterance times.

Methods: Communication between a commercially available communication robot and schizophrenic patients
was investigated, particularly the participants’ feelings about the robot. In addition, the utterance data between the
participants and the robot were extracted and the durations of the conversations were assessed.

Results: The examined interaction mode of a robot (talkative or not talkative) and whether the participant spoke

or not (spoke or did not speak) revealed no significant association in all adjectives. A co-occurrence network graph
showed differences in the participants’ impressions of the robot depending on how talkative the robot was. That is,
when the robot did not initiate conversation often, the patient was more likely to initiate interactions and use longer
phrases than when the robot initiated conversation frequently. Conversations also lasted longer when the participant,

not the robot, initiated conversation.

Conclusions: People with schizophrenia converse with a robot regardless of whether the robot is talkative or not.
Since the content of the conversation was not analyzed qualitatively, it is necessary to carefully examine whether
people with schizophrenia can develop partnerships with robots.

Background

Service robots that can interact with people are expected
to help patients with their daily routines despite short-
ages of medical and nursing caregivers [1, 2].

Service robots are expected to not only work for
humans but also serve as their partners. PARO, a men-
tal commitment robot, provides psychological care to
elderly individuals through robotic therapy [3]. Similarly,

AIBO, a robot pet, provides companionship to single
people, which creates a sense of attachment [4]. When
service robots are recognized as partners, they may be
able to provide psychological encouragement.

Service robots may be able to support medication
management, because long-term medication treatment
requires psychological support for the patient. Such sup-
port from robots, called medication adherence, is effec-
tive because it raises the patient’s willingness to take their
medication by emphasizing the importance of doing so
[5, 6]. World Health Organization (WHO) has shown
the importance of improving medication adherence to
support medication treatment [7]. Therefore, it is prefer-
able to avoid ordering patients to take their medication

according to dosage schedules [8]. Rather, it is desirable
to provide support via companionship so that schizo-
phrenic patients can improve their lives independently
[9].

Many of the existing medication support technologies
have a fixed installation location and an LCD display or
alarm that alerts the user when it is time to drink the
medicine [10, 11]. A smartphone-based system, designed
to improve medication adherence, provides support with
a medication time alarm and self-monitoring function
on an operation screen composed of letters and buttons
[12]. Conversely, visual agents that display animations
of human faces on desktop computers, and build social
relationships through dialogue increase the satisfaction
of schizophrenic patients when completing self-report-
ing tasks [13]. According to a survey by the Consumer
Affairs Agency, only 40% of Japanese psychiatric patients
(including schizophrenic patients) use the Internet for
shopping, etc., which is less compared to healthy indi-
viduals [14]. Schizophrenic patients living alone in rural
areas have difficulty using smartphones and PCs. There-
fore, it is necessary to consider the usability of non-verbal
methods other than textual information in consideration
of cognitive decline in schizophrenic patients. In addi-
tion, it is effective for the robot to have an appearance
that enables social interaction that is considered to be
effective for improving medication adherence, and have
a function that helps to build a relationship between the
patient and robot.

Medication treatment is important for individuals
with schizophrenia, but nurses that visit the patient at
their home and other human support is limited. When
a patient’s motivation is low, their reducing nodding and
answering impede their social relationships [15]. Visiting
nurses and families understand the status of people with
schizophrenia and help to improve their medical adher-
ence by speaking to them appropriately [16]. To similarly
support schizophrenic patients, it is necessary for robots
to understand a patient’s characteristics and have a trust-
ing relationship that allows the patient to recognize a
robot as a partner. A study on the relationship between
schizophrenic patients and humanoid robots showed that
the facial expressions of robots could convey emotions
[17]. However, there are few studies on the interaction
between schizophrenic patients and robots. Therefore,
to develop support service robots for people with schiz-
ophrenia, it is necessary to investigate how the patients
communicate with robots.

In contrast, multiple investigations related to the
mechanisms by which healthy individuals interact with
robots has been conducted in recent years [18]. Interac-
tions with store sales robots using appropriate conver-
sation participation models have performed well [19]. A

talkative robot that actively greeted users made the users
feel welcome [20]. In conversations with robots, voice
recognition technology is identified as a social entity
more than touch-based technology [21]. It is necessary to
study effective technical approaches, such as interactive
design and speech recognition, based on the characteris-
tics of schizophrenia to build partnerships between these
robots and healthy people.

This study aims to use robot communication technol-
ogy that enables the robots to talk positively with patients
with schizophrenia in the physical world and support
them through communication so they can reliably take
their medication at home. The goal is to build a system
that allows schizophrenic patients to be treated at home
with the support of robots, through which medical and
nursing staff can seamlessly monitor the patient’s status
(see Fig. 1). Medication support robots for schizophrenic
patients are being developed through collaboration with
experts in psychiatric nursing who are familiar with the
work of visiting nurses, robotics experts who have devel-
oped medical and welfare robots, and cognitive science
experts who can conduct examinations and analyses
of user-centered design. In this paper, we report how
humanoid communication robots, which were intended
to prompt social interaction, were accepted by schizo-
phrenic patients using a basic survey that was focused on
the patients’ impressions and actual utterance times. To
examine how well schizophrenic patients accepted com-
munication with the robots, we investigated the relation-
ship between the degree of a robot's talkativeness and
the patient’s impression of it, as well as the relationship
between the duration of conversations and whether the
patient or robot initiated them.

This study was approved by the Medical Review Board
of Gifu University of Medical Science (2018.11.30, No.
30-11) and the three psychiatric daycare centers that par-
ticipated in the investigation. All participants and their
support staff at the daycare facilities gave oral informed
consent before participation. The author explained to
the participants that they were free to participate or not,
and that they would not suffer any disadvantages by not
participating. The author also explained that both the
contents of the impression survey questionnaire and the
voice data recorded would be anonymized prior to data
analysis. In addition, the participants were informed that
their submission of the completed questionnaire consti-
tuted their consent to participate in the study.

reported their opinion when they first met the robot.
In addition, data from the voice recordings of the con-
versations between the participant and the robot were
extracted and their durations were recorded. In mental
health, nursing, and welfare studies, it is important to
analyze interviews and statement records to document
the situation and characteristics of the subjects. There-
fore, utterance data, which is observational data, was col-
lected and its contents were verified.

Communication robot

The communication robots used in this study were pro-
gramed with input from three psychiatric nursing spe-
cialists familiar with the three daycare facilities involved
in the investigation, robotics specialists with medical
robot development experience, and cognitive science
specialists with mental health and welfare research expe-
rience. The three following conditions were confirmed by
the committee members. First, the robot communicated
in Japanese, which was the participants’ native language.
Second, a chat function was provided as standard. ‘Third,
it was ensured that there was a well-established record
of welfare facilities, which were used to ensure safety. A
humanoid communication robot that met these condi-
tions was selected from products currently available in
Japan.

The PALRO (Fujisoft Co., Ltd.), which has been widely
used in communication support for elderly welfare facili-
ties in Japan, was selected (see Fig. 2) [22, 23]. PALRO isa
small robot approximately 40 cm tall and weighs approxi-
mately 1.8 kg. It uses open architecture, general-purpose
products and is equipped with communication and

autonomous movement functions, such as human emo-
tions and learning (speech recognition/speech synthesis/
motion detection/personal recognition/face recognition,
etc.). Table 1 shows the communication functions that are
standard in PALRO. The PALRO has a switch that allows
the user to control the number of possible communica-
tions when it recognizes that there are people around the
user. Bickmore et al. [13] presented visual agents that dis-
play animations of human faces on desktop computers
and build social relationships for schizophrenic patients.
Considering cognitive decline in schizophrenic patients,
it might be more appropriate to provide audio informa-
tion in addition to the visual information. In this survey,
we used two levels of interaction settings “not talkative”
in which the PALRO does not speak, and “talkative” in
which the PALRO speaks often, and examined whether
there were changes in participants’ impressions and con-
versation time depending on the amount of talking. This
communication function allows the user to select from
two levels of “talkative” mode, that increases the number
of speaking actions when it recognizes that there is a per-
son around; the “not talkative’ mode reduces the number
of actions.

Impression survey

Kanda et al. [24] performed a seven-step evaluation of
the impression of the robot using the structure design
method using a set of 28 adjective pairs. However, in
the opinion of psychiatric nursing specialists and cogni-
tive science experts, it was possible that number might
be burdensome for our schizophrenic participants
to perform. The adjective “wise” was also considered

potentially difficult for our participants because it was
determined that it might cause delusion and anxiety.
Therefore, we selected adjectives that were applica-
ble to the communication robot from the 27 positive
expression words of the adjective pair excluding “wise”
(kind, likable, familiar, safe, warm, cute, relaxing, com-
prehensible, casual, light, helpful, natural, full, excit-
ing, pleasant, favorite, interesting, good, complex, fast,
quick, chaotic, active, strong, ebullient, fun, and sensi-
tive). Additionally, we provided a simplified version if
the participant had any other impressions (see Fig. 3).
Participants observed the communication robot, and
they were able to describe it freely and submit the
questionnaire survey whenever they finished answer-
ing it. The impression survey was a simplified version
that excluded negative adjective choices and elements;

therefore, it might not have been possible to collect a
fair and subjective impression of the robot.

In addition, the participants were asked to write down
how they felt about the robot. These comments were sta-
tistically analyzed with a KH-coder [25]. At the end of the
questionnaire, the participant chose the words provided
to describe the robot and answered questions if they had
spoken to the robot. If the participant said that they had
not spoken to the robot, they were asked why not.

Utterance survey

Concerning the utterance data, while setting up PALRO
for questionnaire surveys asking participants for their
impressions, only the audio data were recorded to check
whether the communication robot and _ participants
were communicating. The conversation between the
Ozeki et al. Robomech J (2020) 7:13

participant and the communication robot was recorded,
and the continued conversation was extracted. The data
collected by the voice recorder were anonymized for eth-
ical considerations. We prepared data from the extracted
data, in the frequency band of 200-2000Hz, from the par-
ticipants at one facility over 10 days (interaction mode:
talkative 5 days/not talkative 5 days), excluding the data
from the first day, when the interviewers informed the
participants about the survey.

The utterances determined suitable for the purpose of
this survey were extracted, anonymized, and arranged
as a transcript. An analysis was conducted using a modi-
fied version of the grounded theory approach (M-GTA),
which is a mainstream analysis method in psychiatric
nursing research, as a guideline [26, 27]. However, con-
versations that were judged to contain inappropriate
content related to personal information and medical con-
ditions were excluded.

Participants providing impression and utterance data

The participants were schizophrenia patients who
attended a psychiatric daycare facility in Gifu Prefec-
ture. The participants were recruited by word of mouth
at the facility. Only participants who agreed to cooperate
were given the questionnaire for the impression survey.
Table 2 shows the information the participants provided
on the questionnaire; they submitted 127 completed
surveys. However, since the participants were allowed
to submit completed surveys multiple times during the
implementation period, there may have been dupli-
cate submissions. The proportion of participants by age

Page 5 of 14

showed no significant differences in a comparison with
Japanese schizophrenic patients during outpatient treat-
ment, although the proportion of those aged 20-39 was
almost twice as that of outpatients.

In the utterance survey, the conversations between
the communication robot and each participant were
recorded using a voice recorder, but no individual was
identified for ethical considerations. Though recording
was performed at three facilities, we decided to use data
from only one facility because the recording conditions
were the best at this facility. Table 3 shows the recording
and utterance times. A statistical power analysis to deter-
mine the necessary sample size was conducted using
G*Power [28]. We opted for an effect size estimate of
f = .25, which is a medium effect according to Cohen’s
conventions [29]. ‘The power and alpha error levels were
set to 1 — 8 = .80 anda = .05, respectively. To identify a
possible significance in an ANOVA (fixed effect, special,
main effect, and interactions), G*Power indicated a mini-
mum total sample size of 128.

Measurements

In the impression survey, incomplete data such as
incomplete/unfilled questionnaires were excluded
from the collected data forms. Whether a participant
talked with the robot was noted, and the set of adjec-
tives that the participant had selected was collected.
The questionnaire also collected the data of age and
gender. Kanda et al. [24] collected participants’ experi-
ence such as watching movies about robots and play-
ing with robot toys and revealed that those activities

influenced their impressions. The experience of inter-
action with robots may different depending on age and
gender. Therefore, this study also examines whether
there is a relationship between demographics and
impression reporting.

In the utterance survey, we noted whether it was the
participant or the robot that initiated the conversation.
A conversation was considered to occur if the speaker
alternated between robot and participant with no more
than a 5-second gap. The utterances were counted and
their durations were measured.

Procedure

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether
a communication robot can function to support
improved medication adherence through social inter-
action. In order to promote social interaction, it is
desirable that communication robots not be regarded
as unilateral information providers, but as peers with
social cognition with whom schizophrenics may want
to engage. Therefore, we assessed whether schizophren-
ics would show interest in communication robots. To
record the natural conversation with schizophrenic
patients, the authors put the robot in a public space of
daycare facility.

A communication robot was installed at a psychiat-
ric daycare facility in Gifu Prefecture. Participants were
provided with an environment where they could freely
interact with the robot. They participated arbitrarily in
impression surveys using questionnaires and speech
surveys. The survey was conducted from February 2019
to July 2019 at monthly intervals at three psychiatric
daycare facilities. In all facilities, the communication
robot was introduced during a morning meeting on
the first day of PALRO installation, and both the par-
ticipants and staff were informed of the survey method.
In the first week, PARLO was set up in the “talka-
tive” interaction mode (i.e., the robot spoke often) or
in a “not talkative” mode, in which the robot rarely
spoke. In the second week, the interviewers distrib-
uted an impression survey questionnaire after remov-
ing PALRO. In the third week, PALRO was set up in the
opposite interaction mode (“not talkative” if “talkative”
was used in the first week and vice versa). In the fourth
week, an impression survey questionnaire was con-
ducted without PALRO.

When we introduced PALRO to our users, we used
the popular “Please sing some song” communication
function. During the installation period, a sheet outlin-
ing the contents of Table 1 enclosed with PALRO was
posted for guidance. Experimenters and staff did not
guide patients to talk to PALRO.

Results

Impression survey

A total of one-hundred and twenty-seven single-sheet
completed questionnaires were collected at the three
facilities. Of those, 16 incomplete sheets were excluded
from the analysis, and 29 sheets on which participants
answered “I don't feel anything” for the question about
the robot’s presence were also excluded from the analy-
sis. Another 9 sheets were excluded because the partici-
pants had not answered whether they had spoken with
the robot or not, as those sheets would have reduced the
accuracy of the answer. Therefore, 73 sheets were ana-
lyzed, as shown in Table 4.

Figure 4 shows the adjectives the participants used
to describe their feelings about the robot. A chi-square
test was performed on four groups of answers, divided
by interaction mode (talkative or not) and whether the
participant spoke to the robot or not (spoke or did not
speak). No significant association was found for any of
the adjectives. Therefore, the interaction mode of the
robot, and whether or not the participant spoke to the
robot was not related to a participant’s impression of
the robot. A regression analysis was performed to deter-
mine whether participants’ gender, age, and the “talka-
tive / not talkative” robot condition were related to the
selected impression. We found that the selection of “cute”
was related to lower age groups (p < 0.1), while “casual”
was related to whether or not the robot was talkative
(p < 0.1). “Sensitive” was statistically significant, with
male participants selecting this descriptive when the
robot was talkative (p < 0.001).

The comments provided by the participants in the
empty text box were converted into text data. Breakdown
of the free description answers analyzed and found as 156
sentences in “talkative” The total number of extracted
words were 618 words from 156 sentences (242 words
(hereafter the number of words used in analysis are in
parentheses)), and the number of types of words 232 (146
words). In the category “not-talkative’, 208 sentences
were analyzed and the total number of extracted words
was 1170 words (457), and the number of types of words
was 342 (237).

The text data on the impression of the robot were
statistically processed using KH-Coder. Figure 5 is a
co-occurrence network graph based on the text data
collected in talkative mode, and Fig. 6 is that for the

not-talkative mode. Since the collected comments had
many short sentences, only responses consisting of at
least three words were analyzed. In order to search for
patterns in word-to-word connections, graphing was
performed by subgraph detection (mediation) using
color-coded groups. The co-occurrence network graph
confirmed a difference in the descriptive reporting, with
not-talkative mode being more connected to words and
groupings than talkative mode. Figure 5 shows that the
Jaccard coefficient representing the mean degree of asso-
ciation between the extracted characters was 0.09, and
the displayed graph had a light degree of association. On
the other hand, in Fig. 6, the Jaccard coefficient was 0.25,
and the displayed graph had a mid-degree of association.
There were five color-coded groups in Fig. 5 and six in
Fig. 6. Therefore, not-talkative had stronger ties between
words than talkative, and slightly more groups of co-
occurring words, confirming that there may be a differ-
ence in the descriptive reporting of impressions.

Utterance survey

Table 5 shows the number of utterances and conversa-
tions of every speaker. A chi-square test for independence
indicated no significant association between the type of
speaker and the interaction concerning the number of
utterances (x7(1) = 2.87,p > .05). Further, it indicated
a significant association between the type of speaker
and the interaction mode of the robot concerning the
amount of conversations (y7(1) = 7.81,p < .01). Conse-
quently, it was shown that the interaction mode affected
whether the participant or the robot was more likely to
initiate conversation. Figure 7 summarizes the amount
of conversation depending on the interaction mode and
the speaker. When the interaction mode was not talka-
tive, the fewer conversations occurred, indicating that the
interaction mode of the robot affects the initiation of the
conversation. On the other hand, the participants had the
same number of conversations regardless of the interac-
tion mode of the robot; hence, the interaction mode did
not affected the likelihood of the participant initiating
conversation.

Figure 8 shows the means and standard deviations
of the robot’s and the participants’ conversations. A
two-way 2 (interaction mode: talkative, not talkative;
within-participants) x 2 (type of speaker: Robot, Partici-
pants; within-participants) ANOVA was applied. This
revealed a significant main effect of the type of speaker,
(F (1,332) = 6.91,p < 01,5 = .02,1— 6 =.76), _ indi-
cating that conversations lasted significantly longer
when the robot spoke for longer periods of time than the
participant.

cialists in transcripts were performed from a minimum

of 1 turn to a maximum of 39 turns in a single dialogue.
When a conversation between a communication robot
and a participant made one turn, the average was 7.9
while the median was found as 6 turns.

The verbal transcripts created from the collected utter-
ance data were classified into topics based on the con-
tent and conclusions of the utterances in a process called
open coding in the M-GTA, and finally 88 concepts were
generated. Next, these concepts were summarized into
13 categories as shown in Table 6 through axial coding,
which organized the phenomena that occurred in conver-
sation. In this categorization, to examine how much the
communication functions of PALRO shown in Table 1
were used, even if the number of concepts was small,
they were left as categories without being aggregated.
The eight of the twelve functions presented in the manual
as communication functions were used: No. 2, No. 5, No.
6, No. 7, No. 8, No. 10, No. 11, and No. 12 in Table 6.

Of the 88 concepts, 39 were O—5 turns below the
median, and 49 were over 6 turns, indicating that some
conversations involved the patient waiting for a response.
Some conversations with over 6 turns involved negative
utterances (“It’s irritating”), and many positive utterances
(“Ah, PALRO. Can you talk about something?”) could also
be interpreted from the script. The free description of
the paper questionnaire survey included comments such
as “I was happy to come to the day care and talk to the
robot” Some participants reported that PALRO was wel-
comed as a conversation partner.

Discussion

The investigation of the robot's degree of talkativeness
and the opinions of the schizophrenic patients indicated
no relationship between the talkativeness of the robot
and the impression felt. However, the statistical process-
ing of comments gathered in the questionnaire revealed

that, when the robot was not talkative, in the co-occur-
rence network more complicated words were formed.
Conversations lasted longer when the robot initiated
them. However, the robot’s interaction mode was not
related to the establishment or length of the conversation.
The results suggest that people with schizophrenia par-
ticipate in conversations regardless of the talkativeness of

the communication robot. Since the content of the con-
versation was not analyzed quantitatively, it is necessary
to carefully examine whether individuals with schizo-
phrenia are able to form partnerships with robots.

In an experiment with healthy people, participants
evaluated several models of interaction and decided
that the best model was based on interaction with a

shopkeeper [19]. A robot that greeted customers actively,
gave the participants an outgoing and friendly impression
[20]. These results suggest that a robot that implements
an interaction design tailored to the target and context
could change people’s impression of the interaction.
Our results did not show evidence that schizophrenia
affects the impression of whether the robot’s interac-
tion mode is talkative or not. Participants in the present
study may have found it difficult to obtain an impression
about, or relate to the robot based on its talkativeness.
However, the complexity of the co-occurrence network
graph obtained from the questionnaire did depend on
the robot’s interaction mode. To make a communication
robot that has been evaluated by schizophrenic patients,
it would be necessary to study more interaction designs
and models that promote natural conversation based on
the characteristics of schizophrenic patients. It is also
necessary to analyze how visiting nurses interact with
schizophrenic patients [16].

Healthy young people reported feeling friendly with
robots in conversations based on speech recognition
[21]. Bickmore et al. [13] showed that visual agents that
display animations of human faces had an influence on
schizophrenic patients’ satisfaction. However, “not-talk-
ative” condition complicated the free description of the
questionnaire. In addition, the younger schizophrenic
participants had the impression that PALRO was “cute”.
Additionally, schizophrenic participants felt “active”
impression in “talkative” condition and male participants
reported impression of “sensitive” in particular. These
suggest that the attributes and experiences of schizo-
phrenic participants might have an influence on their
impression. In addition, Kanda et al. [24] showed that
participants’ experience had influenced their impres-
sions for robot’s behavior. PALRO used in this study has
physical pose and behavior reminding human move-
ment (bowing, turning the face in the direction of peo-
ple, dancing, etc.) that were originally incorporated in

the automatic control. These physical pose and behavior
might have affected participants’ impression more than
PALRO’s speech. In experiments with schizophrenic
patients and humanoid robots, the robot's facial expres-
sions successfully conveyed emotions [17]. People with
schizophrenia responded faster with negative facial
expressions than with positive facial expressions. How-
ever, it has been reported from a comparative analysis
of healthy people that it is harder for a robot to convey
emotions via facial expression than for a human to do so.
In addition, schizophrenic patients tend not to function
well in social interactions if their symptoms are negative
[15]. The communication robot employed in this study
can recognize speech, however, its facial expressions
are not similar to that of humans, unlike the case with
humanoid-type robots (for example, PALRO does not
have eyebrows, eyes, a nose, or a mouth). The schizo-
phrenic patients who participated in the survey were
patients at mental daycare facilities and were not person-
ally identified. The participants’ symptoms were relatively
stable but not uniform. Therefore, it is necessary to scru-
tinize an effective approach to schizophrenic features and
to know a patient’s symptoms in real time.

The establishment of a conversation between a schizo-
phrenic person and the robot improved when it was the
robot that initiated the conversation. The robot used in
the present research was effective in communication care
for people with dementia in Japan [23]. Therefore, there
is a possibility that the effect of initiating conversation
with dementia patients would be similar as that of the
people with schizophrenia. That possibility could not be
evaluated in this survey, however, PALRO may be a suit-
able robot for such an evaluation.

Finally, this study had several limitations. No relation-
ship was found between the patients’ impression of the
robot and speaking as interaction. However, the more
people who reported that they did not feel anything about
the presence of the robot were excluded from the analy-
sis data for the not-talkative condition than for the talka-
tive condition (see Table 7). The chi-square test showed
a significant relationship between interaction mode and
feeling the robot’s presence (x7(1) = 8.54,p < 01).
In other words, there is a possibility that the degree of
talkativeness was related to whether the robot made an
impression on the participant. Therefore, it is necessary

not feel anything about the robot

to consider a different approach than the one taken
in this study in order to explore the factors related to
impression. Moreover, for speech analysis, the contents
of speech and conversation were not analyzed. There-
fore, we did not sufficiently examine the social interac-
tion between the patients and the robot. It is also possible
that a lack of social interaction with the robot prevented
the patients from forming a relevant impression about
the robot. It will also be necessary to further examine
whether the content of the conversation with the robot
was appropriate for schizophrenic patients. For that rea-
son, it is necessary to scrutinize the contents of utter-
ances, however, this must be done with a great care.

Conclusions

In this study, we investigated the impressions and utter-
ances between schizophrenic patients and communica-
tion robots. In summary, more than two-thirds of the
daycare facility users participated in the impression sur-
vey using the free participation questionnaire, and we
obtained the patients’ opinions about the communica-
tion robots. During the installation period, conversations
occurred daily between the participants and the commu-
nication robot. Among these, half of the dialogs, which
were analyzed and arranged in transcripts, were conver-
sations of six or more turns, and there were some events
that could be interpreted as the patient considering the
communication robot as a conversation partner. In addi-
tion, there were no complaints or cancellations from
users or daycare facility staff during the experiment, and
no direct denials claiming harm or damage by the com-
munication robot. Therefore, we considered that even in
the living environment of the schizophrenic patients who
participated, they did not feel a sense of rejection and
considered themselves to have been accepted, and it was
observed that social interaction could occur. The patients
conversed with the robot, and did so regardless of the
robot’s talkativeness. When the robot was not talkative,
schizophrenic patients initiated conversation with the
robot about twice as often as the robot did.

For future research, it will be necessary to examine in
detail how the amount of conversations from the com-
munication robot affected schizophrenic patients from
the viewpoint of user-centered design. In this study,
some of the utterances that could not be recorded in the
script were derived from the symptoms of schizophrenic
patients, so it will be necessary to establish a system that
can respond to such data and conduct a resurvey. At that
time, a survey method using video data will be needed to
capture the characteristics of body motion. To improve
medication adherence, which was the purpose of this
study, and develop a robot that can support schizo-
phrenic patients in their daily lives, it will be necessary
Ozeki et al. Robomech J (2020) 7:13

to further explore the characteristics of social interac-
tions of schizophrenic patients. We believe that study-
ing an interaction model based on the characteristics of
schizophrenia during the patients’ daily life will lead to
a better understanding of schizophrenia and its various
symptoms, and will contribute towards improved home
medical care for people.

Finally, in terms of the limitations of this study, the data
may be biased because the questionnaire survey had only
127 participants, and the utterance data was as low as
63 times for approximately 170 users. At some facilities,
there were participants who could not talk to the robots
due to the daily schedule of recreation and outings, so
it will be necessary to consider the installation method
and period of studies. In addition, many of the schizo-
phrenic participants who participated this time are liv-
ing with relatively stable symptoms, so it is highly likely
that the survey results show only a part of the overall
effect of schizophrenia. It will be necessary to continue
the research to establish the relationship between schizo-
phrenic patients and communication robots compared to
other research in the field of mental health.
