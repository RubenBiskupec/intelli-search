ABSTRACT

Based on the International Electrotechnical Commission — standards,
the electronic devices in the industrial class (e.g., integrated circuits or
batteries) can only operate at the ambient temperature between -40°C and
85°C. For the human-involved regions in Alaska, Northern Canada, and
Antarctica, extreme cold condition as low as -55°C might affect sensing
electronic devices utilized in the scientific or industrial applications. In this
paper, we propose a design and optimization methodology for the self-
heating portable enclosures, which can warm up the inner space from -55°C
for encasing the low-cost industrial-class electronic devices instead of
expensive military-class ones to work reliably within their allowed operating
temperature limit. Among the other options, ceramic thermal resistors are
selected as the heating elements inside the enclosure. The placement of
the thermal resistors is studied with the aid of thermal modelling for
the single heating device by using the curve fitting technique to achieve
uniform temperature distribution within the enclosure. To maintain the inner
temperature above -40°C but with the least power consumption from
the thermal resistors, we have developed a control system based on the fuzzy
logic controller. For validation, we have utilized COMSOL Multiphysics
software and then one prototyped enclosure along with the fuzzy control
system. Our experimental measurement exhibits its efficacy compared to
the other design options.

1. INTRODUCTION

An important factor for the normal operation of electronic devices is their ambient temperature.
Low temperature may change the property of material and then vary the electrical resistivity. The resistivity
of intrinsic semiconductor materials increases at a lower temperature, while extrinsic semiconductor
materials have more complicated temperature profiles. As a result, any change in the ambient temperature
can cause variations in threshold voltage, saturation velocity, and carrier mobility of aMOSFET [1, 2].

Kumar and Kursun showed that the propagation delay of various logic gates increased up to 19.6%
in 180nm CMOS technology and 54.5% in 65nm CMOS technology when the temperature rose from 25°C to
125°C [3]. To address the thermophysical effects of the state-of-the-art three-dimensional integrated circuits
(ICs), comprehensive analysis and optimization of the critical structures including die, device layer, heat
sink, and heat spreader were conducted in [4]. On the other hand, when the temperature is very low,
semiconductors would turn to insulators, which do not feature conductance any longer. Therefore, ICs must

be warmed up first to allow bandgap voltage references to boot. Keane et al. claimed that low temperature
of -50°C or below might terminate the normal operation of switches, relays, ICs, and other part of electrical
equipment [5]. They suggested that electronic devices should work at the temperature of -25°C or above if no
heating unit is used.

Based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, the electronic devices in
the industrial/commercial class can only operate at the temperature between -40°C and 85°C. If any
electronic device has to work below such an allowed temperature range, there may be the following two
options. The first countermeasure is to use military-class electronic devices, which are normally highly
expensive. As a second choice, a heating method has to be deployed to warm up the local surroundings of
ICs or batteries to above -40°C if the ambient temperature stays lower.

In the recent years, many new methods have been introduced for warming up batteries. Ji and Wang
compared different schemes (such as internal heating, external heating, and convection heating) in terms of
warm-up time, capacity loss, system durability, cost, and lifetime [6]. They showed that the heating time
could be significantly shortened with those methods especially when reducing cell output voltage. They also
claimed that the battery capacity loss was around 5% if using the high-efficiency heating method. Later
Wang et al., proposed a new lithium-ion battery structure for self-heating to address its power loss in cold
climates [7]. This mechanism can internally warm up battery to work normally within 20 seconds at -20°C
and 30 seconds at -30°C. More recently, Guo et al., proposed an electro-thermal coupled model-based
computational method for accurately estimating the battery thermal behavior [8]. It has the potential of
balancing heat generation rate and battery lifetime degradation for reaching the optimal preheating
performance. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, thus far there is no reported work in the literature
that can sustainably warm up any industrial/commercial-class electronic devices working in the extremely
cold polar environment.

Different from classical or digital logic operating on discrete values (either 0 or 1), a fuzzy control
system is based on fuzzy logic by analyzing continuous analog input values in terms of logical variables
between 0 and 1. By providing a means of converting linguistic control strategies, the fuzzy logic control
method is especially suitable for the systems, which cannot be easily mathematically modeled [9]. The fuzzy
logic controller (FLC) consists of four components: fuzzification interface, knowledge base, inference
engine, and a defuzzification interface [10]. Each of these components has a different role in the control
process and thus affects the performance of the whole system. In [11], Parsi et al., proposed a FLC
to accurately control temperature in a cost-effective disposable off-chip micro-dispenser. A Peltier
thermoelectric device supported by the FLC can warm up or cool down liquid for droplet transportation in
the nL range, along with an electromagnetic actuator.

In this paper, we propose a design methodology of external portable structures (called enclosures
hereafter) in the extremely cold environment (up to -55°C) to warm up any internal industrial-class
low-power electronic systems, which may consist of ICs, sensors, and batteries normally operating at
the temperature between -40°C and 85°C [12-14]. For choosing the external heating sources, ceramic heating
elements are studied both by using COMSOL Multiphysics software and experimentally [15, 16]. We have
also developed a control system based on fuzzy logic to control inner temperature and reduce power
consumption.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the design constraints and optimization strategies
for the type, number, location/style, and placement of heating elements will be studied. An analytic modeling
method will be presented in section 3 to simplify the enclosure design procedure. Our proposed fuzzy
logic controller will be discussed as well. In section 4 we will report our experimental results. Finally,
the conclusion is drawn in section 5.

2. STUDY OF HEATING ELEMENTS

In general, there are various electrical devices that can be used as electric heaters. Some of these
heating devices in the industrial/commercial applications include incandescent light bulbs, thermal resistors,
and thermoelectric devices. In this research, energy conversion efficiency, simplicity, and low cost are
the major criteria that we have applied in the component selection.

An incandescent light bulb normally converts less than 5% of the energy into visible light. A study
has shown that this number for a standard light bulb is only about 2.2%, while 97.8% of the energy is
actually converted to heat [17]. That is to say, the incandescent light bulb may be used as a fair heat source.
Another source of heat is the ceramic heating elements, e.g., ceramic thermal resistors that are both simple
and inexpensive widely available in the typical electrical laboratories. Each ceramic thermal resistor is made
of a small cylinder of graphite, surrounded by a protective ceramic layer. Short wires, or leads, are attached
to both ends of the graphite cylinder and held in place by the coating material. A thermoelectric device,

Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708 O 6253

as the third type of electric heating elements, can actually offer more functions. In contrast to
the incandescent light bulbs and ceramic heating elements, its main advantage is that the low-temperature
surface would absorb heat and the high-temperature surface would release heat when electrical current passes
through the device in the opposite directions. If the direction of the electrical current changes, the hot and
cold surfaces would actually interchange [18]. In other words, the direction of heat dissipation is completely
reversible so that a heating device can be changed to a cooling device if the polarity changes.

The main purpose of this study is to design cost-effective enclosures for polar environmental
conditions. In this regard, an inexpensive electric heater has to be selected. In general, the cost of
a thermoelectric device is 35 times more than that of a thermal resistor, while an incandescent light bulb is
within the same price range as a thermal resistor. In a demonstrative experiment, we conducted finite element
method (FEM) simulation to compare the efficiency of the ceramic thermal resistor unit and the incandescent
light bulb unit under the same conditions (i.e., the same total power consumption for both heating units in
addition to the same environmental condition such as the same initial temperature -55°C and the same
surroundings). According to our experiment, the ceramic thermal resistor unit could heat up the enclosure
more quickly than the incandescent light bulb unit if energizing both units with the same amount of power.
As a result, the ceramic thermal resistors, as a better option in terms of heating efficiency, simplicity, and
cost, are selected as the heating elements in this work.

Besides the type of the heating elements, the number and placement of the thermal resistors have to
be also studied. The placement study is to identify the best location and define the constraints for orientating
the heating elements to warm up any enclosure with the best thermal effect. Below our study will be mainly
focused on three aspects: the number of the heating elements, the location/style of the heating elements, and
the placement constraints [19].

First of all, we conduct several FEM simulations to study whether one single or multiple heating
elements (given the identical electrical power) would lead to better thermal effect. This case study is based on
an enclosure with the dimension of 10 cm*10 cm*10 cm (for width, length, and height, respectively).
In addition, an insulated boundary condition is added to the FEM model to decrease the heat flux leakage to
the ambient, whose temperature is set as -55 °C constant. Moreover, constant heat sources are added to
the model. The initial ambient and inside temperature of the enclosure is -55 °C. Upon the initial conditions,
the simulation is set to run 150 minutes.

By assuming constant total power consumption, a comparison between the heating efficiency and
the number of the deployed thermal resistors is studied. The temperature average and standard deviation are
listed in Table 1. As can be observed from the table, the enclosure inner space cannot be warmed up
uniformly if using too fewer thermal resistors. But when five 1 W thermal resistors are used, the average inner
space temperature reaches —33.37°C, which is less than 0.2% compared to that achieved by the four 1.25W
thermal resistors. Meanwhile adding one more thermal resistor would incur more cost in addition to more
space. As a result, a placement of four thermal resistors along each side is the best arrangement for uniformly
warming up the inner space of the enclosure in this case study.

Another important issue for the heating element placement is to understand the constraints with
reference to the electronic devices accommodated in the 3D enclosure. A 2D analysis shows that the best
location of the heating elements is along the sides, while in the 3D model the heating elements may be placed
on the top, bottom, or in the middle of the enclosure. Therefore, another group of simulation is executed to
find out the effective distance from a thermal resistor. The effective distance stands for the distance
from a unit power thermal resistor that can warm up the surrounding operational elements (e.g., printed
circuit boards or batteries) without causing damage. By using curve fitting technique [20, 21], the best
approximation of a linear model based on a series of sampled data points can be obtained. As can be seen in
Figure 1(a), the radial effective distance d,, (i.e., the vertical one in the 2D view) and axial effective distance
da (i.e., the horizontal one in the 2D view) for heating up the surrounding objects are between zone 2 and
zone 5 (i.e.,1/9 < d, < 1/2.3 and w/6.4 < d, < w/1.6 where | and w are the thermal resistor device length
and width respectively on the facing side). The root mean square (RMS) error is also listed in Figure 1(a).
As a result, the best place of locating a thermal resistor unit is in the middle since it can distribute the heat in
both directions.

Another point that can be observed from Figure 1(a) is that the operational elements must not be
placed in zone | (1.e., very close to or overlapping with the heating elements), which has the highest
temperature compared to the other zones. Instead they should be located within the effective distance with
reference to the thermal resistor that is located in the middle of Figure 1(a). The enclosure inner space
should be warmed up uniformly. Otherwise, uneven warmup may cause serious damage due to the thermal
stress that would be applied to the internal printed circuit boards or batteries accommodated inside
the enclosure. Certain cracks might be propagated along the electronic devices to eventually cause open
circuit problems [22].

The heating conduction along the radius of thermal resistors’ carbon cylinder, which eventually
leads to the radial effective distance as shown in Figure I(a), is much more than the axial one because of
larger surface contact with the coating layer. As a result, the area determined by the effective distance in
Figure 1(a) has an approximately rectangle shape instead of a square one. Figure 1(b) shows the average
temperature of 18 sampling points inside zones 1-6 in the 3D model of the enclosure as a function of time.
The points, which are selected at 1/9 <d,<1/2.3 and w/6.4<d, <w/1.6 (i.e., within zones 2-5),
have an average temperature above -40°C at the steady state (1.e., after passing the first 150 minutes),
whereas the points located elsewhere are either too cold or unnecessarily too warm. In addition, we conduct
another group of FEM simulation to study whether the size of the enclosure may change the effective
distance of one-unit thermal resistor. We deploy two-unit thermal resistors in two different size enclosures
with the same environmental condition, each of which consumes the same electrical power. Our study shows
that the effective distances of two thermal resistors bear no change from each other due to the enclosure
size change.

3. ANALYTIC MODELING AND FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER

The case-study tactics and design knowledge accumulated from the previous section are highly
valuable in the practical design process so that the designers can work out a specific enclosure design without
any further expensive FEM simulations once the thermal modeling of the unit thermal resistor is completed.
Therefore, here we aim to optimize the number of thermal units to reduce power consumption and hardware
cost, in addition to increasing the available space for holding more electronic components inside
the enclosure. To reach this objective, we are motivated to study how to model the relationship between
the required power and the number of unit thermal resistors in the optimization process with a constraint of
maintaining the average inner temperature of the enclosure above -40°C in the polar environment. Note that
such a threshold temperature of -40°C can be changed to another user-defined number as long as the thermal
modeling of the unit thermal resistor is conducted in advance accordingly. Based on the concept of effective
distance supported by the curve fitting technique detailed in Section 2, we propose a general analytic design
methodology as follows, with which the designers can quickly estimate the required power and thermal
resistor number for heating up the enclosure to above -40°C without any expensive FEM simulations.
Figure 2(a) shows the schematic view of the enclosure with unit thermal resistors in the row-based
configuration, which is aimed for the enclosures with relatively larger geometry size (with reference to
the size of the unit thermal resistor). In contrast, Figure 2(b) shows the schematic view in the side-based
configuration, which is dedicated to the enclosures with smaller geometry size. Figure 2(c) depicts
the effective distance of each unit thermal resistor.

To establish the relationship between the number of unit thermal resistors and enclosure size,
we should formulate a set of analytic functions [23]. By considering the size limitation of the unit thermal

resistor in addition to the maximum effective distance of each thermal resistor, we have set up two different
models to identify the best location for orientating the heating elements to warm up the enclosure with
the best thermal effect. We have utilized a user-defined threshold value, which is equal to 2L, by default,
to determine which model should be selected. In other words, if each dimension of the enclosure is less than
2L,, the side-based configuration will be utilized so that each thermal resistor will be placed near each
side for warming up the inner space of the enclosure uniformly. Otherwise, the following functions will
be utilized:

A, = (W,-—2t)(L.—2t), A>, = (L, + 1.256W,)(W, + 0.869L,), A,=mA;, (1)

where W,. and L,. are the width and length of the enclosure, t is the thickness of the insulation layer, W,. and

L,. are the width and length of each unit thermal resistor respectively, and m is the number of the unit thermal
resistors in the 2D view of the enclosure.

inner temperature of the enclosure is always above -40°C, can be expressed as:

where Punit is the power of the unit thermal resistor. The estimation above would help a designer to evaluate
the number of the required thermal resistors and the corresponding required power without invoking any
expensive FEM simulations [24].

Autonomously controlling inner temperature of the enclosure is of importance in this research since
in the remote area the enclosures have to detect the ambient temperature and automatically tune their thermal
units. In this study, we have utilized the fuzzy logic control method for the temperature control of
the enclosures. In this regard, the required power that the thermal resistor units need to heat up the enclosure
is the input of our target system to be controlled, while the temperature that is read out by the temperature

sensors is the output of our target control system. Table 2 lists the rule base of our developed fuzzy logic
controller. The linguistic input terms include very negative, negative, zero, positive, very positive, while
the linguistic output variables include zero, very low, low, high, very high.

Controller Rule 4: If the temperature difference is positive, then the output power must be high
Controller Rule 5: If the temperature difference is very positive, then the output power must be very high

Figure 3(a) shows the input of the fuzzy sets, which is defined as the temperature difference between
the reference temperature (i1.e., -40°C) and the actual sampled temperature. Based on the input fuzzy terms,
our developed fuzzy control rule base can derive an appropriate output fuzzy set. Then a corresponding
power value can be generated as shown in Figure 3(b).

4. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION

By following the case study discussed in Section 2, we prototyped the enclosure with a 3D printer
(Formlabs Form 2SLA). Figure 4 shows this prototype, which is made of polycarbonate. To make sure that
our enclosure has the minimum heat flux leakage, we need to form proper insulation around the enclosure.
Among the different options, foam insulation has become the most widely used insulation method. In this
work, we select polyurethane (PU) foam as an insulation layer thanks to its low thermal conductivity and low

cost in addition to ease of processing. In this experiment, W., H,, and L, are all equal to 10 cm. In addition,
W,. and H,, are equal to 1 cm, while L, is equal to 4.5 cm. As a result, (L, — 2t) is equal to 8cm, which is less

than the threshold value of 2L, = 9cm. Thus, the side-based configuration was utilized. It means that each
thermal resistor is placed along each side of the enclosure.

 

Figure 4. Cold chamber setup and the enclosure prototype with an insulation layer

The enclosure was put into a cold chamber to have its ambient temperature of -55°C as shown in
Figure 4. Then the enclosure started to warm up and the inner temperature was recorded. To measure
the inner temperature of the enclosure, four temperature sensor DS18B20 (with a measurement range
of -55°C ~ +125°C featuring strong disturbance resistance and high precision) were utilized to measure
the average of the inner temperature inside the enclosure.

In order to maintain the average temperature of the enclosure at -40°C or above, our proposed fuzzy
control logic, which is detailed in Section 3, was utilized in our experiments. Figure 5(a) illustrates
the schematic of the close-loop testbench with our proposed fuzzy logic controller and enclosure prototype.
The reference temperature of the fuzzy logic controller was set as -40°C. Figure 5(b) shows the average
temperature of the enclosure prototype when the fuzzy logic controller with a digital filter was utilized.
As can be seen from this figure, the settling time slightly decreased and the actual average temperature was
securely bound to the reference temperature compared to the open-loop system as shown in Figure 1(b).
This shows the high performance of our proposed enclosure heating and control system, which can reach
the target temperature faster and then stays there with a smoother curve for saving energy.

To compare the efficiency of our proposed fuzzy logic controller with the other alternatives, we also
included state machine controller and PID controller in our experiments by using the same testbench shown
in Figure 5(a). Similar to the fuzzy logic controller, these two general controllers are widely utilized for
the systems, which cannot be readily mathematically expressed [25]. The state machine controller constructs
a reactive system, which consists of a finite number of states and changes states as per the given conditions.
We implemented it by defining two states and switching them upon a comparison between the sensed
temperature from the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the reference temperature (-40 °C). As for the PID
controller widely used in industrial control systems, a control loop mechanism is built up to employ feedback
for continuously modulated control. Normally the PID controller continuously calculates an error value as
the difference between a desired reference point and a measured process variable. It applies a correction
based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted by P, I, and D respectively just as the acronym
of the controller). In our implementation, three operators (1.e., proportional, integral, and derivative) are
defined to represent the modulated error between the sampled temperature from the DS18B20 temperature
sensor and the reference temperature.

Figure 6(a) shows the comparison among the state machine, PID, and our proposed fuzzy logic
controllers. As can be seen from this figure, the output from the fuzzy logic controller has the least oscillation
around the reference temperature since the output power can continuously change between 0 and 1.
In contrast, the state machine controller suffers large fluctuation (+0.26°C) around the reference temperature
of -40°C. This is mainly due to the simple control logic used in this controller. Although the PID controller
could work better than the state machine controller in terms of temperature smoothness segmentally,
the magnitude of the temperature rippling (+0.31°C) along the reference temperature was actually even
larger. As for our proposed fuzzy logic controller, the average oscillation around the reference temperature
(-40°C) was only +0.02°C.

To compare the power consumption, the outputs of the system for the state machine, PID, and fuzzy
logic controllers are plotted in Figure 6(b). To calculate the total power consumption within the unit time
(e.g., one hour), (6) is utilized and the results are summarized in Table 3. One can observe that, in the steady-
state period, the total power consumption of our proposed fuzzy logic controller system is 17.6% less than
the state machine controller and 38.04% less than the PID controller.

5. CONCLUSION

In this paper we presented a complete design methodology for cost-effective portable enclosures,
which can accommodate industrial-class electronic devices operating at the ambient temperature as low
as -55°C. Among the alternatives, we selected ceramic thermal resistors as the heating elements inside

the enclosure. Moreover, the optimal number, location/style, and the placement constraints of the heating
elements were studied. Based on the thermal modeling of the unit heating elements by using curve fitting
technique, we proposed an analytic model, which can be used to estimate the number of the required thermal
resistors or the total required power in the practical enclosure design. In addition, we developed a fuzzy logic
controller to manipulate the inner temperature of the enclosure. Our experimental results demonstrated
that the prototype enclosure with the proposed fuzzy logic controller can achieve excellent performance
compared to the other alternatives.
