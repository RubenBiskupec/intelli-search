Abstract

Digital technologies have changed the way supply chain operations are structured. In this article, we conduct
systematic syntheses of literature on the impact of new technologies on supply chains and the related cyber risks.
A taxonomic/cladistic approach is used for the evaluations of progress in the area of supply chain integration in the
Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, with a specific focus on the mitigation of cyber risks. An analytical
framework is presented, based on a critical assessment with respect to issues related to new types of cyber risk and
the integration of supply chains with new technologies. This paper identifies a dynamic and self-adapting supply

chain system supported with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and real-time intelligence for
predictive cyber risk analytics. The system is integrated into a cognition engine that enables predictive cyber risk
analytics with real-time intelligence from loT networks at the edge. This enhances capacities and assist in the
creation of a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and threats that arise when edge computing
nodes are deployed, and when AI/ML technologies are migrated to the periphery of lol networks.

Introduction

There are many businesses opportunities in networking
supply chains within the new digital economy (Bauer
et al. 2015). Smart manufacturing is set to create large
resource savings (G. Anderson 2016), and enable econ-
omies of scale (Brettel et al. 2016). The new paradigm of
Industry 4.0 (14.0) will enable organisations to meet indi-
vidual customer requirements and create value opportun-
ities (Lee et al. 2019b), increase resource productivity, and
provide flexibility in businesses processes (Hussain 2017).

To allow for this however, it requires integration of the
Industrial-Internet-of Things (IloT) theories, control of
physical systems, and modelling interaction between
humans and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) (Marwedel
and Engel 2016, Wang et al, 2015). Business and supply
chain models need to embrace the opportunities from 14.0
(Jazdi 2014; Wahlster et al. 2013), for enhancing and auto-
mating their businesses process decomposition and real-
world visibility. Real-time enabled CPS and IloT platforms
should represent the foundation for 14.0 businesses and
respective supply chain models (Marwedel and Engel
2016). The idea of 14.0 was introduced with the develop-
ment of IIoT and CPS (Ashton 2011; Gershenfeld 1999).
The IloT and CPS have sought to integrate the real and

virtual worlds together (Tan et al. 2008), promoting auto-
mation with real-time enabled platforms (Ringert et al.
2015).

Although there is a consensus on the value from em-
bracing the 14.0 (Shafiq et al. 2015), the impact of cyber
risk remains to be determined (Okutan et al. 2018).
There has been some advancements however with auto-
mation of vulnerability discovery (Y. Wang et al. 2019),
and ensuring data confidentiality and secure deletion
(Zhang et al. 2018). The IloT and Supply Chain
Management in 14.0 need to prepare for high-grade
digitisation of processes, smart manufacturing, and in-
ter-company connectivity (Miller et al. 2018). This re-
quires understanding of the relationship between
technological entrepreneurship and socio-economic
changes (L. Li 2017).

A key novelty of this study is the process of using loT
design principles, presented as a step-by-step transform-
ational roadmap. Technology road-mapping of informa-
tion and communication technologies (ICT) is present
in literature (Bloem da Silveira Junior et al. 2018). The
findings from this study are building upon previous
work on understanding the 14.0 trends for key smart
manufacturing technologies (Lu and Weng 2018), and
contribute for policy development.

The article builds upon existing studies on attack syn-
thesis and towards predictive cyber defence (Okutan and
Yang 2019) and graph-based visual analytics for cyber
threat intelligence (Bohm et al. 2018), but distinguishes
between ICT and IloT. This is considered as fundamen-
tal distinction for narrowing the research efforts on un-
derstanding how modern IIloT technological concepts
can be integrated in 14.0 supply chains.

We review how artificial intelligence and lIoT intro-
duce new challenges to privacy, security and resilience
of connected supply chain environments. This study
builds upon the FAIR institute (FAIR 2020) method-
ology by redefining the FAIR institute definition on ‘ex-
plicit’ risk management. The research focuses on how AI
methods can be used to increase or decrease the preci-
sion and scale of attacks, by automating aspects such as
intelligence gathering, target selection, and attack execu-
tion. The IoT devices built into digital supply chains
greatly increase the amount of data captured. This could
result in data leaks and significant privacy risks. While
this topic is widely debated, less research has been con-
ducted on how AI techniques and IoT devices could
strengthen and improve privacy and security of individ-
ual users.

The study explores this angle, with a ‘red team’ ap-
proach, where a group of experts proactively identifies
strengths and weaknesses in systems and organisations.
We design AI/ML enabled methods to test and improve
the resilience of loT smart supply chains. We look at the

challenges and potential for the use of privacy preserving
AI/ML methods in regulatory red teams, such towards
enabling data protection compliance. The paper builds
upon the foundation of existing knowledge developed
from three PETRAS projects (CRACS 2018; IAM 2018;
Radanliev et al. 2019b), but with a specific focus on Arti-
ficial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) in IoT
risk analytics. It benefits from the already established
strong transformative and impactful research knowledge,
but with a focus on the topic of securing the edge
through AI/ML real time analytics. To avoid overlapping
with earlier work, this article avoids many relevant areas
that have been addressed in the working papers and pro-
ject reports that can be found in pre-prints online
(Radanliev et al. 2019a; Radanliev et al. 2019c; Radanliev
et al. 2019a, 2019b, 2019c; Radanliev et al. 2019d; Radan-
liev et al. 2019a, 2019b, 2019c, 2019d, 2019e, 2019f,
2019g, 2019h, 2019i, 2019j, 2019k, 20191, 2019m, 2019n;

Radanliev et al. 2019a, Radanliev et al. 2019c; Radanliev
et al. 2019b). This working papers and project reports
work enabled the cognition engine to be developed,
tested and verified, though the active engagement with
the user community and through responding to the new
Internet of Things (IoT) risk and security developments
as they emerged during the research. The novelty of this
article is the relationship of this work to AI/ML and pre-
dictive analytics.

Motivation and methodology
A taxonomic approach is used for the evaluations of
progress in the area of supply chain integration in the
Industrial Internet of Things and the Industry 4.0, with a
specific focus on the mitigation of cyber risks. An analyt-
ical framework is presented, based on a critical assess-
ment with respect to issues related to new types of cyber
risk and the integration of supply chains in new tech-
nologies. The approach is used to develop a transform-
ational roadmap for the Industrial Internet of Things in
Industry 4.0 supply chains of Small and Medium Enter-
prises (SMEs). The literature review includes 173 aca-
demic and industry papers and compares the academic
literature with the established supply chain models.
Taxonomic review is used to synthesise existing aca-
demic and practical research. Subsequently, case study
research is applied to design a transformational road-
map. This is followed by the grounded theory method-
ology, to compound and generalise the findings into
analytical framework. This results in a new analytical
framework based, whereby articles are grouped followed
by a series of case studies and vignettes and a grounded
theory analysis.

The analytical framework drives the process of com-
pounding knowledge from existing supply chain models
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

and adapting the cumulative findings to the concept of
supply chains in Industry 4.0. The findings from this
study present a new approach for Small and Medium
Sized companies to transform their operations in the In-
dustrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. A supply
chain is a system for moving products from supplier to
customer and supply chain operational changes from
digital technologies would specifically affect the small
and medium sized companies (SMEs) because they lack
the expertise, know-how, experiences and technological
recourses of large enterprises (Petar Radanliev 2014). A
new approach for businesses and supply chain strategies
is needed for the SME’s to adapt to a changing environ-
ment. To build such approach, designing cases studies
(Blatter and Haverland 2012), with the ethnographic and
discourse approaches to technology use and technology
development is applied to the theory construction (Da-
vid 2005).

Our methodology
Methodologically, the article draws on a number of dif-
ferent sources and research methods, including a taxo-
nomic review as a discourse of literature (Paltridge
2017), case study research (Blatter and Haverland 2012)
including open and categorical coding, with discourse
analysis and grounded theory. These methods are used
in combination for conducting a systematic literature re-
view. The data and the findings are synthesised using
the grounded theory approach of categorising the emer-
ging concepts (Glaser and Strauss 1967). The case study
research was performed on five 14.0 national initiatives
and their technological trends in relation to IloT prod-
uct and services for a diverse set of industries. The di-
versity of the study participants represented in the
sample population, is analysed with reference to the ‘In-
dustry Classification Benchmark’ (FTSE Russell 2018) to
determine the industry representativeness in the selected
14.0 national initiatives and their technological trends.
To ensure validity of the conceptual system, the study
applied qualitative research techniques (Easterby-Smith
et al. 2002; Eriksson and Kovalainen 2008; Gummesson
2000), complimenting method for grounded theory
(Charmaz 2006), with open and categorical coding sub-
sequently (Goulding 2002). Discourse analysis is applied
to evaluate and interpret the connotation behind the ex-
plicitly stated approaches (Eriksson and Kovalainen
2008), along with tables of evidence (Eisenhardt 1989)
and conceptual maps (Miles et al. 1983).

technologies into their supply chain management; 2.4
defines how SME’s can integrate real-time HoT tech-
nologies into their supply chain management; and 2.5
how SME can integrate cyber recovery planning into
their supply chain management. Chapter 3 applies case
study and grounded theory to categorise the 14.0 design
principles. Chapter 4 presents the analytical framework
and a transformational roadmap for integrating SMEs
supply chains in the IloT and 14.0.

Taxonomic review

The literature review covers a vast area of internet-of-
things, cyber physical systems, industry 4.0, cyber secur-
ity, and supply chain topics, e.g. digitisation, automation
and autonomy. The literature review applies a taxonomic
approach and follows the process of synthesising the
most prominent categories, emerging from the reviewed
literature. This follows the grounded theory approach of
categorising emerging concepts (Glaser and Strauss
1967). The emerging categories from the review are clas-
sified with open and categorical coding (Goulding 2002)
in the theory development chapter.

The taxonomic review of early supply chain models
represents the foundation for our work on building the
theoretical approach for integrating SME’s in the
Internet-of-Things and Industry 4.0. The focus of this
review and the proposed approach is the Internet-of-
Things approach within Supply Chain Management.
Considering the vast literature on Supply Chain Man-
agement from decades of research, the review is focused
on the key areas instead of covering too many topics.
The review does not address the related areas of vertical
and horizontal integration, smart supply chains, and
supply chain visibility because that would represent too
many topics and thereby lead to losing focus. Instead,
the review applied presents an up-to-date literature re-
view and categorises the best practices, design principles,
common approaches, and standards affecting SME’s sup-
ply chains in 14.0. This was considered as a relevant fac-
tor as many published models might rather apply to big
corporations.

How to integrate existing supply chain models

Complexities remain in prioritising collective, as op-
posed to individual, performance improvement (Melnyk
et al. 2014), and strategies commonly apply limited mea-
surements (Van der Vaart and van Donk 2008). Holistic
design visualising how different types of integration cre-
ates different effects is proposed (Rosenzweig et al.
2003). Thus, a hierarchical method can be applied for
network design for deconstructing a complete supply
chain that separates between the businesses and supply
chain themes (Perez-Franco 2016). This approach has
never been applied for SME’s designing 14.0 supply
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

chains and its parameters will require altering to antici-
pate the similar and distinct features.

Following the taxonomic review method, the discourse
of literature with open and categorical coding for dis-
course analysis and grounded theory, short summary of
the areas is presented in the Table 1 outlining the design
process on how SME’s can integrate existing supply
chain models. Along with the underlying factors driving
the design (B. Lee et al. 2019b) in the digital age includ-
ing aligning strategy with digital technology; implemen-
tations of Internet-enabled collaborative e-supply-chains;
and integration of electronic supply chains. Table 1 de-
tails how to align and integrate existing supply chain
models.

How to integrate modern technological concepts in
supply chain management - technical challenges

The technical challenges for SME’s integrating modern
technological concepts, such as the 14.0 mostly evolve
around the design challenges and the potential economic
impact (loss) from cyber-attacks. But I4.0 also presents
technical challenges in supply chains design and re-
quires: software defined networks; software defined stor-
age; protocols and enterprise grade cloud hosting; AI,
machine learning, and data analytics; and mesh networks

and peer-to-peer connectivity. The integration of such
technologies in supply chains creates cyber security risk,
for example from integrating less secured systems. Inte-
grating the cyber element in manufacturing, also bring
an inherent cyber risk. There are multiple attempts in
literature where existing models are applied understand
the economic impact of cyber risk. But there is no direct
correlation between the higher cyber ranking and the in-
dustry application of digital infrastructure (Allen and
Hamilton 2014), thus challenges could be more related
to performance metrics for security operations (Agye-
pong et al. 2019).

How to integrate modern technological concepts into

Digital supply chains should counteract components
modified to enable a disruption. This could be supported
by standardisation of design (Nurse et al. 2017) but risk
assessing is still a key problem (Petar Radanliev et al.
2020). The reason for this is that digital cyber supply
chain networks need to be: secure, vigilant, resilient and
fully integrated (Craggs and Rashid 2017) and encom-
pass the security and privacy (Anthonysamy et al. 2017).

on how to integrate real-time IloT technologies in sup-
ply chain management.

How to integrate cyber recovery planning into supply
chain management

The 14.0 brings inherent cyber risks and digital supply
chains require cyber recovery plans supported with ma-
chine learning, enabling machines to perform autono-
mous decisions (Tanczer et al. 2018) and a design
support system (Lee et al. 2019a). To improve the re-
sponse and recovery planning, digital supply chains need
to be supported by feedback and control mechanisms,
supervisory control of actions (Safa et al. 2018). Most of
these recommendations also apply to large enterprises.
However, large enterprises have the recourses to control
the entire supply chain, while SME’s frequently have to
integrate their supply chain operations (Petar Radanliev
2015a, 2016). Integrating multiple SME’s in the supply
chain requires higher visibility and coordination between
participants (Petar Radanliev 2015b, 2015c).

Finally, the taxonomic review of literature and the ana-
lytical framework in Table 5 outlines a short summary
of the design process on how SME’s can integrate cyber
recovery planning into their supply chain management.

The key gaps in the literature emerging from the

literature which confirm that SMEs would benefit from
standardisation reference are:

e Existing 14.0 architectures, lack clarification on
designing individual components of 14.0 supply
chains.

e The SME's need to integrate cloud technologies in
their supply chains.

e The SME's digital supply chains need to encompass
the security and privacy, along with electronic and
physical security of real-time data.

e In the 14.0 supply chains, machines should connect
and exchange information through cyber network
and be capable of autonomous cognitive decisions.

e The SMEs need security measures to protect
themselves from a range of attacks in their supply
chains, while cyber attackers only need to identify
the weakest links.

e The weakness of existing cyber risk impact
assessment models is that the economic impact is
calculated on organisations stand-alone risk, ignor-
ing the impacts of sharing supply chain
infrastructure.

The literature reviewed lacks clarification on the re-
quired design principles to address these gaps in individ-
ual levels of the 14.0 supply chains. Without such
clarification, it is challenging to build a standardisation
reference. In addition, supply chains design is still domi-
nated by separation between established supply chain
models, and the evolution of the HoT. This separation is
likely caused by the development of many established
businesses and supply chain models before the rapid
emergence of the IloT.

Case study of five leading 14.0 technological
trends

The gaps and key factors in current technological trends
for 14.0 supply chain design integrating IloT principles
were derived from the taxonomic review. These are ana-
lysed through a case study of 14.0 frameworks in the
current chapter. The case study specifically addresses
the SME’s needs for 14.0 know-how and develops a
transformational roadmap of tasks and activities to reach
a specific target state for the SME’s supply chains. We
have chosen to use a case study research-based method-
ology because it is recommended in recent literature for
addressing the gaps in knowledge and for advancing the
methodological rigour; this is done specifically by study-
ing platforms on different architectural levels and in dif-
ferent industry settings (de Reuver et al. 2017).

The case study design compares individual problems
derived from the literature with the technological trends
in industry today. Comparative analysis is applied which
involves the five leading 14.0 initiatives and technological
trends. The comparative analysis is building upon previ-
ous work on a comparison of ‘Made in China 2025’ and
‘Industry 4.0’ (Li 2017), with an extended list of 14.0 ini-
tiatives. The justification for selecting the specific 14.0
initiatives was their richness in detail and explicitly
stated strategies. The case study research initially
reviewed 15 initiatives, worth mentioning, some coun-
tries have multiple 14.0 initiatives (e.g. USA, UK, Japan).
But not all initiatives are discussed in great detail, as
they lacked explicit details on 14.0 supply chains. The
initial list of 15 initiatives reviewed are included in
Table 6.

The initiatives and their technological trends reviewed,
embed the 14.0 and present a quick overview of the
current state of the 14.0 supply chain adoption. The case
study starts with the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC
2016), as the leading and most recent initiative, and fol-
lows with a case study of additional four 14.0 world lead-
ing initiatives.

The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) (IIC 2016,
2017) promotes a fully connected and automated pro-
duction line that brings the customer into the produc-
tion process as a decision-maker. IIC supports highly
automated (rules engines, protective overrides) and hu-
man operated (visualisation, intervention controls) usage
environments.

The UK 14.0 report (DCMS 2017) focuses extensively
on the cloud integration in 14.0. While some initiatives
are supported with direct examples of how the strategy
can be executed (e.g. cloud data centres: Amazon, IBM,
and Microsoft; or the cloud skills initiative to train pub-
lic service in digital skills for development of cloud tech-
nology skills), other initiatives are not well defined. For
example, the cloud-based software initiative states con-
tinuation towards common technology and lack a con-
crete action. This could in some instances be beneficial,
as loosely defined standards provide flexibility in evolv-
ing as requirements change. Nevertheless, a concrete
area of focus is required for the integration of SME’s
supply chains in 14.0. Another review report from the
UK (Siemens 2017) is focussed on industry rather than
commerce. The report estimates a £185 billion value in
the next 10 years from four sectors construction, food
and drink, pharmaceutical and aerospace sectors. The
review makes three main recommendations for 14.0:
adoption, innovation and leadership. While the value of
this review cannot be denied, the claim of focus on in-
dustry can rather be described as the areas where gov-
ernment funding can help the industry. By reviewing the
recommendations, it becomes clear that in each recom-
mended area, public funding is required for achieving
the goals. For example, the main areas (1) investing in a
‘National Adoption Program’; (2) launching new
innovation centres across the UK; (3) implementing
large-scale digital transformational demonstrator pro-
grams and (4) pushing research and development in the
identified areas; are all points that require public fund-
ing. Or the recommendation to up-skill a million indus-
trial workers, again requires government funding. Even
the seemingly leadership area of promoting the UK as a
global pioneer in industrial digital technologies, which
would fit in the government policy focus, is again con-
fused with government subsidies as it calls for setting up
a ‘campaign’, and setting up ‘support implementation
groups. The objective of this article is to identify and
categorise such policies and to present as industry led

Page 7 of 21

(and market focused) and not government led options
for the UK and any other government that is aiming on
developing their digital economies.

The most peculiar report is the Industrial Value Chain
Initiative (IVI) (IVI 2017). This 14.0 initiative, does not
report any plans for real-time embedded systems or re-
covery plans. It is difficult to accept that Japan would
miss out on these crucial principles for integrating HoT
in 14.0. It seems more likely that this initiative does not
state such principles clearly in their reports. Neverthe-
less, a detailed review of all reports on the IVI (IVI
2017) failed to identify any mentioning of real-time CPS
or recovery plans.

The German initiative, Industrie 4.0 (GTAI 2014;
Industrie 4.0 2017; Wahlster et al. 2013), covers the CPS
and IloT principles for cognitive evolution in 14.0. The
German 1.40 initiative promotes cloud computing inte-
gration with the Internet of Services, and proposes
cloud-based security networks. The initiative states that
automated real-time production is pioneered in
Germany, but it does not specify with specific examples
how real-time can be integrated in 14.0 and cognition is
only mentioned, but not applied. The main criticism for
Industrie 4.0 is that it does not state recovery plans.

In the case study, despite the lack of detail in the re-
quired categories, we include the Russian National Tech-
nology Initiative (NIT) (ASI 2016) because of its
significates in futuristic projections for 14.0 adoption.
NIT represents more of a long-term forecasting for 14.0.
The focus is on market network creations, and contrib-
utes with new insights to 14.0 by arguing that market
creation for new technologies is the key to the future
businesses and supply chain integration in 14.0. Similar
argument that value capture processes should be focused
on the ecosystem, is also present in literature (Metallo
et al. 2018). But the forecasting does not address the is-
sues of real-time cloud networks, and critically, does not
provide recovery planning.

Categorising the 14.0 design principles emerging from the
case study

These initiatives and their technological trends are ap-
plicable to SME’s and to large enterprises. To identify
the most prominent categories that apply to SME’s sup-
ply chains, the comparative analysis applied the
grounded theory approach to study and analyse the
emerging trends and to organise into related categories
and sub-categories. Through comparative analysis, a
number of shortcomings in individual initiatives are
identified. These shortcomings are addressed with the
grounded theory design process of sub-categorising to
the complimenting categories from the emerging 14.0
principles from the pre-selected 5 technological trends.
More complicated problems emerge when _ the
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

comparative analysis in Table 7 identifies that some of
the national strategies propose very different approaches.
The comparative analysis in Table 7 also identifies a
number of gaps in national initiatives. By gaps, we refer
to topics or a technological trends not incorporated in
the associated national initiative.

To resolve these gaps, individual areas are used as ref-
erence categories for building the analytical framework
(which is presented later in Fig. 3) that relates various
areas and eliminates conflicts in different and sometimes
contrasting 14.0 approaches. Following the grounded
theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 1967), the main
categories of each individual initiative are separated into
subcategories in Table 2 according to the gaps in their
design principles.

Analytical framework and a transformational
roadmap

The analytical framework development builds upon the
taxonomic review of literature and starts with organising
the most prominent categories of emerging approaches
in literature. This process of organising concepts into
categories, follows the grounded theory approach (Glaser
and Strauss 1967) and the open and categorical coding
approach (Goulding 2002). Discourse analysis is applied
to evaluate and interpret the meanings behind the cat-
egories (Eriksson and Kovalainen 2008), supported with

Table 7 Design principles emerging from the case study

Page 8 of 21

tables of evidence (Eisenhardt 1989) and conceptual dia-
grams (Miles et al. 1983) to present graphical analysis.
The methodological approach is described in more de-
tails in Chapter 3 and in this chapter is focused on enab-
ling SME’s practitioners to identify the value of the
proposed theoretical concept. The process of interpret-
ing the connotation behind the categories, the tables of
evidence and the conceptual diagrams are aimed specif-
ically to present methodological approach with graphical
analysis for SME’s practitioners, as they normally need
rather hands-on recommendations.

Pursuit of theoretical validity through case study research
In pursuit of theoretical validity, the methodological ap-
proach with graphical analysis was presented on the case
study group discussions with experts from industry. The
case study design primarily contributed to the process of
identifying a hierarchical organisation of the methodo-
logical approach.

The graphical analysis was used as a tool during the
group discussions to verify the themes, categories and
subcategories and their hierarchical relationships. The
group discussions included two different centres from
Fujitsu: Artificial Intelligence and Coelition; and four dif-
ferent Cisco research centres: First Centre: Security and
Trust Organisation, Second Centre: Advanced Services,
Third Centre: Security Business Group, Fourth Centre:

Cisco Research Centre. For the group discussion, the
study recruited 20 experts and distinguished engineers.
This approach to pursuing validity follows recommenda-
tion from existing literature on this topics (Axon et al.
2018; Eggenschwiler et al. 2016; Miller et al. 2018). The
methodological approach advances conceptual clarity
and provides clear definitions that specify the unit of
analysis for digital platforms. These are identified as rec-
ommended areas for further research in recent literature
(de Reuver et al. 2017).

Design principles for 14.0 supply chains

We place an emphasis on a cognitive 14.0 analytical frame-
work. A cognitive 14.0 framework refers to the trend of
automation, introduced by computing devices that are
reasoning and making supply chain decisions for humans.
The emerging applications and technologies are presented
in the form of a grouping diagram (Fig. 1) to visualise the
required concepts for the integration of SME’s supply
chains in 14.0.

The grouping of concepts starts with the most prom-
inent categories emerging from the taxonomy of litera-
ture: (1) self-maintaining machine connection for
acquiring data and selecting sensors; (2) self-awareness
algorithms for conversion of data into information

Page 9 of 21

(Ghirardello et al. 2018); (3) connecting machines to cre-
ate self-comparing cyber network that can predict future
machine behaviour (Anthi et al. 2018); (4) generates cog-
nitive knowledge of the system to self-predict and self-
optimise, before transferring knowledge to the user
(Madaan et al. 2018, 5) configuration feedback and
supervisory control from cyber space to physical space,
allowing machines to self-configure, self-organise and be
self-adaptive (J. Lee et al. 2015).

Following the methodology for reliable representation
of the data collected, open coding is applied (Goulding
2002) to the emerging categories for recovery planning
in Fig. 1. The conceptual diagram in Fig. 1 present
graphical analysis of the emerging design principles for
cognition in IloT digital supply chains. The emerging
design principles in the conceptual diagram, also address
the recommended gaps in recent literature on advancing
methodological rigour by employing design research and
visualisation techniques (de Reuver et al. 2017), such as
the graphical analysis in the figure. The elements in the
diagram emerge from the reviewed 14.0 technological
trends, national initiatives and frameworks reviewed
(Table 1) and the links between the elements emerge
from the design principles identified in the case study
(Table 2) for SME’s supply chains in 14.0.

Fig. 1 Iterative learning and improvement in design principles — synthesised from the taxonomic review
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

The findings in Fig. 1 present the first stage of design-
ing a dynamic and self-adapting system supported with
artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and
real-time intelligence for predictive cyber risk analytics
(PETRAS 2020).

The described principles represent the beginning of a
cognitive architecture for 14.0 supply chains. Such cogni-
tive architecture allows for learning algorithms and tech-
nologies to be changed quickly and re-used on different
platforms (Brettel et al. 2016; Niggemann et al. 2015),
for creating multi-vendor production systems (Weyer
et al. 2015) which is necessary for the 14.0 supply chains.
A cognitive production systems would provide real-time
synchronised coexistence of the virtual and physical di-
mensions (Shafiq et al. 2015).

The emergence of cognition, confirms that 14.0 supply
chain design requires multi-discipline testing and verifi-
cation (Balaji et al. 2015), including understanding of
system sociology (Dombrowski and Wagner 2014), be-
cause it operates in a similar method with social net-
works (Bauer et al. 2015; Wan et al. 2015). In the 14.0
supply chains, machines should connect and exchange
information through networks (Toro et al. 2015) provid-
ing optimised production and inventory management
(Lee et al. 2015; Wan et al. 2015; Weyer et al. 2015), and
CPS lean production (Kolberg and Ziihlke 2015).

Cognitive architecture principles for recovery planning in

14.0 supply chains

14.0 is expected to evolve from the traditional supply
chain network into digital supply chain networks (Taylor
et al. 2018). For digital supply chains to be considered
secure and to ensure digital recovery planning is ad-
equate, the supply chains need to be self-aware (Radan-
liev et al. 2019a, 2019b, 2019c, 2019d, 2019e, 2019f,
2019g, 2019h, 2019i, 2019j, 2019k, 20191, 2019m,
2019n), because a single failure could trigger a complex
cascading effect, creating wide-spread failure (Breza
et al. 2018).

Adding to this, distributed energy resource technolo-
gies such as wind power, create additional stress and
vulnerabilities (Ahmed et al. 2013; Marwedel and Engel
2016). To ensure supply chains to be considered secure
and to ensure digital recovery planning is adequate, ad-
vanced power electronics and energy storage are re-
quired for coordination and interactions (Leitéo et al.
2016; Marwedel and Engel 2016; Rajkumar et al. 2010),
as well as physical critical infrastructure with preventive
and self-correcting maintenance (Brettel et al. 2016; Lei-
tao et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2011).

Following the methodology for recognising the pro-
founder concepts in the data (Goulding 2002), categor-
ical coding is applied as a complimenting method for
grounded theory (Charmaz 2006) to compare the

Page 10 of 21

emerging categories for recovery planning with the cat-
egories in the taxonomic review. In this process, dis-
course analysis is applied to interpret the data (Eriksson
and Kovalainen 2008), behind the explicitly stated cat-
egories in the taxonomic review, resulting in explicitly
stated categories for recovery planning in Fig. 2. The
links between the elements in Fig. 2 emerge from apply-
ing the grounded theory approach to relate the findings
from the literature with the reviewed 14.0 technological
trends, national initiatives and frameworks reviewed
(Table 1) and the links between the elements as con-
firmed in the design principles (Table 7) and presented
in Fig. 1.

The conceptual diagram in Fig. 2 provides SME’s with
a bird’s eye view of an 14.0 target state for integrating
HoT in SME’s digital supply chains. The target state dia-
gram advances an earlier approaches (Shaw et al. 2004)
and presents the smart capability functions at a strategic,
business process and technical level. This presents the
second stage of designing a dynamic and self-adapting
system supported with artificial intelligence and Ma-
chine Learning (AI/ML) and real-time intelligence for
predictive cyber risk analytics (PETRAS 2020). This will
enhance capacities and assist in the creation of a com-
prehensive and systematic understanding of the oppor-
tunities and threats that arise when edge computing
nodes are deployed, and when AI/ML technologies are
migrated to the periphery of the internet and into local
IoT networks.

Challenges for IloT integration in industry 4.0 supply
chains

Apart from recovery planning, other challenges found in
literature for SME’s integration in Industry 4.0 supply
chains are:

a) robustness, safety, and security (Akinrolabu et al.
2019; Brass et al. 2018; Brass et al. 2019; Hahn et al.
2013; Nicolescu et al. 2018a; Zhu et al. 2011);

b) control and hybrid systems (Agyepong et al. 2019;
Leitao et al. 2016; Nurse et al. 2018; Shi et al. 2011);

c) computational abstractions (Ani et al. 2019;
Madakam et al. 2015; Radanliev et al. 2018b;
Rajkumar et al. 2010; Wahlster et al. 2013);

d) real-time embedded systems abstractions
(Ghirardello et al. 2018; Kang et al. 2012; Leitao
et al. 2016; Marwedel and Engel 2016; PETRAS
2020; Shi et al. 2011; Tan et al. 2008);

e) model-based development (Bhave et al. 2011; Jensen
et al. 2011; Rajkumar et al. 2010; Shi et al. 2011;
Taylor et al. 2018; Wahlster et al. 2013); and

f) education and training (Faller and Feldmiiller 2015;
Nicolescu et al. 2018b; Petar Radanliev et al. 2020;
Rajkumar et al. 2010; Wahlster et al. 2013).

These challenges present the difficulties SME’s face.
SME’s need protection across a range of new technolo-
gies, while attackers only need to identify the weak links
(Anthi et al. 2019; Van Kleek et al. 2018). This reempha-
sises the need for recovery plans, which is not explicitly
covered in the 14.0 initiates from the case study.

Future technologies for SME's integration in industry 4.0
supply chains

Finally, the SME’s need to plan for the adoption of fu-
ture technologies, to reduce cost and ensure compliance
with technological updates in their supply chain. Future
technologies include the deployment of self-sustaining
networked sensors (Rajkumar et al. 2010) and Cloud
centric supply chains (Gubbi et al. 2013), symbiotic with
the physical environment (Pan et al. 2015), creating eco-
industrial by-product synergies (Pan et al. 2015; Stock
and Seliger 2016). Such supply chains would be sup-
ported with  self-adapting distributed integrated-
decentralised architecture (Stojmenovic 2014; Wan et al.
2015), enabling applications to self-adjust and _ self-
optimise own performance (Brettel et al. 2016; Shafiq

et al. 2015). Where individual contract-based design is
applied before platform-based design (Sangiovanni-Vin-
centelli et al. 2012), enabling multiple models of compu-
tation to act as a single system (Benveniste et al. 2010;
Bhave et al. 2011).

Transformational roadmap for SME’s supply chain design
in 14.0

Here, we propose a transformational roadmap (Fig. 3),
where individual concepts describe larger blocks of the
14.0 supply chains. The design initiates with applying the
categories and sub-categories from the taxonomy and
the emerging standards from the case study that are af-
fecting SMEs supply chains in the 14.0 (Table 2). Then
applying the grounded theory approach and following
the recommendations from the literature reviewed, to
relate the most prominent categories and its related sub-
categories into conceptual diagrams. This design pro-
cesses integrates the categories and captures the best
practices in industry. This methodological design
process follows recommendations from literature (Stra-
der et al. 1999), and shows how individual components

can be integrated into an information infrastructure,
with the technologies that can fit within the proposed

The synthesised categories and sub-categories in the

the taxonomic review. For instance, the categories emer-
ging from the taxonomic review, and compounded to
address the identified gap, before being hierarchically
structured and organised in a step by step method. The

chain design decomposition, starting with a bird eye
view of the synthesised models on businesses and supply
chain design. Followed by the synthesised knowledge
from the taxonomic review and the case study, em-
bodied to SMEs supply chains in the 14.0. The trans-
formational roadmap design in Fig. 3 embodies a
process of ideas and concepts conceived as an interre-
lated, interworking set of objectives and applies directive,
conventional and summative analysis to relate the recov-
ery planning with the design categories. The
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

transformational roadmap design integrates the findings
from literature review on recovery planning, with the
findings from the case study and relates recovery plan-
ning with principles represented in the categories for
SME’s supply chain networks in 14.0.

The principles for SME’s supply chain networks in 14.0
supply chains are related to the findings and the gaps
identified in the taxonomic review of the earlier supply
chain integration models before 14.0. The findings are
specifically related to advancing and generalising the
previous case specific work on the implementations of
Internet-enabled collaborative e-supply-chain initiatives
(Pramatari et al. 2009) and integrated electronic supply
chains (Yen et al. 2004). Then the findings and the gaps
identified in the case study of the 14.0 initiatives and
their technological trends (e.g. that recovery plans are
not explicitly provided in such initiatives) are addressed
with specific action objectives from the taxonomic
review.

The logic behind the steps in Fig. 3 represents the
current understanding of the academic and industry pa-
pers and publications reviewed in this article. The choice
and sequence of steps is supported by the taxonomic re-
view in chapter 3 and the analysis of the 14.0 techno-
logical trends, national initiatives and frameworks in
chapter 4. The rationale as to why the particular steps
and their proposed sequence are chosen derive from the
design principles in Fig. 1 and the target state in Fig. 2.
In addition, the transformational roadmap in Fig. 3 en-
compasses material and understanding derived from re-
view and analysis of 173 academic and industry papers,
analysed with the grounded theory approach to ensure
the work is repeatable and is verified with the rigour of a
time tested and established method for conducting a sys-
tematic review of literature.

The transformational roadmap in Fig. 3 evaluates the
relationship between the IIoT technological trends and
derives with a process of digitalising SME’s supply chain.
The transformational roadmap recommends the devel-
opment of cognitive supply chain principles that enable
storing and sharing knowledge. This is of specific rele-
vance to SME’s because SMEs and large enterprises do
not have the same recourse and using existing know-
ledge enhances the 14.0 adaptation process in SME's.
Figure 3 presents the final stage of the conceptual de-
signing a dynamic and self-adapting system supported
with artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/
ML) and real-time intelligence for predictive cyber risk
analytics (PETRAS 2020). By integrating AI/ML in the
risk analytics, we devise a new approach for cognitive
data analytics, creating a stronger resilience of systems
through cognition in their physical, digital and social di-
mensions. It is expected that Web Science will be in-
creasingly more present in the physical world because of

Page 13 of 21

smart and connected devices (De Roure et al. 2019a,
2019b). Our approach resolves around understanding
how and when such connections causes compromises to
happen, and to enable systems to adapt and continue to
operate safely and securely when they have been com-
promised. Cognition through AI/ML is the key topic of
this research and cognitive real time intelligence would
enable systems to recover and become more robust.

The transformational roadmap structures the princi-
ples for recovery planning in SME’s digital supply chains.
The principles present the explicit relationships derived
from the taxonomies and the case study. The explicit re-
lationships between the principles for recovery planning
in cognitive IloT supply chain networks, enables the as-
sessment of individual technical risk for a given vulner-
ability. Through a visualisation of the explicit
relationships in digital SME’s supply chains, the tech-
nical risk for a given vulnerability can be better assessed,
e.g. by applying the Common Vulnerability Scoring Sys-
tem (CVSS) (CVSS 2019).

The analytical framework also considers the issues
with adoption, as it seems that in most of the reviewed
literature everyone tries to create their own model. The
taxonomic review and the case study identified the gaps
in existing models, and the transformational roadmap
made the solutions visible in an explicit format. The
transformational roadmap in this paper, however, is
dependent on given vulnerability being assessed by exist-
ing cyber risk assessment models (e.g. CVSS, 3.1) and
analysed with existing cyber risk analysis models (e.g.
FAIR-U tool). Hence, the analytical framework is pro-
moting the development of a generally accepted cyber
security framework; this is also called for in current re-
search work (FAIR 2020). The analytical framework rep-
resents a generic reusable approach, to be used by
SME’s for supply chain strategy development for 14.0 by
supply chain stakeholders and practitioners.

The analytical framework in Fig. 3 connects the supply
chains and the impact of cyber risk to human-computer
interactions in different supply chain management sys-
tems with artificial intelligence. This can provide supply
chain predictive feedback sensors. These feedback sen-
sors would represent dynamic real time data mecha-
nisms that assist and enable better understanding of the
problem - prior to cyber-attacks. The reliability of cyber
risk impact assessments could increase significantly if
decisionmakers have a dynamic and self-adopting AI en-
hanced feedback sensors to assess, predict, analyse and
address the risks of cyber-attacks in the supply chain.

The analytical framework in Fig. 3 firstly identifies and
articulates some of the possible supply chain solutions
for the role of machine learning (ML) in designing dy-
namic automated predictive feedback cognitive system,
supported with real-time intelligence. Secondly, the
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

analytical framework in Fig. 3 identifies cyber risk ana-
lytic approaches with dynamic real-time and ML self-
adapting enhanced technologies that enable predictive
risk analytics.

In doing this work we are acutely aware that adding
automation and further coupling to a distributed system
also brings new opportunities for cascading effects and
exposing new attack surfaces. These concerns are funda-
mental to the cognition engine design, especially in the
areas with increased automation of processes which have
classically required human interaction.

Furthermore, in terms of the (un) availability of data,
lessons can be learned from previous research on data
strategies (Radanliev et al. 2019b). The volume of data
generated creates diverse challenges for developing data
strategies in a variety of verticals (ex. AI/ML, ethics,
business requirements). Simultaneously, designing a sup-
ply chain cyber security architecture for complex
coupled systems, while understanding the impact, de-
mands data strategy optimisation and decision making
on collecting and assessment of probabilistic data when
edge computing nodes are deployed, presents a socio-
technical research problem. The research is also strongly
related to personal perceptions of risk because of collect-
ing probabilistic data at the edge interact with data regu-
lations, standards and policies. These data perceptions,
regulations and policies are strongly considered in our
approach for integrating ML in supply chain cyber risk
data analytics. A cybersecurity architecture for impact
assessment with ML cyber risk analytics must meet pub-
lic acceptability, security standards, and legal scrutiny.
With consideration of the above, the research integrated
areas such as impact, policy and governance recommen-
dations, while continuously anticipating aspects of com-
puter science to develop and design architectures for
ML in supply chain cyber risk data analytics. The re-
search contributes to knowledge by integrating supply
chain management with ML and cyber risk analytics that
have not been previously integrated in a research on se-
curing supply chains, and thus promote the field of de-
veloping a dynamic and self-adopting methodology to
assess, predict, analyse and address the risks of cyber-
attacks in the supply chains.

Discussion and main findings

The study applies taxonomic review and case study re-
search to derive with the design principles for a analyt-
ical framework with a transformational roadmap that
enables the process of integrating SME’s business and
supply chains in the 14.0 network. The analytical frame-
work captures the best practices in industry, and defines
the differences and similarities between 14.0 techno-
logical trends. Major projects on 14.0 are reviewed to
present the landscape for cutting edge developments in

Page 14 of 21

IloT, offering us a comprehensive picture of the current
state of supply chain adoption.

The analytical framework and the transformational
roadmap do not address the aspect of people but instead
the focus is on the process aspects of Industry 4.0. While
the people aspects are important given the general short-
age of individuals with appropriate digital skills, this
problem has been addressed by some countries e.g.
Australia with a points-based system for attracting
people with appropriate digital skills. The process as-
pects were determined as more important because In-
dustry 4.0 is going to require changes in business
practices (and hence processes), and there are multiple
approaches to structuring such processes as identified in
the case study of 14.0 initiatives. Creating a unified ap-
proach to process, with a step-by-step transformational
roadmap was missing in academic and industry litera-
ture. The design principles in Fig. 1, the target state in
Fig. 2 and the transformational roadmap in Fig. 3 derive
from the analysis of the state-of-the-art literature and
the leading 14.0 initiatives, presenting a unified approach
to process development.

Main findings pertaining to the analytical framework
Standardisation reference for 14.0 supply chains
The 14.0 adoption pertains:

a) Standardisation reference architecture (Ahmed
et al. 2013; Petar Radanliev et al. 2020; Stock and
Seliger 2016; Wahlster et al. 2013; Weyer et al.
2015).

b) Existing 14.0 architectures (Giordano et al. 2016;
Hermann et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2015), lack
clarification on designing individual components of
14.0 supply chains.

c) Despite the strong interest in literature and industry
for designing 14.0 and cyber risk standardisation
reference architectures, this is the first attempt to
integrate various academic models with industry
and government initiatives.

The design principles of the analytical framework de-
mystify this, by comparing models from academic litera-
ture with major projects from industry/governments and
clarify individual levels of 14.0 supply chain design.

Cloud integration of CPS and IloT of SME’s in the 14.0
supply chains
The SME’s need to:

d) Integrate cloud technologies in their supply chains
(Giordano et al. 2016; Ribeiro et al. 2010; Shafiq
et al. 2015; Thramboulidis 2015; Wahlster et al.
2013).
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

This study derives with the determining factors for an
HoT approach within Supply Chain Management in 14.0,
with the focus on SME’s cloud technologies. Some of the
direct recommendations in the design principals include
the deployment of self-sustaining networked sensors and
Cloud centric supply chains, symbiotic with the physical
environment.

Real-time CPS and IloT in 14.0
The SME’s digital supply chains need to:

e) Encompass the security and privacy (Anthonysamy
et al. 2017), along with electronic and physical
security of real-time data (Agyepong et al. 2019).

The findings from this study enable SMEs to integrate
HoT in their 14.0 businesses and supply chains with a
step-by-step transformational roadmap. The transform-
ational roadmap includes the design principles and out-
lines the process for integrating SME’s with real-time
enabled IIoT in the 14.0 supply chains.

Autonomous cognitive decisions for CPS and IloT in 14.0
In the 14.0 supply chains, machines should:

f) Connect and exchange information through cyber
network and be capable of autonomous cognitive
decisions (Kolberg and Zithlke 2015; J. Lee et al.
2015; Toro et al. 2015; Wan et al. 2015; Weyer
et al. 2015).

Existing literature lacks clarification on how such
automation can be designed in the context of 14.0 supply
chains. The study derives with design principles for cog-
nition in digital IloT supply chains and an 14.0 target
state for integrating IloT in digital supply chains.

Cyber risk concerns

The SMEs need security measures to protect themselves
from a range of attacks in their supply chains, while
cyber attackers only need to identify the weakest links.
Hence, the cyber risk creates a disadvantage for SMEs as
they need to invest a great deal of resources into cyber
protection and recovery planning. The transformational
roadmap enables SME’s to visualise and charts them on
the path to beginning to address the cyber risk. While
SMEs need to embrace the 14.0 in their supply chains,
but SMEs also need to be aware of the inherent cyber
risks. The taxonomic review and the case study in this
study, emphasised the vast areas of cyber risk and
brought the attention on cyber recovery.

Cyber risk assessment problems

The weakness of existing cyber risk impact assessment
models is that the economic impact is calculated on or-
ganisations stand-alone risk, ignoring the impacts of
sharing supply chain infrastructure (J. Nurse et al. 2017;
Radanliev et al. 2018a, 2018b, 2018c; Petar Radanliev, De
Roure, Nurse et al. 2018). In addition, there is an incon-
sistency in measuring supply chain cyber risks, which is
caused by the lack of understanding of supply chain op-
erations in 14.0. This study enables the process of visua-
lising the shared risk in supply chains. The visualisation
of such risks is vital for calculating and planning for the
impact to the SMEs operating in the 14.0.

Recovery plans for CPS and IloT in 14.0

Clarity on disaster recovery plans is missing in all of the
14.0 technological trends analysed in the case study, with
no explanation on details or on how recovery planning
would be executed. This is of concern as in the literature
the recovery planning is strongly emphasised. The ana-
lytical framework derives with direct recommendations
that would improve the response and recovery planning
in the SME’s supply chains. Some of the recommenda-
tions include the need for feedback and control mecha-
nisms, supervisory control of actions, and dynamics anti-
malicious and anti-tamper control.

Conclusion

By integrating AI/ML in the risk analytics, in this article
we devise a new approach for cognitive data analytics,
creating a stronger resilience of systems in their physical,
digital and social dimensions. Our approach resolves
around understanding how and when compromises hap-
pen, to enable systems to adapt and continue to operate
safely and securely when they have been compromised.
Cognition through AI/ML is the key topic of this re-
search and cognitive real time intelligence would enable
systems to recover and become more robust.

This paper identifies a dynamic and self-adapting system
supported with AI/ML and real-time intelligence for pre-
dictive cyber risk analytics. This will enhance national cap-
acities and assist in the creation of a comprehensive and
systematic understanding of the opportunities and threats
that arise when edge computing nodes are deployed, and
when AI/ML technologies are migrated to the periphery
of the internet and into local IoT networks.

We used a series of new design principles to derive a
transformational roadmap and a new analytical framework
for the SME’s supply chains integration in 14.0. Despite the
strong interest in the value for SME’s supply chain from
IloT and 14.0, this research represents the first attempt to
synthesise and compare knowledge from literature with ex-
pert’s opinions. This knowledge was applied to design a
step by step approach for the SME’s supply chains
Radanliev et al. Cybersecurity (2020) 3:13

integration with IloT technologies in the 14.0. In the design
process, the SME’s supply chain networks are related to the
14.0 initiatives and their technological trends.

The research discovered that successful adaptation of
HoT technologies, depends largely on the cyber re-
courses. This specifically concerns SME’s as they do not
have the same supply chain recourses as large enter-
prises. The new design enables SME’s to visualise the re-
quired cyber resources and the integration process and
the transformational roadmap the integration process of
HoT technologies consolidated in the cyber themes of
the future makeup of supply chains. The analytical
framework can also be applied to visualise and assess
their exposure to cyber risk and to design cyber recov-
ery. This visualisation also supports policy development
by decomposing operational system with concrete and
workable action plans, that would transition the eco-
nomic and social systems towards new cyber capabilities.

At a higher analytical level, the article presents new
design principles, a transformational roadmap and a new
analytical framework, for small and medium enterprises
to approach the new supply chains technological chal-
lenges in industry 4.0. The research’s insights are based
on a literature analysis, case study research and a
grounded theory methodology. The validation of these
research results was checked with experts from two cor-
porations, Cisco Systems and Fujitsu. The case study is
also informed by the sustained engagement of the UK
EPSRC IloT Research Hub PETRAS' with a broad set of
user partners for a wide range of private sectors, govern-
ment agencies, and charities at international scale.
