1. INTRODUCTION

Wireless networks technology-based internet of things (IoT) [1-3] has increased significantly [4, 5]
and interesting to study, especially smart health services [6, 7] such as monitoring systems for blood
pressure, heartbeat, and body temperature. IoT-based medical applications and health checks will provide
benefits for medical personnel in reducing costs, improving quality of life, strengthening medical
diagnoses [8], and subsequent treatment processes [9]. One form of health service that is of particular
concern is the examination of vital signs [10]. Based on information from the World Health Organization
(WHO), it stated that hypertension [11] and heart disease are the highest health risks. Furthermore, to support
health services can be implemented using e-health applications [12]. In 2014 Southeast Asia, especially
Indonesia, the death rate reached 35% due to heart disease, and 39% experienced age under 44 years.
One of the factors causing high mortality in heart disease is slow handling in examining the patient's
disease condition [13].

Monitoring vital signs [14] is a top priority that must be considered by health care centers to make
early prevention [15] and reduce mortality. Vital sign monitoring used by medical personnel to carry out vital
sign patients checks has available at the hospital. However, this equipment still based on conventional [16],
which certainly has weaknesses in terms of time efficiency. This condition positively affects patient health
services in real-time [17], especially in the process of diagnosing disease, operational costs, and the workload

of medical staff to increase. IoT-based vital sign monitoring becomes a solution to improve health services in
real-time [18] and overcome the problems of conventional medical equipment.

Several researchers are proposing research related to vital signs in diagnosing a patient's disease.
Implementation of the proposed design includes heartbeat monitoring [19] and body temperature using
Arduino [20, 21] based IoT. Research conducted shows that the heartbeat diagnosis information could control
through smartphones [22] and computer server [23, 24]. However, the sensors used by researchers are still
limited to heart rate and body temperature sensors. The author has not added a blood pressure sensor in
diagnosing a patient's illness. The next research proposed an ability analysis of the routing protocols in health
monitoring. The study results show that the recommended temperature heterogeneity energy (THE) method
can improve lifetime performance and throughput [25] in the IoT application. For conditions, the number of
patients that denser recommended using the optimized link state routing (OLSR) [26, 27] on MANET.
However, the researcher has not yet implemented the concept of routing protocols on IoT devices.
Patient health monitoring systems are based on simulations to determine IoT performance. The proposed
IoT-based vital signs monitoring system expected to reduce the workload of medical personnel and help
speed up the process of diagnosing a patient's illness in real-time.

2.3. Software design

Raspberry Pi is the main module in the design of processing software. This module functions to
program hardware using the Python programming language and stored in a .py extension file. The database
system uses MySQL, PHP, and Apache. Figure 4 demonstrates the stages of software.

2.4. Testing of vital signs device

Step of next is to test the vital sign sensor, which starts from the preparation of the measuring
instrument and verifying the device. This test aims to ensure the sensor is working correctly. First, heart rate
sensor testing done by placing one of fingertip onto the sensor. After that, it observed whether the sensor was
able to record heart rate data and display the beats per minute (BPM) value. The selection of the fingers and
the placement of the fingertips on the pulse sensor will produce more consistent and stable data.
Second, the DS18b20 sensor tested with grip the tip of the sensor and observing whether the sensor can
display the temperature in units of degrees Celsius. Temperature test results will display on the LCD in
degrees Celsius. This test as the basis that the DS18b20 sensor is functioning correctly or not functioning.
Body temperature data will vary according to the physical condition of the patient when retrieval data.
Third, blood pressure sensor testing done by installing a sensor on the wrist and observing whether the sensor
has responded to sensor data by displaying systolic and diastolic values on the LCD. The systolic value is
the highest pressure achieved when the heart muscle contracts. The diastolic value is the blood pressure in
the arteries when the heart is at rest.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Heartbeat

Heartbeat data measured to diagnose a patient's heart defects that can cause a heart attack. Heart rate
measurements of ten respondents were carried out under normal conditions or not doing activities. To find
out how much accuracy and system error in finding the value of the heartbeat. The proposed system design
compared with digital pulse sensors sold in the market. Measurements made three times to ensure
the accuracy of the resulting data with a time duration of one minute. The data obtained can see in the vital
sign database. The measurement of heart rate from a digital device will note on the data collection sheet,
which analyzed to conclude all data that has collected. The results of taking IoT-based heartbeat data are in
the numbers 78-95 BPM with an accuracy rate of 2.10%. The heartbeat data obtained still categorized as
normal because it is in the range of 60-100 BPM. These results indicate that the proposed design is
functioning normally. The result of heartbeat data taking showed in Table 1.

Table 1. Retrieval of heartbeat data

Id_Number Heartbeat (BPM) Error (%)
HRM-2511E Digital hearbeat
001 92 94 2.13
002 86 89 3.37

007 89 89 0
008 89 91 2.19
009 92 92 0
010 91 94 3.19
Average error 2.10

3.2. Blood pressure

Taking blood pressure data very determines the condition of a person's health. The normal blood
pressure for adults is 90/60 to 120/80 mmHg. The numbers of 90 mmHg and 120 mmHg are upper blood
pressure that indicate the level of heart contractions that push blood through the arteries to the body
(systolic). Table 2 shows the results of taking blood pressure data.

Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 10, No. 6, December 2020 : 5891 - 5898
Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708 O 5895

Values of 60 mmHg and 80 mmHg are low blood pressure that shows the amount of blood pressure
in the arteries when the heart rests, such as when sleep or silent (diastolic). Measurement and retrieval of
blood pressure sensor data performed on ten respondents. Tests carried out three times to see the level of
precision of the proposed device. Data generated in digital form by the Raspberry Pi module. The results of
data retrieval obtained from a blood pressure sensor compared with a digital blood pressure device that has
prepared. This value will use as a comparison between the proposed system design with commercial digital
devices. Based on the results of taking blood pressure data for ten respondents showed that the lowest value
of 115 mmHg and the highest value of 135 mmHg with an average error rate of 2.31%.

Table 2. Retrieval of blood pressure data

Id_Number Blood pressure (mmHg) Error (%)
MPX5050DP Digital blood pressure
001 115 120 4.17
002 120 125 4
003 130 129 0.78
004 138 136 1.47
005 130 130 0
006 125 125 0
007 128 130 1.54
008 128 130 1.54
009 135 134 0.75
010 120 120 0
Average error 2.31

3.3. Body temperature

Retrieval of body temperature data aims to analyze the condition of the body temperature
experienced by patients. An increase in body temperature will be directly proportional to the rise in heart
rate. Neither does the opposite if the body temperature decreases will be causing the heart rate to decrease.
Retrieval of body temperature data from ten respondents within three minutes was 36.40 to 36.90 OC.
Temperature data obtained are still in the healthy category for adults. The proceeds of this data collection
show that the proposed design is to work fine with an average accuracy of 0.49%. Table 3 shows the results
of taking body temperature data.

009 36.80 36.70 0.27
010 36.40 36.40 0
Average error 0.49

3.4. Vital sign monitoring system

Vital sign monitoring application consists of a login menu, data entry (id_number, name, age,
gender, address, and telephone number), patient data report, data retrieval process of body temperature,
blood pressure, heartbeat, and data storage. Figures 5 and 6 show the method of processing heartbeat,
body temperature, and blood pressure data. Data retrieval do by entering patient data. After entering the data,
proceed by inserting one of the fingertips into the HRM-2511E sensor. The MPX5050DP sensor mounted on
the wrist and the tip of the DS18b20 sensor held. Next, enter the value of the duration of data retrieval into
the time menu. After the duration value input, select the process menu. This menu serves to carry out
the process of retrieval sensor data attached to the body of the respondent. Respondent data that has recorded
will display on the LCD or web server with BPM (heart rate), mmHg (blood pressure), degrees Celsius
(body temperature). Vital sign data obtained can save by selecting the save menu. Furthermore, to display
respondent data can do by entering respondent data based on Id_Number.
