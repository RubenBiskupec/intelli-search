1 Introduction

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has the advantages of rapid deployment, good conceal-
ment, strong self-organization, and low price, so it is very suitable for target tracking, rec-
ognition, positioning, and other applications [1—4]. Node positioning is an important part
of these applications, and also the premise and basis. WSN can transmit information
more accurately only by determining its position coordinates [5—7].

At present, there are two commonly used positioning algorithms. One is based on dis-
tance, such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI), angle of arrival (AOA), and time
difference of arrival (TDOA). The characteristic of these algorithms is that the positioning
accuracy is very high, but the peripheral equipment needs to be provided, and the cost is
high [8-12]. Another is the range-free location algorithm, such as DV-Hop, centroid loca-
tion algorithm. These algorithms have low cost and low power consumption, especially
DV-Hop localization algorithm, which is easy to implement, requires a low proportion of

2 Related works
In recent years, many scholars have conducted in-depth research on the DV-Hop algorithm
and proposed different improved methods for the shortcomings of the algorithm, all of which
have improved the positioning accuracy and performance of the algorithm. The existing DV-
Hop algorithm is mainly improved from the following four aspects: optimizing the average
hop distance or minimum hop number, selecting the optimal beacon node, and optimizing
the location calculation method [17-24]. In literature [25], the teaching-learning-based
optimization (TLBO) algorithm was adopted to improve the DV-Hop. To obtain better posi-
tioning coverage, the hierarchical division from the target node to auxiliary beacon node was
adopted to upgrade the target node to the virtual beacon node in the next round of position-
ing, to improve positioning accuracy. In the second section of the DV-Hop algorithm, [26]
used the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to optimize the hop distance, which reduced
the influence of hop distance on the positioning error and improved the positioning accuracy.
However, the relation between the distance of beacon nodes and the adaptive value was not
considered [27]. uses the average hop distance of the nearest beacon node to calculate the un-
known node. The algorithm introduces threshold M, which uses the weighted average hop
distance of beacon nodes within M hop to calculate the average hop distance of unknown
nodes. The improved algorithm reduces the positioning error, but there are significant differ-
ences in the positioning error when different threshold M is used. In literature [28], the idea
of combining a weighted DV-Hop with a weighted hyperbolic localization algorithm was pro-
posed to improve the accuracy of algorithm positioning, but its computational complexity
was higher. Based on the realization of the double communication radius, the DV-Hop algo-
rithm based on a triple communication radius and multiple communication radius is pro-
posed in the literature [29]. Experimental results show that the more communication radius,
the smaller the positioning error, but the network overhead also increases.

Most of the existing DV-Hop algorithms assume that the path of the minimum num-
ber of hops between nodes is a straight line. However, the connections between nodes
are mostly the curves in practice. Therefore, the error occurs and accumulates in the

distances estimated by the number of hops and the average hop distance, that is, the
error increases with the number of hops.

In order to reduce the error of estimated distance between nodes and improve the accur-
acy of location algorithm, this paper presents an improved DV-Hop location algorithm
based on multiple communication radius. Based on the multi-communication radius loca-
tion algorithm, the method uses the cosine theorem to correct the hop number and esti-
mated average hop distance, and optimizes the estimated distance of the unknown node.
The algorithm uses multiple communication radius to broadcast the position to obtain the
minimum number of hops between the unknown node and the beacon node, and adjusts
the estimated hop distance by using the cosine theorem after estimating the good hop dis-
tance, and finally uses the trilateration method or the maximum likelihood estimation
method estimates the position coordinates.

3 The limitation of DV-Hop location algorithm
3.1 The principle of traditional DV-Hop location algorithm
The DV-Hop algorithm is a range-free location algorithm proposed by Niculescu et al.,
Rutgers University, based on the distance-vector routing principle. It is also called a
distance vector-hop location algorithm [30].

The process of DV-Hop localization algorithm is divided into three steps:

(1.) Distance vector interchange

>All sensor nodes are deployed in the monitoring area using random seeding to form the
actual network topology. At the same time, each beacon node broadcasts packets to the net-
work, including beacon node location information and hop value (initial value is 0). Each re-
ceiving node maintains the minimum hop value. Specific beacon nodes with higher hop
values are defined as useless information and ignored. The hop value is incremented by 1 at
each intermediate hop. Through this process, all nodes get the minimum number of hops.

As shown in Fig. 1, the number of hops between two adjacent nodes is 1, and the number
represents the hop value between the unknown node and the beacon node. The circular area

represents the wireless communication range of the beacon node.
(2.) Correction calculation and broadcasting

By using Eq. (1), the average distance per hop of each beacon node can be obtained
and broadcast continuously in the whole network as the correction value.

Fig. 1 Calculation of the number of hops between the nodes

 

After receiving the average hop distance value of the neighbor beacon node, the un-
known node multiplies the average hop distance value by the hop number to obtain the
estimated physical distance as follows:

dink — dvop,, x lim (2)

diy, is the estimated distance from unknown node m to beacon node k; dyop, is the
correction value of hop distance of unknown node m; and h,,,; is the minimum hops

value of unknown node m to beacon node k.
(3.) Positioning calculation

According to the average hop distance estimated in the second step and the mini-
mum hop received in the first stage, the two results are multiplied to obtain the esti-
mated distance between the unknown node and each beacon node, also known as hop
distance. When three or more hop distance values are obtained, a matching positioning
method (such as the least square method or trilateration method) is used to calculate

position coordinates of the unknown node.

3.2 Problems with DV-Hop algorithm

Through the analysis of the DV-Hop algorithm, it can be seen that the DV-Hop algo-
rithm uses the method of calculating the average distance of beacon nodes, so a large
error may occur in the positioning process.

Figure 2 shows a network with an uneven distribution of the nodes. The distance be-
tween unknown node U, and unknown node UW, is much smaller than that between un-
known node U> and beacon node B,, and the distance between beacon node By and
unknown node U3 is much smaller than that between unknown node UW, and unknown
node U3. In the DV-Hop algorithm, the distance between unknown node U3 and bea-
con node B, and between unknown node U, and unknown node WU, is calculated as
one hop, so there is a big error between the calculated average hop distance and the
real average hop distance. If the average hop distance of beacon node By is used to

calculate the distance from the unknown node to beacon node By, then there is a large

error between the calculated value and the real value.

4 The proposed algorithm

In order to solve the problem of large positioning error in the case of uneven dis-
tribution of network nodes, an improved DV-Hop algorithm is proposed in this
paper. Firstly, the algorithm uses the multi-communication radius to broadcast the
location and records the location, hop number of other beacon nodes. Then, the
distance between the unknown node and the corresponding beacon node is esti-
mated. The estimated hop distance is adjusted by using the cosine theorem. Finally,
the coordinates are calculated by using the trilateration method after obtaining the
location information of three or more beacon nodes. The localization process of
the proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 3.

4.1 Determining the minimum number of hops

In this paper, four communication radius are selected, namely R, 0.75R, 0.5R, and
0.25R, as shown in Fig. 4. The communication radius R is divided into four regions A,
B, C, and D. A region refers to the range of information broadcast by the beacon node
at the communication radius of 0.25R; B region refers to the range of information
broadcast by the beacon node at the communication radius of 0.5R; C region refers to
the range of information broadcast by the beacon node at the communication radius of
0.75R; D region refers to the range of information broadcast by the beacon node at the
communication radius of R.

When the beacon nodes broadcast information, the minimum hop from the node
of region A to the node i is set as 0.25; the minimum hop from the node of region
B to the node O is set as 0. 5; the minimum hop from the node of region C to
the node O is set as 0.75; the minimum hop from the node of region D to the
node O is set as 1. When the adjacent node receives the information sent by the

node with communication radius R, it is forwarded. After the information

broadcast is completed, the minimum hop value is obtained between each node.
The recorded minimum hop number may not be an integer, which refines the hop
number between nodes, making the minimum hop number more accurate and the

hop distance calculation more accurate.

4.2 Correct average hops distance
Note: J, is the time of hops between two beacon nodes; J,, is the number of hops be-
tween two beacon nodes; and J; = J,,/4.

(1) Selection of intermediate nodes

As shown in Fig. 5, if J, is odd, the intermediate node of the path is just the inter-
mediate node; if J, is even, the two hops in the middle of the path are the intermediate
nodes. The angle formed by the connection between the intermediate node and the
beacon node is 90° < a< 180°.

(2) Proving the angle range

Figure 6 is the schematic diagram of the angle and transmission path. There are two
routes between A and B, namely AC-CB and AD-DB. Obviously, B > a, and AC + CB is
closer to AB than AD + DB. Therefore, when the angle is greater, the distance of the

transmission path is closer to the linear distance between two points. When the angle

approaches 180°, the hop distance will be closer to the true value. Therefore, the angle
range (90° <a< 180°) is the most ideal.

(3) Solving the correction value using cosine theorem

There are two choices of intermediate nodes, so the calculation is divided into two
cases, J, is odd or even.

When J, is odd

As shown in figure (1) in Fig. 5, | B2B3 | is the distance from B» to B3, | B2M | is the
distance from B, to M, | B3M | is the distance from B; to M, and | B3M | is unknown.

According to the cosine theorem, these are the following expressions:
|B.B3|" = |BoM|? + |B3M|°-2 - |B.M|-|B3M|- cosa (3)

Since the node M is the middle node of the route, and | B.M | = | B3M | = dgy, |

B2B3 | = d. The following expressions can be obtained:
ds, = diy + day -2 - day, > Cosa (4)
After simplification, we can get,
d;, = 2d*,,,(1- cosa) (5)

The value of dzy, is,

5 Experimental results and analysis

In the Matlab environment, the improved location algorithm is simulated experimentally, and
the simulation results are analyzed and compared with the traditional DV-Hop algorithm and
DDV-Hop in [31]. The monitoring area is a square area of 100 x 100 meters. The number of
the nodes is N = 100 (30 beacon nodes). The communication radius is 30 m.

The following equation is the average positioning error:

N-
iz | T;-£; |

x 100% (16)

N is the number of nodes, 1 is the number of beacon nodes, R is the communication
radius, 7; is the actual coordinates, and E; is the estimated coordinates.

And the unknown nodes are distributed randomly and evenly. Figure 7 shows the dis-
tribution of the nodes.

The density of beacon nodes will affect the location accuracy of unknown nodes. When
the number of beacon nodes in the simulation region changes from 10 to 40, the trad-
itional DV-Hop algorithm, DDV-Hop algorithm, and improved DV-Hop algorithm pro-
posed in this paper are compared in simulation. Figure 8 shows the influence diagram of
beacon node number changes on positioning accuracy. It can be seen that the positioning
error of the improved DV-Hop algorithm is significantly lower than that of the traditional
DV-Hop algorithm, and the DDV-Hop algorithm when the number of beacon nodes is

10, which effectively reduces the positioning error, and the curve tends to be stable with

the increase of beacon nodes. The curve is stable but the positioning error is smaller than

the traditional DV-Hop algorithm and the DDV-Hop algorithm. The improved DV-Hop
algorithm proposed in this paper can use a few beacon nodes to reduce the cost.

The size of the communication radius determines the number of beacon nodes that
can be obtained by the unknown node. When the unknown node obtains more beacon
node locations, the positioning result becomes more accurate. When the communica-
tion radius varies between 20 and 50m, the traditional DV-Hop algorithm, DDV-Hop
algorithm, and improved DV-Hop algorithm proposed in this paper are compared in
simulation. Figure 9 shows the influence of communication radius change on position-
ing accuracy. With the increase of the communication range, the average positioning
error tends to decrease in all algorithms. Compared to the traditional DV-Hop algo-
rithm, the DDV-Hop algorithm has higher position accuracy in the simulation, but the
improved DV-Hop algorithm proposed in this paper has about 50% smaller localization

error in average.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, the improved DV-Hop algorithm adopts the multi-communication radius
to refine the number of hops and uses cosine theorem to correct the distance between
nodes. Under the same environment parameters, the traditional DV-Hop algorithm,
DDV-Hop algorithm, and improved DV-Hop algorithm proposed in this paper are
compared in simulation. The influence of two algorithms on the positioning error of
unknown nodes is compared under different beacon node density and communication
radius. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional DV-Hop al-
gorithm and DDV-Hop algorithm, the improved DV-Hop algorithm improves the posi-

tioning accuracy and reduces the average positioning error of the unknown nodes.
