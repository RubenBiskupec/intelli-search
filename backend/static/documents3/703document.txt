under Variable Working Conditions

Abstract

Most gear fault diagnosis (GFD) approaches suffer from inefficiency when facing with multiple varying working condi-
tions at the same time. In this paper, a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-theoretic co-clustering strategy is pro-
posed specially to classify more than one task at the same time using the high dimension matrix, aiming to offer a fast
multi-tasking solution. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is first used to obtain the time-frequency features from
the gear vibration signal. Then, the optimal clustering numbers are estimated using the Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) theory, which possesses the simultaneous assessment capability, compared with traditional validity indexes.
Subsequently, the classical/modified NMF-based co-clustering methods are carried out to obtain the classification
results in both row and column tasks. Finally, the parameters involved in BIC and NMF algorithms are determined
using the gradient ascent (GA) strategy in order to achieve reliable diagnostic results. The Spectra Quest's Drivetrain
Dynamics Simulator gear data sets were analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

1 Introduction

In those large-scale rotating machines, wear and tear
always comes out in the teeth surface of driving gears
if the pressure is not even or some extra impurities are
mingled in the lubricating oil. Health monitoring tech-
nology of mechanical components has been proved to
be effective at discovering early abrasion and reducing
the failure rate [1-5]. As one of the major tasks in health
monitoring, gear fault diagnosis (GFD) aims to assess
the current gear state based on the obtained measure-
ment data, then to inform users to take proper actions
[6]. A GFD procedure generally consists of three main
processes: (1) Data acquisition: data are collected from
sensors to monitor the health status of gears; (2) Feature
extraction: some feature extraction algorithms, such as

wavelet transform (WT) [7] and least squares support
vector machine (LSSVM) [8], are carried out based on
the prior knowledge to provide recognizable features; (3)
Fault recognition: classifiers are built to obtain gear faults
with the analysis of the extracted features.

Clustering technology, one of unsupervised fault rec-
ognition approaches, has experienced long term devel-
opment from partition based clustering to graph theory
based clustering as listed in Table 1. Most of these
algorithms were applied to fault diagnosis of rotat-
ing machinery. For instance, Yuwono et al. [9] com-
bined particle clustering with a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) for bearing fault diagnosis; Pacheco et al. [10]
classified gear fault severities using rough set theory.
These researches have provided effective clustering
applications related to machine fault diagnosis. How-
ever, they have a non-negligible limitation: each feature
vector is treated as independent and uncorrelated unit
in these clustering methods. In fact, strong correla-
tion exists between machine working conditions and

targeted diagnostic tasks. There is no doubt that clus-
tering analysis in one dimension will lose significant
information hidden in another dimension. To overcome
this limitation, a co-clustering strategy for variable
working conditions GFD is proposed in this paper. Co-
clustering was firstly utilized in the biology and medical
domains since this concept was mentioned by Mirkin
[11] in 1997. The joint clustering of genes shapes and
locations promoted the discovery of genetic structure
sequence [12]. Subsequently, co-clustering has been
expanded to other fields such as text analysis [13] and
search engines [14], etc.

In this study, co-clustering applications for gear
fault diagnosis have been developed. Compared with
previous GFD based on joint clustering methods, two
highlights in this paper can be obtained: (1) when one
varying working condition (such as rotating speed or
load) and one diagnostic task (such as fault severity)
are jointed in the same matrix, their correlations are
extracted, and the classification accuracy of the latter
can adjust with the range of the former; (2) when two
diagnostic tasks (such as fault severity and fault type)
are jointed in the same matrix, they can be classified
at the same time, which improves the diagnosis speed
compared with independent GFD strategy and offer a
fast multi-tasking solution.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents a brief summary about the appli-
cability of co-clustering. It also describes the princi-
ple and basic framework of co-clustering to solve the
GFD problem. Section 3 addresses the preparatory
work of GFD, especially a short-time Fourier trans-
form (STFT)-based feature extraction method. In Sec-
tion 4, the co-clustering numbers are estimated based
on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Then in
Section 5, the traditional and modified NMF-theoretic
co-clustering process is discussed in detail. To assess
these algorithms, the gradient ascend algorithm is also
implemented for parameters regulation in Section 6.
Section 7 concentrates on the varying working condi-
tion GFD experiments using the Drivetrain Dynamics
Simulator (DDS) system, which especially shows the

superiority of co-clustering compared with classical
clustering strategy such as X-means algorithm. Con-
clusions are drawn in Section 8 with discussions on the
future GFD application based on joint clustering.

2 Co-clustering Framework of GFD

Traditional clustering can be defined as: dataset X
exists in a limited data space, which can be repre-
sented with a n xd matrix, is composed of v ele-
ments: xj = (%i1)%i2)-++ »Xiq)'. The purpose of general
clustering is to segment dataset X into p categories:
Cy(k = 1,2,--- , DP).

T

X= [ape aj: xn], (1)

where i € {1,2,...,n}.

Different from general clustering, co-clustering could
be defined as: dataset X exists in a limited data space,
which can be represented with a m x n x d matrix, is
composed of m x n elements: xj = (xii, Xy2, ree Kid)
The purpose of co-clustering is to segment dataset X into
p and q categories in horizontal and vertical axis, respec-
tively: C’(k = 1,2,--- ,p)andCf(k = 1,2,--+,q).

wherei € {1,2,...,”}, 7 € {1,2,...,m}.

Currently, one challenge for fault diagnosis of gears is
that they are often operated under the varying working
conditions. To explain the influence of varying work-
ing conditions on the diagnosis performance, a typical
example is given in Figure 1 to compare the classification
results between classical and co-clustering strategies. In
the extracted feature matrix, different colors represent
different feature value. Cl—C5 represent different fault
categories; D1—D5 represent different working condi-
tions. R1I-R9 represent the lst clustering result; rl—r5
represent the 2nd clustering result. It can be seen that
the classical clustering results may be distorted due to the
fact that different working conditions have direct influ-
ence on the extracted features, and this makes difference
between final clustering categories (R1—R9) and real fault
categories (C1-C5). On the contrast, the co-clustering
can reflect the actual diagnosis results (R1-R5), which
shows the robustness of co-clustering in GFD under
interference environment.

Notice that, co-clustering is not limited in the two
dimensions. Theoretically, it can be generalized to
higher dimension (m> 3), thus giving an idea to solve

the 2D classification matrix is structured in two dimen-
sions: row for rotating speed and column for GFD task.
In Model (b), the 3D classification matrix is structured
in three dimensions: length for rotating speed, width
for load and height for GFD task. Structured high
dimension matrix is classified in each scale at the same
time, which offers an idea for GFD under more than
one working condition.

According to the description above, a co-cluster-
ing framework is constructed for gear fault diagnosis,
which is shown in Figure 3. The main process can be
divided into four sub-frames.

¢ Feature extraction sub-frame: as the input of this
model, the gear vibration signals are collected using
several tri-axial accelerometers installed in moni-
tored mechanical equipment, which may be oper-
ated in varying working condition environment.

3 STFT-based Feature Extraction

The performance of feature extraction algorithms
depends critically on the characteristic of the input
gear fault signals as well as the running environ-
ment of equipment. Because of the non-stationary
property of the vibration signal, general algorithms,
such as Fourier transform (FT), are not very useful in
this regard [24]. As a kind of time-frequency analysis
method, the main idea of short-time Fourier trans-
form (STFT) is to execute Fourier transform in short
sequential signals, cut by a sliding temporal window
function y(t), such as a Hanning or Hamming window
[25]. When analyzing the non-stationary vibration sig-
nal s(t), (¢ =1,2,...,f), we supposed that it can be
approximated as smooth among the window function
y(t). Therefore, the STFT of s(t) is calculated by time-
frequency units STFT (t, w) and is given by

+00
STFT (t, w) = / s(t)y*(t —He "dr, (3)

—OoO

where t means the position of window function y(s); w
represents the frequency parameter of STFT. Figure 4
illustrates a STFT example for a chipped tooth signal
with the Hamming window. It can be seen from Fig-
ure 4(d) that there are four main peaks (approximate
120 Hz, 500 Hz, 1160 Hz, and 1770 Hz) appearing in the
frequency domain of the STFT spectrogram. ‘The fre-
quency at 1770 Hz possesses the most obvious peak, up
to 0.5 V, compare to other peaks.

Since the short time Fourier spectrum reflects a dis-
tribution of energies among all frequencies and tempo-
ral intervals, we have to seek those ‘meaningful’ values
from the STFT graph. Without any known knowledge
of the running equipment, an effective method is to
find each maximum in the partitions of the STFT
spectrogram to represent the feature of sub-window.
Figure 5 gives an example of extracted features in the
chipped gear in Figure 4, including 10 x 10, 40 x 40 and
80 x 80 features. Generally, the row & column divided
dimensions depends on the non-stationary degree of
signal in time and frequency domain, respectively. This
figure indicates that more details are emerged in high
dimension features compared with low dimension fea-
tures. However, the increase of dimension will bring the
expansion of computational load as well as time con-
suming. Therefore, a middle dimension is suitable if the
definition and dimension are both acceptable, such as
the 40 x 40 features in Figure 5(c). Here STFT matrix
is composed of N? sub-matrixes sti; €¢ R(n/N x m/N),

4 BIC-based Clustering Number Estimation

In most practical gear fault diagnosis applications, it is dif-
ficult to know the estimated number of clusters in advance,
but the input clustering numbers always have direct influ-
ence in final clustering results. An optimal numbers estima-
tion strategy based on the cluster validity indexes is found
in historical literatures, including: the Calinski—Harabasz
index [26], the Davies—Bouldin index [27], the weighted
inter-intra index [28] and the in-group proportion index
[29]. However, two drawbacks exist in the cluster validity
indexes-based estimation strategy: (1) The estimation pre-
cision depends on selected clustering algorithm, dataset
as well as the validity index. For instance, both using the
IGP index, the affinity propagation (AP) method has more
credible optimal clustering-number compared with the
k-means strategy on account of the randomness of the lat-
ter [30]. (2) It is hard to apply the cluster validity indexes-
based estimation strategy to 2D or higher dimension
clustering like co-clustering because these validity indexes
are mainly calculated according to the distance algorithms
between different classes or within the same classes.

To find optimal numbers of co-clustering, an estimation
algorithm based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is
proposed. BIC is a statistical method which represents the
descriptive power of a model to dataset [31], including: (1)
the posterior likelihood of data estimation L; (2) The model
complexity |@|. The computational formula of BIC is given
by

1
BIC = AL — 5 |@|logN, (6)

where 4 means the weight factor; N is the totality of sam-
ples. In clustering, the posterior likelihood of data esti-
mation L is represented using the ratio of the mutual
information entropy between after-clustering I(S*; F*)
and before-clustering I(S;F). In Eq. (6), the entire

Page 6 of 15

meaning of L is that a good clustering must maintain
original information entropy as possible as it can,

L = 1(S*; F*) /1(S; F). (7)

But in 2D co-clustering, the BIC model requires to
take row and column clustering into consideration
at the same time. So we redefine the parameters as
follows:

 

 

Direction Sample Sample size Clustering
length number

Row n m k

Column m n |

 

According to these definitions, the BIC model com-
plexity in co-clustering can be re-expressed as

|O|,logm + |©|,logn = nklogm + mllogn. (8)

Substituting Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) into Eq. (6), we get Eq.
(9) as follows:

BIC(k, 1) = Al(S*; F*) /1(S; F) — (nklogm + millogn) /2.

(9)

Further, this Bayesian information criterion can be
extended to 3D field and is given by

BIC(k,l, p) = AI(S*; F*) /1(S; F)

— (ngklogm + mqllogn + qplogp) /3,
(10)
where p is the clustering number of the 3rd classification;
q is the size of the 3rd dimension. Based on the descrip-
tion of theory above, the details of BIC algorithm is given
as:
Input:

a. For single variable working condition GFD, the sam-
ple matrix C is structured by

x1 x1 x1
Caoxn = wae wae ,
x40 |, X40 | ; *40 |,
(11)
where Ea ree x49 |" represents the STFT val-

ues in continuous approximate one minute, which
depends on the change speed of working condition;
i € {1,2,...,m} represents the random samples col-
lected from different fault type and 1 is the number
of sample.

ple matrix C is structured by

Process:

a. Select an matrix construction method to build C
matrix according to the number of running environ-
ments;

b. Initialize the row clustering number k = 1, the col-
umn clustering number /=1, the weight factor

c. Fork from 1 tom, / from 1 to x:

BIC(k, 1) = Al(S*; F*) /I(S; F) — (nklogm + millogn) /2,
(13)

I(S;F) = D> | P(s.f log, [p(s.f) pp (f)])
(14)

where p(s, f ) means the joint probability distribution
between row and column; p(s) means the probability
distribution in row vector; p(f ) means the probabil-
ity distribution in column vector.

d. Search the max value of BIC during the whole k and /
domain:

arg min BIC(k, /). (15)

Output:

a. For single variable working condition GFD, it outputs
the number of final clustering numbers k and /;

b. For double variable working condition GFD, it out-
puts the number of final clustering numbers k, /, and

p.

5 Modified NMF-based Co-clustering

5.1 NMF Theory

Non-negative factorization (NMF) is a kind of efficient
data compression strategy, aiming to describe the high-
dimensional data set using few base vectors with the help
of the non-negative theory [32]. Different from the global

Page 7 of 15

characteristics of vector quantization (VQ) and prin-
ciple component analysis (PCA) theory, NMF offers a
good description about the local features, so specializing
in searching the small scale information. Non-negative
factorization has been investigated for feature extrac-
tion and recognition of rolling element bearing fault
[33]. However, the unique advantage of co-clustering has
not been explored for 2D or higher dimensions applica-
tion. The basic NMF problem is stated as the following
equation:

Cuxm ~ WaxdHaxm (16)

where Cy. is am X m non-negative matrix; the basis
matrix W and the gains matrix H are factorized from
Cuxm ad <(nxm)/(n+m) represents the reduced
rank. Therefore, Cy. can be linearly estimated by the
sub-vectors W,,,.g and Hy x. In order to obtain matrix
W and H, a large number of cost functions are defined to
quantify the degree of approximation. In our strategy, the
Euclidean distance is chosen as the cost function.
= C— WH’.

D(C||WH) (17)

The purpose of NMF is to find the W and H, which
possesses the smallest cost function: min D(C||WH)

s.t, W,H > 0. An iterative multiplicative algorithm is
carried out based on the updated rule of W and H, and is
given by

Hy, =H, ® | (CH; )@(W,H,H; |,
(18)
Wrii=W-® (wic)e(wsw,H,)|,

where ® is the element-wise multiplication, © is the ele-
ment-wise division; r represents the iteration.

5.2 Classical NMF-based Co-clustering

Recently, the clustering application based on NMF
has attracted much attention. Particularly, KIM, etc.,
explored the effective combination between cluster and
NMF [34]. This paper extends its application from single
cluster to co-clustering, aiming to solve the varying work
condition or multi-tasks problem. Rely on the compu-
tational W € R”*” and H &€ R’*” above, two objective
functions J; & J; are defined as follows:

J = ||W — cB" |’

 

2 (19)
i= Jar — C°B|| ,

 

 

where C’ = [cy,€9,..., cx] € R™* and Cy = [c1,C€2,...,
c)|° € R”*! represent the centroid matrix in row and col-
umn, respectively; The element cj,j € [1,2,...,k] of C’
means the cluster centroid of the jth cluster in Task I
Shen et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:16

and the element c;,j € [1,2,...,/] of C° means the clus-
ter centroid of the jth cluster in Task I, B” & B‘ denote
clustering assignment in Task I and Task II respectively.
In Task I, Bi = 1 means the ith sample belongs to the jth
cluster, otherwise Bj; = 0, and so is Task II.

The purpose of co-clustering is to find sparse matrix Bi
and B®, which has only one in each row, with others being
zero. Taking Task I and Task II as example, we redefine
C’ and C“ as

C’ = W(B")'(D')™,

_ (20)

c= H"(B)"(D)
where (D")~! = diag(lci|~", |co|~",..., Came e RKxK
and (D°) 1 = diag(Ie1l, |co|~°,...,5 lcy|~°) e RX!

Meanwhile, we set (D") ~ = D}D5, (D°) += D‘ Ds, then
Eq. (19) can be expressed as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Je = ||w — w(B’)" (D’) ‘a |)
= |w _ w(B")" Di D5B" || (21)
= ||w —w(m')'n’ :

Jy = |" — "(BF)" (D9) 1B")
= |W" — HH" (B°)"DiDsB° ° (22)

 

 

— Ja — H™(M°)'N° *

 

 

where M" = (Dj) 'B’, N" = (Dj) B", M° = (D{) BS,
N° = (DS) B°.

Finally, a second order NMF is applied in Jz and J,
aiming to factorize W to W(M’ yt and N’, to factorize
H" to H'(M‘)! and N“. Therefore, the B” and B¢ matrix
is obtained according to the second order NMF result.
After that, the classifications in row and column are
obtained from the B’ and B* matrix.

5.3 Modified NMF-based Co-clustering

As described in Section 5.1, non-negative matrix C is
factorized into two sub-matrices W and H in conven-
tional non-negative factorization. Although the physi-
cal meanings of W and H are clear: they represent the

Page 8 of 15

decomposition values in row and column respectively
and promote the classification effect of co-clustering, the
relation between two directions is still ill-defined. Hence,
the typical NMF is improved and is given by

Cuxm ~ WaxkLkxtixm (24)

where Lj is named as ‘the relation matrix’, the value Lj
represents the link between the ith cluster in Task I and
the jth cluster in Task IE, k is the clustering number in
the row vector and / is the clustering number in the col-
umn vector. In modified NMF, the cost function and the
update functions can be re-written as

D(C||WLH) = C — WLH’, (25)

Hy41 =H; ® |(CH; )O(WLH,H; ) |, (26)
Wrii=W,@|(WPC)O(W;WLH,)|, (27)

Lyi = Wy, CAS), (28)

where ® is the element-wise multiplication, © is the ele-
ment-wise division; r represents the iteration; W~ is the
generalized inverse of W: WW*W = W; H™ is the gen-
eralized inverse of H: HH*H = H.

By introducing the matrix L, the W and H are not
required to be orthogonal in modified NMF strategy.
Therefore, it expands the optional range of W and H and
improves the factorization performance, which will be
proved in Section 7.

6 GA-based Parameter Regulator

Three parameters need to be designed in the co-cluster-
ing-based GFD strategy, including: (1) the feature-dimen-
sion N in STFT; (2) the weight factor 2 in BIC algorithm;
(3) the transitional dimension d in traditional NMF-
based co-clustering, which are listed in Table 2.

Among these three parameters, the feature-dimension
N in STFT can be decided from the GFD experiments. /
and d will be adjusted using the gradient ascent (GA) reg-
ulatory mechanism [35, 36], whose fundamental is shown
in Figure 6. The main idea of gradient ascent algorithm
is to follow the fastest changing direction to find the

ent initial points of (/,d) are listed as example, where the
approximation curves @ and @ reach the global opti-
mum while @) and @ are limited in the local optimum.

Meanwhile, three concepts are included in the gradient
ascent model:

« The step length sl: it represents the speed
along the gradient direction during the itera-
tion. We initialize the step length as 0.02 in the
parameter A & d/min(m,n), where 0<4/ <1,
0 < d/min(m,n) < 1;

« The learning function: it has been designed in NMF-
based co-clustering classifier as:

{Li, Li} = NMF{x;,2,[d/min(m,n)]}, (29)
where x; represents extracted STFT feature vector
from the ith sample; NMF(-) means the NMF-based
co-clustering classifier, with three input parameters
{xj A, [d/min(m, n)|}; L* and Li means the cluster-
ing results of the ith sample in row and column.

« The validity function: it is calculated by the sum of
correct classifications, and it assesses the effective-
ness of classification.

where y; and yi represents the label of the ith sample;
zer(-) means the zero sign function. Notice that, the
validity function can only be obtained in those train-
ing samples, whose classification labels are known.

The optimal 2 and d/min(m, n) is gained according
to the training samples and is used in others, called
testing samples.

It should be noted that in real GFD application, when
performing GA algorithm: (1) If the step length is too
large, the optimal parameter result might be skipped. But
if the step length is too small, the iteration speed will be
slow and cause too large computational load. (2) It is easy
for the GA algorithm to be deep in the local optimum
rather than the global optimum, which relies on the initial
location of {A, d/min(m, n) \. Therefore, it is necessary to
take these two factors into consideration to balance the
computational accuracy and the time consumption.

7 Experiments and Performance Analysis

7.1 DDS Experimental System

The Spectra Quest’s Drivetrain Dynamics Simulator
(DDS) was used in this study for experimental verifica-
tion, as shown in Figure 7. This system is composed of
six units including: (1) speed regulator; (2) the driving
motor; (3) the planetary gearbox; (4) the reduction gear-
box; (5) brake device; (6) brake regulator. The faults occur
in those gears in planetary & reduction gearboxes, under
varying rotating speed and load conditions, which are
adjusted using the speed regulator and the brake regula-
tor, respectively. Four types of gear faults are studied: (1)
root cracks; (2) missing teeth; (3) chipped teeth; (4) sur-
face wear. The purpose of GFD is to classify these faults
through 7 vibration sensors (3-axis for planetary gearbox;
3-axis for reduction gearbox; 1-axis for driving motor). In
addition, in order to put the co-clustering methods into
effect, we define different levels in four task sets listed in
Table 3, including: (1) the fault type task (C1—C5); (2) the
fault severity task (D1—D4); 3) the speed regulator task
(E1—-E5); (4) the load regulator task (F1—-F5). Specially, the
rotating speed curve and the load curve in Figure 8 was
also conducted.

7.2 GFD Experiments and Performance Analysis
7.2.1 Experimental Setup
The varying rotating speed and load are designed using
the regulator curves in Figure 8 for the experiment. In
order to enlarge the data analytical ability of algorithms,
10 repeat collections were implemented to increase the
sample points to 10 times (5120 x 50x 10) in each group,
which are segmented by the 2.5 s sub-signals. There-
fore, the sample number for fault type recognition can
be gained in row clustering task (fault type) and column
clustering tasks (rotating speed and load), and are listed
in Table 4A and 4B.

In the fault type recognition experiments, several
tests are compared using the models as follows: (1)

parameters were set as: A = 1,d = 30.

7.2.2 Experimental Results and Discussion

Experiments are carried out, and the column task in
Table 4 is considered to improve the effectiveness of row
task in co-clustering method. In order to assess the qual-
ity of models, the Pr (C;) and Re (C;) indexes of clustering
results are calculated and given by

Corrected classfied C; samples
Pr (C3) = — _,

All C; samples (32)

Re(C;) =

(33)
where the Pr (C;) index reflects the ability that a model
identifies correct samples while the Re (C;) index reflects
the ability that a model finds all correct samples.

At first, we observed the fault type recognition results
using the NMF-based co-clustering strategy under vary-
ing rotating speed and load environment, which are
listed in Table 5. This table indicates that the diagnostic
accuracy of co-clustering strategy in various load condi-
tions (97.8%) is better than that in various rotating speeds

(96.3%). This can be explained by two possible reasons:
(1) The classify boundary of the latter is more clear
than the former since that the rotating speed presents a
gradual change characteristic from 0 Hz to 40 Hz while
the brake load jumps from 0 to 14.63 N-m; (2) Chang-
ing the rotating speed has a stronger interference effect
than just changing the load to collected vibration signal,

which have been verified in our previous study. Secondly,
to illustrate clustering performance in the varying rotat-
ing speed model, the NMF-based co-clustering results
are listed in Table 6 (k=6; /=6) and Figure 9, where 200
samples are tested in each category. Some details can be
seen here: (1) the misclassification cases always appear
between ‘Health’ and ‘Surface’ or between ‘Root; ‘Miss-
ing’ and ‘Chipped’ because the time domain features of
the former are more similar but the frequency domain
features of the latter are alike. For example, the ‘Chipped’
type is easy to be classified as the ‘Missing’ type if the
crack of chipped tooth is large enough; (2) The 6th cate-
gory (R2 and R3) occurs in the C2 type when the number
of clustering is set as 6, which means the discrete ability
and the inconsistency exists inside the ‘Root’ samples.
Interestingly, although the differences exist in local pre-
cision and recall index of different categories, the total
precision and recall are very nearly the same in these two
tables.

Especially, we reclassify the fault types of testing sam-
ples in Table 4 using the modified NMF-based co-clus-
tering strategy. Here the normalized relation matrix Lz,
(k=I1=5) can be gained and given by

Notice that, the element /;; represents the relevance
between the ith category in row task and the jth cate-
gory in column task. In the L;,,; matrix, the / rises up to
approximate 7 in ‘Missing’ & ‘Chipped’ fault type with the
increase of rotating speed. The effect of speed regulator
on different fault types presents the following rank: Miss-
ing~Chipped>Root>Health~Surface. However, there is
a less link between load and fault types, seeing from the
Lx; matrix under changing load environment. In order
to further verify the necessity for modified NMF, Table 7
gives the evaluation indexes of this approach. It shows
that an improved precision occurs in the varying rotat-
ing speed dataset but makes no difference in the varying
load dataset. That is because the L;,,; matrix in modified
strategy cuts off the link between W and H in the for-
mer, which promotes the separation ability between row
and column task. As can be seen in Table 7, the middle
dimension of W and H is not limited in a single value, like

traditional NMF method does, thus improving both the
flexibility of selected dimension and the GFD precision
(97.0% and 97.8%). Also, it can be known that the recog-
nition performance of various loads (100%) is superior
to rotating speed (95.3%) on account of the continuity of
speed regulator.

Finally, concentrating on the varying working condi-
tion GFD, the traditional clustering strategies, including
the K-means and the GMM methods, and co-clustering
approaches were compared using two selected indexes:
the precision and the time consumption. The perfor-
mance comparison results are listed in Table 8. Accord-
ing to this table, although the time complexity of single
algorithm of 1D clustering is smaller than joint strategy
(4.923 s<7.991 s), the accumulation of computational
load for two tasks is larger than co-clustering proposed
(4.923 s+ 4.856 s>7.991 s). Meanwhile, the co-clustering
have an apparent precision increase in varying working
condition GFD, about 12.51% in varying rotating speed
and 7.00% in varying load. Therefore, this experiment
proves the superiority of co-clustering in gear fault diag-
nosis under variable working conditions.

7.3 Parameter Regulation Experiments

7.3.1 STFT Dimension Adjustment Experiments

During the STFT dimension adjustment experiments, we
adjusted the feature dimension N from 10 to 80 one by
one, and then the diagnostic precisions of Task I as well
as the time consumptions of co-clustering model were
observed and were drawn in Figure 10. It can be seen that
the diagnostic accuracy increases from 78.76% to 97.54%
when the feature dimension N increases from 10 to 80,
meanwhile, the computational load indicates an expo-
nential increase from approximately 16.78 s to 48.45 s.
It can be seen from Figure 10 that N=42 is considered
as an appropriate dimension, in which the diagnosis
accuracy is satisfactory enough (97.02%), while the time
consumption keeps at a low level (25.12 s). Although the
precision will continue to improve up to 97.54% if we

continuously increase the feature dimension, but compu-

7.3.2 BIC Algorithm Experiments

Based on the dataset from Drivetrain Dynamics Simula-
tor (DDS) system, we tried to adjust the number of clus-
ter in row and column, respectively. Generally, the search
range of clustering number is from 2 to 10: 2< k <10;
2</<10. Figure 11 illustrates an example of the BIC
results in varying load GFD experiments when the clus-
tering number changes from 2 to 10. It can be seen that
the peak of BIC value (— 8124) exists at the point (5,5),
which means that the optimal co-clustering results hap-
pens when the row and the column clustering numbers
both equal to five. According to the real dataset and the
standard labels in Table 3, the BIC-based estimation algo-
rithm satisfies the requirements of practical gear fault
diagnosis applications.

For further study on the BIC estimation algorithm, the
BIC method was compared with a kind of traditional self-
adapting classification estimation algorithm: X-means,
which is an improved strategy of K-means. The estima-
tions of clustering number in BIC as well as X-means
algorithm are listed in Table 9. On one hand, for the BIC
algorithm, with the increase of clustering number k, the

diagnostic precision presents an increasing trend from
60.0% to 96.9% first, then it begins to slightly decrease
when the clustering number k is larger than 5. On the
other hand, by comparing the estimation results between
X-means and BIC algorithm, we find the estimation of
clustering number using the X-means is much larger than
the normal (k=12) and also its diagnostic precision is
only 84.1%, which proves the superiority of BIC-based
clustering number estimation.

7.3.3 GA Parameter Regulator Experiments

As shown in Figure 4, the gradient ascent algorithm was
used in the varying working condition datasets to obtain
the weight factor 2 and the transitional dimension d.
The regulator results of the gradient ascent algorithm
are listed in Table 10. Here the final (A, d), the num-
ber of iterations as well as the precision of row task are
observed using 4 initial (A, d) values: (0.5, 500), (0.5, 200),
(0.7, 500), (0.7, 200). After gradient ascent, it could be
seen that four initial values all reached the global opti-
mum in varying load experiments. But in varying rotat-
ing speed experiments, only two points reach the global
optimum, which achieves 99.3% diagnostic accuracy. In
addition, it can be found that the less iterations occur
when the distance between initial and final (/, d) point is
short. Therefore, these tests prove that the performance
of GA algorithm depends on the selected initial point to
a great extent.

8 Conclusions

A NMF-theoretic co-clustering strategy is presented in
this paper to offer a fast multi-tasking solution to solve the
gear fault diagnosis problem under variable working con-
ditions. Here the time-frequency features are extracted
from the STFT spectrogram, and are utilized to structure
the 2D matrix for joint clustering. Experiments indicate
that 97.02% diagnostic precision can be achieved when
the STFT dimension is set as 42. Meanwhile, seeing from
the results of the BIC-based optimal clustering number
estimation, they are close to the practical categories, no
matter in varying rotating speed or varying load dataset.
After NMF, row and column clustering task can be identi-
fied at the same time, with approximately 10% improved
accuracy and less time cost compared with those single
task clustering algorithms, such as X-means and GMM
algorithm. There is an internal connection in most of gear
failure signals. The proposed co-clustering strategy has
better performance than independent clustering strategy
because the modified NMF helps to provide a relation
matrix, which shows a strong correlation between differ-
ent rotating speeds and fault types. Therefore, the NMF-
based co-clustering has a good potential to apply in the
gear fault diagnosis of large-scale rotating machines under

varying working conditions. In the future, co-clustering
with higher dimension will probably apply in the more
complex working conditions or more diagnostic tasks to
improve the gear fault diagnosis performance.
