and nerve injuries

Imitation of the perception system of living creatures is of great importance for the construction of artificial nerves and intelligent
human-machine interfaces. However, a prominent challenge is to emulate the functions of the biological synapse, which is the
basic building block of the neural system. Here, inspired by the pain perception mechanism of the living creatures, a flexible
double-layer memristor was constructed, with 90% semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) covered by LiClO,
doped polyoxyethylene oxide (PEO: LiClO,) as the channel materials. The carriers (protons and Li*) from PEO: LiClO, imitated the
functions of Na‘ and K* in biological systems. A potentiation of the post-synaptic signal was observed with mild stimuli, while the
post-synaptic signal was inhibited with severe stimuli with a pulse voltage larger than 1.4V in this research. These behaviors
resemble the sensation of pain, neuroprotection, and possible injuries to the neural system. To explore the underlying mechanism
of the phenomenon, the fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectrum,
and current (IV) sweep were carried out. It was inferred that the observed results are attributable to the interaction between carriers
in PEO: LiClO, and functional groups and defects in the s-SWCNTs. The enhanced channel current results from the fulfillment of the
traps by the carriers, and the suppression of the current is due to the intercalation of Li* in the s-SWCNTs. This flexible artificial
synapse opens a new avenue for the construction of biocompatible electronic devices towards artificial intelligence systems.

INTRODUCTION

Pain, a self-protective response of living creatures, is a symptom
that may be caused by a disease or an acute stimulus. The pain
signal, activated by nociceptors distributed at the peripheral
terminals, is transmitted to the central nervous system via dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) or trigeminal ganglion neurons’. The
sensation of pain is an important adaptive mechanism in
biological systems. On the one hand, it can protect a person
from further injury by transmitting pain-causing signals such as
heat, pressure and chemical agents to the somatosensory
thalamus. Then, the subsequent protective responses can be
made immediately. On the other hand, pathological and severe
damage pain can be limited by suppressing the neuronal
excitation through the activation of TREK2 channels, which are
known to be neuroprotective agents””. Thus, the overexpression
of the neuron signal can be inhibited in cases of neuropathic
injury of the nervous system due to painful stimuli. To uncover the
pain perception mechanisms, a great amount of effort has been
made, and many studies have demonstrated that various ion
channels are involved in the development of pain perception® ®.
Recently, with the development of molecular cell biology and
genetic engineering, the molecular basis of ion channels has been
elucidated. It is believed that voltage-controlled Na’ and K*
channels are involved in the sensation and transmission of
pain*”’'®. In brief, the membrane potentials of the peripheral
nerve terminals are depolarized when the stimuli activate
peripheral terminals through nociceptive ion channels. Then, an
action potential is induced through the activation of voltage-
dependent Na~* channels once the threshold of the membrane
potential is reached. In contrast, the mechanism for suppressing
excitability by a negative membrane potential is proved to be

related to hyperpolarization of the membrane potential by leak K*
channels. This behavior leads to a decrease in the conduction
fidelity across the axon or limited neurotransmitter release at the
axon terminals, which prevents the neuron from generating an
action potential. Therefore, ion channels are crucial determinants
for the adaptive mechanism of pain sensation.

Artificial synapses, which can emulate most of the functions of
biological synapses, have attracted a tremendous amount of
attention''"'°. Much effort has been made to study the device
structures, material systems, and switching mechanisms to
demonstrate synaptic characteristics and improve the device
performance since synaptic behaviors were mimicked by Mead in
1996 using a floating-gate silicon MOS transistor'*. For example,
memristor- and transistor-based artificial synapses with coplanar
and vertical structures made of metal oxides, organic/inorganic
perovskites and two-dimensional materials have been investi-
gated'°-*°. Based on these synaptic devices, a number of
biologically inspired functions, such as visual information proces-
sing, speech recognition, and movement control, have been
realized. In addition, benefiting from the development of
biologically inspired systems, great achievements have occurred
in many fields, including neuromorphic computing?'*, bio-
inspired sensing systems7°, control theory for legged robots**”°,
and prosthetics*°*”. However, the emulation of pain perception
using synaptic devices has not been reported despite progress in
the design and fabrication of artificial synapses.

Herein, inspired by the working mechanism of the pain
perception system of living creature, a memristor-based structure
artificial synapse with double-layer active materials was designed,
in which LiClO, doped polyoxyethylene (PEO: LiClO,), a bio-
adhesive, mucoadhesive, and biocompatible polymer, was

selected as the top-layer material. The protons and Li” in this layer
behave like Na* and K™ in biological systems. 90% semiconduct-
ing single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) were used as the
bottom-layer material due to their unique physical, electrical, and
mechanical properties and easy modulation of the electrical
charges in SWCNTs by altering their surrounding electrical
environment?®. The observed channel current is attributed to
the hopping of carriers through functional groups. In addition, it
can be enhanced due to the reduction in the barrier resulting from
the fulfillment of the traps and limited by the intercalation of the
Li’ in s-SWCNTs. Therefore, Na~ and K* dynamics in biological
systems can be mimicked by the cooperation of protons and Li*
in artificial synapses. Consequently, the pain perception and
possible nerve injuries caused are successfully emulated.

RESULTS

Figure 1(a—-l) shows a schematic diagram of the pain perception
mechanisms of living creatures. The pain-causing signals, such as
external stimuli and tissue disease, are detected by receptors
distributed at the nociceptor peripheral terminals. Then, the pain-
signal is transmitted to the sensory cortex of the somatosensory
thalamus via the afferent nerve (DRG or trigeminal ganglion
neurons). Once the sensation of pain occurs, appropriate
protective responses are taken either via a nervous reflex or
commands from the brain. In this process, Na* plays an important
role in neuronal excitability and neuron signal transmission. In
addition, the central nervous system utilizes descending inhibitory

npj Flexible Electronics (2020) 3

pathways to modulate the transmission of nociceptive stimuli,
which is considered as a neuroprotective and adaptive mechan-
ism of the neural system*. Kt plays an important role in the
inhibition of neuronal excitability by counteracting action
potential, limiting neurotransmitter release at the axon term-
inals*?. This neuroprotective mechanism can suppress the over-
expression of the neuron signal in the case of neuropathic injury
of the nervous system due to acute painful stimulus stimuli. The
roles of Na’ and K* are shown in Fig. 1(a-II) and (a-ill). Figure 1b
shows the optical image and schematic diagram of the flexible
artificial synapses. In this device, protons and Li’ were employed
to mimic the functions of Na’ and K™ in biological synapses
because the electrical properties can be modulated easily by the
intercalation of Li* into s-SWCNTs, benefiting from its smaller
atomic sizes. In addition, no additional impurities need to be
introduced if the protons are employed as charge carriers. The
atomic force microscope (AFM) image of the s-SWCNTs, the
bottom-layer material of the memristor, is shown in Fig. 1c. The
XPS spectra in Fig. 1d show the presence of functional groups in
the s-SWCNTs, which contribute to the hopping process of the
carriers. The detailed fabrication procedure of the artificial
synapses is presented in the methods section and Supplementary
Figs 1 and 2. A distinguished behavior in the IV characteristics for
different sweeping voltages was observed and is shown in
Fig. 1e, f. An anticlockwise hysteresis was measured with a small
sweeping voltage of 1 V, which indicated a synaptic potentiation.
However, with the increase in sweeping voltage, 2Vin this
research, a clockwise hysteresis was observed at the voltages

between 1.4V and 2V, which implies synaptic inhibition. The
enlarged IV characteristics in the voltage between 0V and —1.5V
are shown in Fig. 1g to provide a clear picture of the intersection
of the clockwise and anticlockwise hysteretic loops. Moreover,
almost no degradation of the device performance is observed
under the bending condition and even for a small bend radius of
~6mm as shown in Fig. 3, which demonstrates the flexibility of
the device.

To explore the underlying mechanism for the voltage-
dependent potentiation and inhibition behaviors of the artificial
synapse, the physical and electrical properties of s-SWCNTs and
PEO: LiClO, and their possible interactions were investigated.
Supplementary Fig. 4a, b show the typical IV curves for the devices
with s-SWCNTs or PEO: LiClO, as the channel materials. In addition,
the current was two orders of magnitude smaller than that
measured from the double-layer artificial synapse. These results
imply that the observed memristive behaviors described in Fig. 1f
are attributed to the interaction between s-SWCNTs and PEO:
LicClO,. From the FTIR spectra in Fig. 2a for PEO: LiClO, PEO: LiClO,;:
CNT1, and PEO: LiClO,: CNT2 (PEO: LiClO,: CNT2 has a higher s-
SWCNT concentration than PEO: LiClO,: CNT1), a frequency region
is of particular interest. The band at 1093cm7' observed in the
FTIR spectrum of PEO: LiClO, originates from the C—O-C stretch.
This confirms the presence of crystalline PEO, which is also
supported by the optical images and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns in Supplementary Fig. 5. When s-SWCNTs were blended
into the PEO: LiClO, matrix, a redshift of the C-O-C stretch was
observed with the peak shifting to 1103cm~' and 1115cm_',

respectively, for low- and high-s-SWCNT doping concentrations.
Additionally, the crystallinity of the blended materials decreased
with increasing s-SWCNT concentration, as proved by the XRD
patterns in Supplementary Fig. 5d. This phenomenon is due to the
wrapping of carbon nanotubes by PEO: LiClO,. The carbon
nanotubes with large surface areas and many functional groups
indicated by the XPS spectra in Fig. 1d can disrupt the chain
folding and restrict the organization of PEO: LiClO, chains, leading
to a decrease in the crystallinity and an enhancement in the ionic
conductivity. As a result, the enhanced ionic conductivity
contributes to an obvious increase in the current of the artificial
synapse compared with those of s-SWCNTs or PEO: LiClO, as the
channel materials independently.

With the known interaction of s-SWCNTs and PEO: LiClO,, the
ionic dynamics of the artificial synapses must be investigated.
First, anticlockwise and clockwise hysteretic loops were measured
in the small (0-1.4 V) and large (1.4—2 V) voltage sweeping regions,
respectively, for the artificial synapse discussed in Fig. 1. However,
the IV characteristics extracted from the device with s-SWCNTs
covered by chitosan (CS) as the channel material (Supplementary
Fig. 6) show an anticlockwise hysteresis regardless of the
sweeping voltage. This outcome is believed to be a result of the
hopping and trapping of the protons, as reported in previous
research*’?'. From this comparison, it can be inferred that there
are two different carriers contributing to the memristive behaviors
of the artificial synapse in this research. Since the PEO: LiClO,
membrane was employed as the top-layer material, it is
considered that protons and Li* play significant roles in the ionic

dynamics of the device. Forward and reverse IV characteristics
plotted on the log scale are presented in Fig. 2c, d, respectively, to
uncover the ionic behaviors from the investigation of the
conduction mechanism. A current change from the low-
exponent space charge limited current (SCLC) to the high-
exponent SCLC is observed in the forward IV curve with increasing
voltage, as indicated in regions |, Il, and Ill of Fig. 2c. The behavior
is controlled by the fulfillment of the trapping sites by the carriers
and diminishes the existing trap concentration gradually in order
of the energy levels, which leads to an increase in the
conductance. However, a decrease in conductance is achieved
as the voltage further increases, as shown in region IV of Fig. 2c.
This result is ascribed to the intercalation of Li* in the s-SWCNTs;
in turn, the motion of Li* along the radial direction is limited due
to radial confinement, leading to a lower mobility**. Regarding the
reverse trace in Fig. 2d, a further decrease in the conductance in
the high-voltage region (region IV is observed due to the
continuous intercalation of Li* in the s-SWCNTs. These behaviors
result in a clockwise hysteresis in this region. With the decrease in
voltage (regions |, Il, and Ill), a more conductive channel than that
of forward sweeping is obtained, benefiting from the unreleased
carriers in the trapping sites. As a consequence, an anticlockwise
hysteretic loop is generated.

These two processes can also be supported by investigating the
IV behaviors with various measurement temperatures and humid-
ities, as shown in the Supplementary Figs 7 and 8). Except for the
increase in current described by the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF)
equation®’, a clockwise hysteresis in the IV curves that gradually
diminishes with increasing temperature is observed (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the structures
of Li* trapped inside carbon nanotubes through topological defects
in the sidewall are dependent on the temperature, and an ordered
structure exists, especially at low temperatures. In contrast, the
clockwise hysteresis gradually dominates the IV characteristics as
the humidity decreases (Supplementary Fig. 7). This is due to the
decrease in proton concentration with decreasing ambient
humidity, which leads to LiT being the main carrier in the device.

Published in partnership with Nanjing Tech University

Consequently, a smaller current resulted from the reduced carrier
concentration, and a gradual domination of the clockwise hysteresis
caused by the intercalation of Li* in the s-SWCNTs was observed. In
addition, if the device was dried at 100°C for 24h, it exhibited
similar behavior to that measured at low humidity. That is, a
clockwise hysteresis independent of the sweeping voltage is
observed if the sample is fully dried as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 9, which also proves that the clockwise hysteretic loop is a
result of the Li’ in the channel. Furthermore, the conduction
mechanism of the devices measured at high temperature (85 °C)
and under dry conditions in Supplementary Fig. 10 is also evidences
for the validity of the above analysis. Therefore, it is concluded that
the SCLC transition caused by the charge trapping/de-trapping
process and the intercalation of Li* in the s-SWCNTs contribute to
the memristive behaviors of artificial synapses. The protons and Li”
in the artificial synapse play roles resembling those of Nat and K*
in biological systems.

Based on the above discussion, a schematic diagram of the
working mechanism of the artificial synapse is proposed in Fig. 3.
The hopping of carriers, including protons and Li’, through
functional groups and their trapping in the trapping-sites through
topological defects in the sidewall occur in the low-voltage region
(0-1.4V), as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The presence of the functional
groups and defects in the s-SWCNTs was confirmed by the XPS
spectra in Fig. 1d and the Raman spectrum in Fig. 2b. With the
increase in voltage, the intercalation of Li* in the s-SWCNTs
occurs, as shown in Fig. 3b, which leads to a reduction in carrier
concentration and mobility. Therefore, a decrease in the slope of
the IV characteristic was observed.

With the understanding of the working mechanism, a possible
artificial synapse, which can imitate the transmission of pain
signals, is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Similar to the post-synaptic
current dependent on the action potential in a biological system,
the post-synaptic current of the artificial synapse can also be
modulated by the stimuli of applied voltage pulses. First, the
plasticity characteristics of an artificial synapse stimulated by 100
consecutive pulses with an amplitude of 1V and pulse widths of

Fig.6 Emulation of the nerve injuries by mild and severe stimuli. a Response of the post-synaptic current to severe stimuli. The dash line
shows the threshold current for the functional loss of the nerve system. b-d The complete functional loss occurs and complete recovery

cannot be achieved for a long time.

5 ms, 10ms, and 30ms were investigated and are presented in
Fig. 4a—c, respectively. With the increase in pulse width, there was
an enhancement in synaptic potentiation, which corresponded to
the increase in the pain signal with the increase in external stimuli.
However, when the voltage increased to 3 V, interesting behaviors
were observed. The post-synaptic current increased dramatically
during the first several stimuli of 3 V over 10 ms. Then, it saturated
gradually, and a maximum current was obtained regardless of the
member of pulses, as shown in Fig. 4a. The behavior is related to
neuroprotection in cases of possible neuropathic injury of the
nervous system due to the stimuli. When the pulse width
increased to 30ms, a small decrease following the maximum
post-synaptic current was observed, as shown in Fig. 4b. The
decrease in current became more obvious when the pulse width
was further increased to 50 ms. In addition, fewer pulses were
required to achieve the maximum current as shown in Fig. 4c. The
accompanied injuries to the nervous system usually occurred in
these cases. Therefore, the presented potentiation and _ self-
limitation in the current show the potential for the emulation of
pain perception, neuroprotection, and injury to the nervous
system.

According to the grading systems developed by Seddon and
Sunderland, nerve injuries can be divided into three categories:
neurapraxia, axonotmesis, and neurotmesis based on the micro-
scopic changes and patient symptomatology**”*°. Neurapraxia, the
mildest injury as a result of a transient conduction block at the site
of injury, does not involve loss of nerve continuity and causes
functional loss. The injury can be self-recovered in a short time.
However, axonotmesis and neurotmesis usually refer to a severe
or complete interruption of the nerve axon or disconnection of a
nerve, which are caused by the occurrence of axon and myelin
degeneration distal to the point of injury or complete denervation.

npj Flexible Electronics (2020) 3

Functional loss occurs and surgical intervention is required for
recovery. A schematic diagram for mild and severe nerve injuries
is presented in Fig. 5a. The artificial synapse developed in this
study was employed to mimic and demonstrate the responses of
neural signals to pain sensation and possible nerve injuries
discussed above, which is the key component for the construction
of a bio-inspired perception system.

From the results in Fig. 4, it is clear that nerve injuries can be
induced only for stimuli with a large voltage, 3 Vin this study. If
the pulse voltage is 1V, a smooth increase in the post-synaptic
current is obtained, which indicates a potentiation of the artificial
synapse. Therefore, in this demonstration, stimuli with a voltage of
3V are used to generate different types of nerve injuries by
varying the pulse width. Successive pulses with a voltage of 1V
are employed to induce synaptic potentiation without causing
injury to the nervous system, and a voltage of 0.35 V is selected to
check the post-synaptic current when no stimuli are applied (a
discussion of the selection of 0.35 V as the voltage is presented in
Supplementary Fig. 11). Figure 5b-d show the transient-injury of
the artificial nerve stimulated by a series of mild pulses of 3 V over
10ms and its self-recovery process. Initially, repetitive synaptic
potentiation shows the proper function of the artificial synapse
without any injury, as indicated by | and Il in Fig. 5b. A saturation
of the neural signal is observed for the stimuli of 3V over 10 ms
(indicated by Ill), which leads to the abnormal behaviors in the
potentiation of the post-synaptic current (IV and V). Fortunately,
the transient injury can be self-recovered in a short time, <3 min in
this study. These processes resemble neurapraxia in biological
systems and can be used to mimic cases of paralysis or injury
caused by the mildest stimuli.

However, complete functional loss occurs if the artificial
synapse suffers from an acute painful stimulus. Additionally, the

Published in partnership with Nanjing Tech University
performance cannot be recovered to its initial state regardless of
the recovery time, which resembles axonotmesis and neurotmesis
in biological synapses. For the artificial synapse studied in this
research, the threshold current for the functional loss of the nerve
system is about 315 WA as indicated in Figs 5b and 6a. Figure 6
shows the emulation of this process by increasing the pulse width
of the stimuli to 30 ms. Figure 6(a-l) and (a-Il) show the synaptic
potentiation stimulated with pulses of 1 V over 30 ms. However, an
inhibition rather than potentiation in the post-synaptic current
occurs as the voltage increases to 3V over 30ms and
corresponding current reaches the threshold level, as shown in
Fig. 6 (a-lll), which is caused by the intercalation of Li* in s-
SWCNTs at relatively high voltage, as discussed in Fig. 4. The
functional loss lasts for several seconds (Fig. 6(a-IV) and (a-V)),
and complete recovery cannot be achieved for a long time, as
shown in Fig. 6b-d, which is similar to denervation due to axon
and myelin degeneration in biological systems.

DISCUSSIONS

In conclusion, a bio-inspired double-layer artificial synapse was
fabricated with s-SWCNTs and PEO: LiClO,. The device exhibits
synaptic potentiation in the low-voltage region and inhibition in
the high-voltage region towards the emulation of pain perception
and nerve injuries of living creatures. Physical and electrical
characterizations were carried out to provide evidence and
possible explanations for the working mechanism of the artificial
synapses. The results show that the underlying mechanism is
based on the hopping of carriers through functional groups and
the intercalation of Li in s-SWCNTs. Based on the fabricated
artificial synapses, neurapraxia, axonotmesis, and neurotmesis
caused by different nerve injuries were emulated. Overall, the
artificial synapse offers a new avenue for the construction of a bio-
inspired perception system, which provides a solution to the
intelligent human-machine interface.

METHODS

Fabrication of the flexible memristor-based artificial synapses
Diluted polyimide (Pl) solution was spin-coated on the cleaned glass and
cured at 300 °C for 1h. Then, the electrodes (Ti/Au) were deposited on the
PI substrates by sputtering and patterned using photolithograph and lift-
off method. After that, 90% s-SWCNTs (Nanolntegris) dispersed in dimethyl
formamide (DMF) was drop-casted on the sample at 50 °C followed by the
bake at 160°C for 1h and the AFM images in Supplementary Fig. 1a—c
show the carbon nanotube network deposited by various methods. The
active regions were defined using photolithograph and O, plasma etching
and IV characteristics before and after plasma etching are illustrated in
Supplementary Fig. 1d. Afterward, the PEO: LiClO, (10: 1) solution (5 uL)
was dropped on the top of active regions and baked 80°C for 30 min.
Finally, Pl membrane was peeled-off from the glass. The schematic
diagrams for the fabrication process are demonstrated in Supplementary
Fig. 2 of the supplement materials.

Device characterizations

The surface morphology of s-SWCNTs were investigated by AFM (Burker
Dimension). FTIR spectra were collected via a Thermo Nicolet iN
10 spectrometer with the laser working at 77Kin a liquid nitrogen
environment. XPS analysis was carried out using Thermo Scientific
EXCALAB 250 XI. All the electrical measurements were performed at
25°C and 40% humidity using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor
parameter analyzer.
