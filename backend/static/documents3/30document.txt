Full list of author information is and universities have failed to keep up with their learning needs. Consequently, large

available at the end of the article numbers of disabled students are dropping out of school or university. Open
Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practices (OEP) contain several
relevant features, including the possibility of reusing and remixing, which have led
researchers to consider using OER and OEP to facilitate meeting the needs of
disabled and functional-diverse students in order to increase their accessibility and
e-inclusion capabilities in educational settings. The very limited research to date,
however, has provided a limited holistic understanding of accessibility within OER
and OEP in order to aid researchers in pursuing future directions in this field.
Therefore, this paper systematically reviewed 31 papers to provide insights about
functional diversity within OER and OEP. The results obtained highlighted that
accessibility is still in its infancy within OER and that researchers should focus more
on considering the four accessibility principles — perceivable, operable,
understandable and robust — when providing OER. Additionally, while several
researchers have focused on several issues related to accessibility within OER, limited
focus has been given to assistive technologies using OER. Finally, this paper provides
several recommendations to increase accessibility within OER and help design more
accessible OER for students with functional diversity.

Abstract

Keywords: Open educational resources, Open educational practices, Accessibility,
Inclusion, Disability

 

Education is a key issue of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, being both
directly connected to the 17 goals of the agenda and at the core of Sustainable Develop-
ment Goal 4 (SDG4), which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and
promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (United Nations, 2015). One target of
SDG4 is equity, which is defined by its goal to, ‘by 2030, eliminate gender disparities in
education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for
the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in
vulnerable situations’ (United Nations, 2015, p. 17).

Open Educational Resources (OER), defined as ‘teaching, learning and research mate-
rials in any medium that may be composed of copyrightable materials released under an
open license, materials not protected by copyright, materials for which copyright protec-
tion has expired, or a combination of the foregoing’ (UNESCO, forthcoming), have the
potential to contribute to reaching this objective by increasing access to learning as well
as improving the quality of the learning experience (Ehlers, 2011). The OER movement is
based on the idea that educational resources (e.g., content or course designs) should be re-
leased under licenses that allow anyone to freely access, retain (e.g., download, duplicate,
store), reuse, revise (e.g., translate, adapt, modify), combine and-or re-share them (TIili,
Huang, Chang, Nascimbeni & Burgos, 2019). The use of OER for teaching in an innova-
tive and collaborative environment is referred to as Open Educational Practices (OEP).
Ehlers (2011), p. 4 defined OEP as ‘practices which support the (re)use and production of
Open Educational Resources through institutional policies, promote innovative
pedagogical models, and respect and empower learners as co-producers on their lifelong
learning paths’. Research is coalescing around the fact that these practices can help en-
hance learning quality, access and effectiveness in universities (Weller, 2014).

Despite the growing number of OER (Hoosen & Butcher, 2019) and the policy atten-
tion devoted to OER accessibility, as demonstrated by the presence of guidelines to
increase the accessibility of OER within the Ljubljana OER Action Plan (UNESCO,
2017), the extent to which OER are actually accessible is currently being questioned.
Accessibility refers to the use of a product, service, framework or resource in an
efficient, effective and satisfying way by people with different abilities ISO 9241-171,
2008). Functional diversity is a key issue in the development of any online resource, in-
cluding OER, since it is potentially focused on almost every single user. The approach
has moved from handicapped users (essentially, those with motor, cognitive or sensorial
impairments) through accessibility (improving specific issues to facilitate a better user
experience) to functional diversity and e-inclusion (of any feature of any user who
requires additional support, like the ones associated with elderly or those on sick leave)
(Iniesto, Covadonga, & Moreira Teixeira, 2014; Sanchez-Gordon & Lujan-Mora, 2013;
Tekleab, Karaca, Quigley, & Tsang, 2016).

The present paper aims to provide a holistic and systematic review of the literature in
the field of the accessibility and functional diversity of OER and OEP, as a valuable
guide for better designing open educational ecosystems that support inclusive learning,
improving the potential effect of OER on twenty-first century teaching and learning for
learners with different needs. This is particularly urgent since recent data estimates that
15% of world population — more than a billion people — live with some form of dis-
ability (World Health Organization and World Bank, 2011). The structure of the paper
is as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the research, section 3 details the re-
search method, section 4 presents and discusses the obtained results, and section 5
concludes the paper with a summary of the findings, limitations and potential future

directions.

Background
According to the World Health Organization, disability cover[s] impairments, activity
limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function

or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in
Zhang et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:1 Page 3 of 19

executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by
an individual in involvement in life situations. (World Health Organization, 2015).

The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education defines
‘accessible’ as meaning that a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to
acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same
services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated
manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

In educational contexts, accessibility for disabled students means that, in order for all
to have equitable learning experiences, the learning experience, including its learning
content and teaching process, should be adjusted according to students’ needs, includ-
ing their disabilities. While people with disabilities have the same educational needs as
others, they are less likely to attend schools and graduate, and consequently may face
difficulties in finding jobs in future (Ingram, 1971; Iwarsson & Stahl, 2003; World
Health Organization and World Bank, 2011). Various international policies, including
the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015)
and the UNESCO Education for All initiative (UNESCO, 1990), have highlighted the
importance of providing fair learning experiences for all students regardless of their
differences. Still, a great proportion of schools and universities fail to properly address
equitable access, especially with regard to disabled students (Catlin & Blamires, 2019),
partly due to the lack of effective teaching methods and content targeted to these
student categories (Virnes, 2008).

In the area of web accessibility, several standards released by the Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3) can be applied to OER.
Among these standards, WCAG 2.0 has been widely accepted and adopted (W3C.,
2012) and is based on four attributes that lay the necessary foundations for anyone to
access and use websites, as shown in Table 1. Based on these four attributes, 12 guide-
lines and 61 success criteria are provided, categorised into three levels of conformance:
AAA (highest), AA or A (lowest) (Crespo, Espada, & Burgos, 2016; W3, 2008).

Table 1 shows that OER can increase the accessibility of web-based education in
many ways. This potential is mainly connected to the inner OER features of re-using,
remixing and redistributing learning content that can help adapt existing materials to
disabled students without having to develop resources from scratch. OER can serve the
needs of those with diverse abilities for a number of complementary reasons:

e Permissions granted by an open license remove legal barriers to adapting and
customising OER, making it possible to create learning environments that are more
flexible and robust for all students.

e OER offer the opportunity for instructors to curate materials authored by a
diverse set of individuals, including those who identify as disabled, normalising
and reducing stigma while sharing viewpoints that have historically been
marginalised.

e Unlike commercially published materials, OER that are adapted to meet
accessibility requirements can be retained and freely shared with communities,
reducing duplicative work at and across institutions.

e OER adoption can reduce costs, which benefits all students but can be especially
beneficial for students with disabilities who may face additional financial pressures.

e It is more common for OER to be shared in formats that can be adapted for
accessibility, unlike proprietary publisher content, from whom editable files are
notably difficult to obtain (Thomas, 2018).

Hejer, Khribi, and Jemni (2017) mentioned that despite the fact that the OER
paradigm can facilitate inclusive learning by reusing the open resources in a way which
caters to the needs of disabled students, limited work has been done to achieve this
purpose. Similarly, Iniesto, McAndrew, Minocha, and Coughlan (2017) stated that few
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are fully accessible for disabled students.
Undeniably, not enough research is being conducted to support inclusive and equitable
learning using OER (Navarrete, Pefafiel, Tenemaza, & Lujan-Mora, 2019). Specifically,
to our knowledge, only one conference paper has conducted a systematic literature
review to investigate the actual accessibility of OER for disabled learners (Moreno,
Caro, & Cabedo, 2018), providing only information about the trends of OER and
accessibility without summarising and discussing findings related to accessible learning
within OER and OEP. In addition, while several literature reviews have been conducted
to better understand the use of OER for the general student population, no literature
review has focused on investigating the work done on the accessibility of OER and
OEP. To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review to understand
how the application of OER and OEP can increase learning accessibility.

Methodology

A rigorous literature review is an important step that builds the foundation for know-
ledge accumulation, which in turn facilitates the expansions and improvements of
theories, closes existing gaps in research and uncovers areas previous research has
missed (Maranguni¢ & Grani¢, 2015). This study presents a systematic review based on
published papers related to OER and OEP for learning accessibility, with particular ref-
erence to disabled students. It follows the steps reported by Okoli and Schabram
(2010) as described in the next subsequent sections.

Investigated research questions
To gain insight into the use of OER and OEP for accessible learning, a systematic review

is needed. Specifically, this study attempts to answer the following research questions:

RQ1. What are the trends in publications on learning accessibility using OER and OEP
in terms of time series, country and keyword distribution?

RQ2. What kinds of disabilities and issues were investigated in the identified papers?
RQ3. Which assessment methodologies were used in the identified papers?

Search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria

To answer the above research questions, several keywords were adopted as follows:
accessib* AND Open AND Educational Resource*, accessib* AND OER, accessib* AND
Open Educational Resource, accessib* AND OEP, accessib* AND Open Pedagogy,
accessib* AND Open teaching, accessib* AND Open assessment, accessib* AND Open
educational Practices, Inclusive learning AND Open educational resource, Inclusive learn-
ing AND OER. The search was conducted in several databases, including ScienceDirect,
Wiley Online Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Core Collections of Web of Science
and Taylor & Francis Online. ResearchGate, a network for researchers to share, discover
and discuss research, was also used to retrieve the related papers. The obtained papers
were then filtered based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Specifically, we excluded
papers that: (1) were not in English; (2) did not discuss openness using OER and OEP for
learning accessibility; (3) did not focus on disabled students; or (4) did not have available
full-text online. A total of thirty-one papers were finally included during the review
process. Figure 1 presents the selection procedure of papers during this review process.

Data extraction and analysis

Each study was then reviewed and examined based on seven items, as presented in Table 2.
These items provide information to answer the above research questions and conduct the
synthesis. Finally, a qualitative synthesis was conducted to answer the research questions.

programmes. In particular, the authors focused on open software because by nature it

can be modified and adapted to different needs, fulfilling more accessibility require-

ments than proprietary software (Klironomos, Antona, Basdekis, & Stephanidis, 2006).

Since then, experts have realised the importance and necessity of research on the topic of

accessibility and open education, intended here as education based on OER and OEP.

Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, the interest in open education for disabled students has in-
creased since 2014; the number of related papers published in 2014, 2015 and 2016

accounted for more than 60% of all the production of the last decade. Additionally, the
year 2016 saw a peak in interest in this area, probably connected with the fact that the
UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was launched in 2015, providing an im-
petus for research in the areas of accessibility and inclusion.

Distribution by country

The distribution of the first author’s countries is presented in Fig. 3, showing that
authors from only nine countries have led research about OER and OEP for accessible
learning. This shows that the use of OER and OEP for inclusive learning is still in its
infancy and that more awareness should be raised to encourage further investigation in
this field. In particular, authors from Ecuador had 11 papers related to this topic,

accounting for more than one third of all papers, followed by Spain, with six papers.
Ecuador is indeed considered as a leading country in the field of disability support,
since the government proposed in 2007 several policies to address the needs, including
educational needs, of disabled persons. Spain has long attached great importance to
inclusive education; as early as 1982, Spain passed legislation to integrate disabled youth
in schools. In 1985 the decree on special education moved many disabled children from
special schools to mainstream schools. In 1994, the United Nations World Conference on
Special Needs Education was held in Spain, where the fundamental principle of inclusion
at school was declared and widely endorsed. Interestingly, four out of the nine countries
present at that conference (Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK) have adopted the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) noted earlier (W3, 2017).

Distribution by keyword

Finally, the keyword distribution of the 31 research papers in the systematic review was
analysed in order to understand the use of OER and OEP for accessible learning more
deeply. Keywords with similar meanings, such as ‘OER’ and ‘Open Educational Resources’
or ‘Learning object’ and ‘LO’, were normalised. The final distribution of the keywords is
presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen that accessibility, OER and disability are the most com-
monly used keywords in the 31 papers reviewed. In particular, disability and accessibility
focus on the category of students on which these research papers focus, while OER focus
on the category of education that can contribute to improving the accessibility of earning
opportunities. Importantly, we discovered that the term Open Educational Practices
(OEP), as well as sub-terms, such as open pedagogy, open teaching and open assessment,
have not yet been discussed in the literature when it comes to accessible learning. There-
fore, in the subsequent analysis we will focus only on accessibility and OER.

Disabilities and issues investigated
As shown in Table 3, when investigating the use of OER, researchers focused on several
disabilities, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, motor disabilities, speech

disabilities, cognitive disabilities and aging-connected disabilities. Researchers paid almost

equal attention to different types of disability, including seven studies on visual disabilities
and hearing disabilities, respectively, and six papers on motor disabilities and cognitive
disabilities. It is obvious that aging also imposes certain limitations on the ability of
humans, so researchers have also considered it. It should be noted that some papers
discussed more than one disability. For instance, Zervas et al. (2014) developed an online
teaching and learning portal for students with visual and/or hearing disabilities.

The use of OER to address the above disabilities was discussed from five different
angles: system design, personalisation, metadata, authoring tools and OER accessibility
framework/architecture. As shown in Table 4, most authors focused on system design to
increase accessibility and usability for students with disabilities. For instance, Ngubane-
Mokiwa (2016) conducted a literature review and identified several guidelines to facilitate
MOOC access for visually impaired students. These guidelines are from three different
perspectives: (1) multiple means of representation, which focuses on the strategies to
make MOOCs accessible; (2) multiple means of action and expression, which focuses on
the strategies that facilitates user actions on MOOCs; and, (3) multiple means of engage-
ment, which focuses on strategies to provide accessible interaction within MOOCs.

Several researchers also analysed personalised learning experiences based on the ‘type of
disability’ or ‘user profile’ as a personalisation parameter. For instance, Zervas et al. (2014)
designed an OER-based educational portal to facilitate learning and teaching for students
with different disabilities, including those with visually impairments. Similarly, Navarrete
and Lujan-Mora (2018) developed an OER website that takes into consideration the dis-
ability of students, including visual and hearing disabilities, as a personalisation parameter.
This “disability-personalisation’ path is extremely relevant, as recognised by the National
Academy of Engineering, which mentioned that personalised learning is one of the four-
teen most important challenges of the twenty-first xentury (Tlili, et al., 2019).

Other researchers focused on discussing metadata, defined and machine-processable
data that describe resources, either digital or nondigital (Haslhofer & Klas, 2010), in
inclusive learning using OER and OEP. An accurate metadata set can enhance the
retrieval of educational resources and provide a friendly navigation experience. For
instance, in order to better describe and identify resources, Navarrete and Lujan-Mora
(2018) applied a subset of descriptors from the Learning Object Metadata (LOM)
standards. Similarly, Navarrete and Lujan-Mora (2014) applied other metadata
standards, including DCMI (Dublin Core Metadata initiative) and AfA (Access for All).
Some researchers have put forward innovative frameworks to improve the accessibility
of OER. Rodriguez et al. (2017) argued that the development of a framework for
improving web accessibility should be based on existing standards, such as WCAG 2.0,
and proposed a framework for enhancing the accessibility and usability of open
courseware sites. Innovative architectures are also presented by Sanchez-Gordon and
Lujan-Mora (2016) as ways to improve the accessibility of MOOCs and OER.

Finally, some researchers have focused on developing authoring tools for accessible
OER. For instance, Mulwa et al. (2016) developed an OER authoring tool to facilitate the
creation of OER for students with visual disabilities by selecting the navigation methods
and text sizes. As shown in Table 4, only two papers focused on authoring tools to de-
velop accessible OER. This might explain the limited number of fully accessible OER.
Therefore, more focus should be put on developing tools that can help educators create
and publish OER for disabled students. Additionally, no reviewed paper discussed the ac-
cessibility of OER from the assistive technology perspective. Given that different assistive
technologies for disabled persons exist within different Operating Systems (OS), OER de-
signers should try to make their resources compatible with as many assistive technologies

and OS as possible in order to ensure high accessibility.

Assessment methodologies used

Based on the review of the 31 identified studies, 16 papers conducted assessments to
evaluate the accessibility of OER, while the 15 remaining papers did not conduct any
assessment. Specifically, to assess the accessibility of OER, three different methods were
Zhang et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:1 Page 11 of 19

used, as shown in Table 5: automatic tools, simulator tools and manual assessment. In

aDesigner, used by Iniesto and Rodrigo (2014) and Iniesto et al. (2014), aimed to simu-
late the use by people with visual disabilities in order to help the designer assess the ex-
tent to which a given content is accessible to users with that particular disability.
Finally, manual assessment is mostly based on users’ questionnaires (Avila Garzon,
2018; Avila Garzon et al., 2016; Caruso & Ferlino, 2009; Mulwa et al., 2016; Navarrete
et al., 2019; Navarrete & Lujan-Mora, 2015a; Navarrete & Lujan-Mora, 2018; Rodriguez
et al., 2017; Sanchez-Gordon & Lujan-Mora, 2016). In these cases, the purpose of the
questionnaire is to obtain a qualitative analysis to appreciate the users’ experience of
the process of using a given OER (Navarrete et al., 2019), based on questions like ‘Is it
easy to learn how to use the website?’ or ‘Can the user resolve the tasks on the website
without unnecessary effort?’ (Navarrete & Lujan-Mora, 2018). Several researchers, how-
ever, claimed that using questionnaires may not be motivating for learners, since they
are typically too long. Additionally, learners may not fully reveal their experiences and
may try to respond optimistically when they feel that they are being assessed by others
(Okada & Oltmanns, 2009). To counterbalance these attitudes, given the rapid growth
of technology and the era of big data and learning analytics, researchers should focus
more on using the data generated by learners to obtain insights about the accessibility
of OER-based learning processes. If we consider that the accessibility of OER and OEP
should aim at enabling all users, including disabled ones, having equitable learning
opportunities, this focus on technical accessibility suggests that the research on OER
and OEP for disabled learners is still in its infancy, since most researchers have focused
on a rather superficial analysis that does not rely on rich datasets. Therefore, further
research should be conducted to investigate how OER and OEP facilitate the deploy-
ment of accessible and inclusive learning from a more holistic perspective.

WCAG 2.0 provides guidelines on how to make web content more accessible to
people with disabilities and four principles to lay the foundation of Web accessibility
(W3, 2008). Table 6 presents the results of the review along with the four accessibility
attributes presented in the Background section: perceivable, operable, understandable
and robust. It appears that the majority of researchers discussed accessibility as one
concept without considering specific accessibility attributes. Table 6 shows that the
general OER accessibility level could be improved: among the 16 papers which reported
accessibility assessment results, 15 generally agreed that there was much room for
improvement in the accessibility of OER, especially for disabled users. For instance, the
accessibility evaluation results by Iniesto and Rodrigo (2014) show a low degree of
compliance of the analysed OER with the WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines. Navarrete
et al. (2019) also conclude that neither the OER website interface nor the educational
resources are fully accessible.

If we analyse the accessibility attributes individually, Rodriguez and Pérez (2017)
stated that more errors are found under the attributes ‘robust’ and ‘perceivable’, which
account for 50% and 31.81%, respectively, of the errors made when using the automatic
tool TAW. On the other hand, for the attributes ‘operable’ and ‘understandable’, the
percentage of errors is 20% and 17.64%, respectively. After accessibility evaluation with
TAW of four OER platforms, including MERLOT, OCW UPM, OER COMMONS and
OLI, similar results were reported in Navarrete and Lujan-Mora (2015c), which showed
that the greatest number of warnings are annotated under the attributes ‘robust’ and
‘perceivable’, while all of these warnings may be related to some issues that need to be

bute ‘understandable’.

Conclusion, recommendations and future directions
This study presented a systematic review of the use of OER and OEP to provide
accessible learning. The final notes based on the results discussed above (in the three

presented research questions) are as follows:

e A limited number of countries (nine) were involved in the investigation of the use
of OER and OEP for accessible learning (research question 1). Therefore,
researchers worldwide should be encouraged to get involved in this research field.
This can be changed by raising awareness about the new opportunities that OER
and OEP could provide to disabled students for effective accessible learning, or by
launching new projects or policies (e.g., governmental or institutional) that
encourage the use of OER and OEP for inclusive learning.

e Only two papers discussed the development of authoring tools with features to
create accessible content, which might explain the reasons for having limited online
OER and OEP for disabled students (research question 2). This should be changed
by developing more inclusive authoring tools (that work with different functional
diversities) that educators can use to create and publish open content.

e Most assessments conducted focused only on the accessibility of the provided OER
(research question 3). Therefore, more research should also be conducted to
investigate the effectiveness of OER and OEP in providing accessible learning
experiences and enhancing disabled students’ learning achievements.

e There is still much room for improvement in OER accessibility (research question 3).
Therefore, researchers and practitioners should consider different accessibility
guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.0) while developing their OER platforms, tools and devices.
This helps provide an effective approach to accessibility, functional diversity and e-
inclusion in educational settings.

e Only three assessment methods are used: automatic tools, simulator tools and
manual tools (research question 3). Therefore, in the era of big data, researchers
and practitioners should also begin applying learning analytics for more accurate
assessment of the accessible learning experience provided to disabled and
functional-impaired students.

e Among the four accessibility attributes, ‘robust’ has the highest percentage of errors
(research question 3). Therefore, OER developers should place more emphasis on
OER’s compatibility with most assistive devices, as well as operating systems
(Windows, Mac OSX and Linux).

In addition, the authors consider direct support to educators a key issue, so that they
learn the foundations of functional diversity, develop the skill set to operate learning
resources under these terms and are fully aware of the significance of and need for
specific actions around the topic. Indeed, providing specific competencies and training
for educators are a challenge but nonetheless a required measure to improve the
impact of functional diversity and accessibility on the educational system.
Zhang et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:1 Page 17 of 19

This study opens new research perspectives for researchers and practitioners on the
use of open educational resources and practices for accessibility and functional diversity
in educational contexts by uncovering gaps in this field that should be investigated.
This study has several limitations, however, that should be acknowledged. For instance,
the review results are limited to the search keywords used: thus, some studies may not
be included. This study is also based on findings from the literature review and is not
supported by any experimental setup. Despite these limitations, this study provides a
solid ground from which to explore the use of open educational resources and practices

in this context.
