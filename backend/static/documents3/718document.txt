Rapid micro-immunohistochemistry

Robert D. Lovchik', David Taylor@'? and Govind Kaigala®

Abstract
We present a new and versatile implementation of rapid and localized immunohistochemical staining of tissue
sections. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) comprises a sequence of specific biochemical reactions and allows the
detection of specific proteins in tissue sections. For the rapid implementation of IHC, we fabricated horizontally
oriented microfluidic probes (MFPs) with functionally designed apertures to enable square and circular footprints,
which we employ to locally expose a tissue to time-optimized sequences of different biochemicals. We show that the

two main incubation steps of IHC protocols can be performed on MDAMB468-1510A cell block sections in less than
30 min, compared to incubation times of an hour or more in standard protocols. IHC analysis on the timescale of tens
of minutes could potentially be applied during surgery, enabling clinicians to react in more dynamically and efficiently.
Furthermore, this rapid IHC implementation along with conservative tissue usage has strong potential for the
implementation of multiplexed assays, allowing the exploration of optimal assay conditions with a small amount of
tissue to ensure high-quality staining results for the remainder of the sample.

Introduction

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a_ well-established
technique to detect the spatial distribution of antigens
in tissue sections and is now routinely used for tumor
analysis in research laboratories and diagnostic centers.
Interestingly, this method has been used for well over 50
years with limited modifications to the underlying prin-
ciple, owing to its robustness. In contrast, it has under-
gone several innovations in implementation, automation
and throughput. With each innovation, user input has
been reduced, but often at the expense of flexibility and
versatility.

After sample-dependent pretreatment, in the first step
of an IHC assay, a primary antibody, which specifically
binds to an antigen of interest, is applied to the tissue. In
the second step, a secondary antibody is applied. The
secondary antibody, which helps to amplify the detection
signal, is usually polyclonal and conjugated with enzymes
that enable subsequent detection of the signal through

colorimetric reactions. This series of incubation steps
allows antigen localization through the choice of antibody
and control over the reaction kinetics, thus aiding semi-
quantitative or quantitative estimation of the amounts of
antigen present in the sample. The commercially sourced
antibodies in these protocols often vary in their specificity
and sensitivity, thus requiring meticulous optimization
and testing’. Hence, there is a need to enable users to
rapidly screen parameter spaces to determine practical
assay conditions for the specific biochemicals used. The
ability to quantitatively characterize detected signals,
perform multiplexed detection of various antigens simul-
taneously, and rapidly implement IHC protocols that are
standardized or modified according to user need are facets
of research that would be essential to fostering the next
generation of methods in cancer research and diagnostics.

Several notable efforts have been made to enable a
quantitative proteomic assessment of tissue sections via
IHC, for example, Dupouy et al.”, Carvajal-Hausdorf
et al.*, and Xing et al.*. In our previous work, Kashyap
et al.°, using a microfluidic probe, we introduced a
method for the implementation of IHC as a quantitative
assay (quIC). Our quIC method looks at the evolution of
the signal strength to extract quantitative information.

The current design of the MFP devices that we present
here could also be used for quIC. To broaden the
applicability of the MFP, this work shows how we
increased the rapidity of IHC and implemented sequential
chemistry in small and defined regions of tissues. Sig-
nificant improvements in the speed and reproducibility of
these assays remain essential for rendering quantitative
IHC useful in a routine clinical context.

Numerous methods have also been proposed for
implementing multiplexed IHC analysis. These are
broadly classified as follows: 1. Application of different
primary antibodies to the same region of a tissue. To avoid
cross-reactivity in the detection step, primary antibodies
must be produced in different species, which greatly limits
the number of antigens that can be detected simulta-
neously”. This constraint can be relaxed by stripping
antibodies deposited in a previous analysis and by
bleaching the resulting detection signal prior to per-
forming a subsequent test. This sequential stripping and
bleaching is laborious, time-consuming and, importantly,
tends to deteriorate the tissue. 2. The layered peptide
arrays technique, where the antigens are blotted onto
several layers of stacked membranes, which allows inde-
pendent analysis of each membrane subsequently while
preserving the spatial information of the obtained IHC
data®. Although suitable for multiplexing, this approach is
complex and consumes the tissue section entirely. 3.
Spatial segregation to present different primary antibodies
on a tissue section, which allows the use of any type of
antibody on neighboring reaction sites’. Depending on
the resolution of the spatial confinement of the corre-
sponding antibody solutions, this allows the mapping of
specific regions of interest (ROIs) in a multiplexed man-
ner. This implementation overcomes several of the lim-
itations of other implementations described above by
obviating harsh chemical stripping or adding complexity
to the IHC protocol.

One potential strategy for spatially segregated multi-
plexing is to implement co-flow laminar streams of anti-
body solutions in open-top microchannels pressed onto a
tissue section, as reported by Kim et al.® and Ciftlik
et al.’. The required mechanical contact with the tissue
sections nevertheless consumes parts of the sample and
offers limited flexibility in terms of addressing specific
ROIs on the tissue section, which becomes critical when
the ROIs are very small in comparison with the total
tissue area. A versatile and IHC-compatible strategy is
to localize antibody solutions in a so-called hydro-
dynamic flow confinement (HFC) formed at the apex of
a noncontact liquid scanning probe, such as a micro-
fluidic probe (MEP)'®. Multiplexed IHC routines using
an MEP were demonstrated by Lovchik et al.’ and
Queval et al.'’ at the micrometer scale and expanded to
the centimeter scale by Taylor et al.'*. Such flow-based

Page 2 of 10

approaches were also used for brain slice micro-
environment modification’’ and breast cancer sec-
tions”, as well as in combination with lanthanide-based
immunocomplexes'* and immunofluorescence’~.

Another important aspect pertaining to IHC analysis is
the total time required to implement the complete assay.
In traditional IHC, the incubation time of each antibody is
~30-60 min, sometimes longer, even overnight. This step
significantly contributes to the total time required for an
IHC test. In earlier work, we presented micrometer-scale
IHC’, in which we implemented the highly localized
delivery of primary antibodies on tissue sections with an
MFP. The time required for the presentation of the pri-
mary antibody to each area of the section was in the range
of ~30-60s. This microfluidic approach, allowing a
reduction in the incubation times, was enabled by two
advantages: (a) only small volumes of liquids are con-
sumed, allowing the concentration of antibodies to be
increased without increasing the cost of the assay, and (b)
the flow of the antibody solution allows the continuous
replenishment of the antibodies consumed from the
solution, thereby making the reaction time largely inde-
pendent of the relatively low diffusion coefficients of the
antibodies. Apart from our demonstration of expanding
MFP-assisted IHC from the micrometer scale to the
centimeter scale, Taylor et al.'’, a related publication by
Cors et al.’° additionally showed the integration of
dewaxing and rehydration with an MFP to further
increase the rapidity of multiplexed IHC staining.

The challenge faced in our and others’ prior work was
that processing the whole slide for the standard IHC
workflow, with the MFP performing only one of the steps,
made later use of the slides for other assays challenging. In
this paper, we focus on taking advantage of an MFP to
boost the rapidity of the assay by enhancing the reaction
rates and automation by rapid switching between different
types of processing liquids, allowing the fast imple-
mentation of sequential assay steps (see Fig. 1). We fur-
ther demonstrate different ways of performing sequential
chemistry with an MFP to integrate the whole workflow,
such that other assays might be run concomitantly, prior
to any whole slide processing. The rapidity of the assay
and localization of the applied liquids allow efficient
optimization of the processing parameters, using only a
small fraction of the tissue. We designed a new horizon-
tally oriented MFP head with apertures that enable the
implementation of arbitrarily shaped footprints (see Fig. 2).
Radial and square-shaped flow confinements were chosen,
which are well suited for sequential presentation of dif-
ferent liquids on surfaces from the micrometer to milli-
meter scale. Such radial or square-shaped HFCs are
formed by the central injection of a processing liquid,
which is reaspirated by surrounding ring- or square-
shaped apertures. We chose to locally implement the

three core steps of an IHC routine using horizontal
probe heads: the application of the primary antibody,
the secondary antibody and the enzyme (peroxidase).
These three steps largely determine the quality of the
obtained stain and usually require from 30min up to
several hours in on-bench protocols. Owing to
convection-enhanced deposition and the possibility of
using higher concentrations of antibodies without
increasing the overall consumption of reagents, the MFP
is well suited to locally implement these core steps of
IHC analysis within minutes; we refer to this method as
“rapid wIHC”.

Theory

The most important steps in IHC staining protocols are
the incubation of the tissue with primary and secondary
antibodies. Here, we show the dependency of the IHC
signal on multiple parameters. The amount of antibodies
binding to receptors on the surface of the sample b(t)
depends on several parameters. The value of interest, to
be semiquantitatively assessed by an IHC staining routine,
is the surface density of binding sites b,,. Further factors
that can be adjusted to optimize the assay conditions of an
MEFP-based staining protocol are the composition of the

buffer, the temperature 7, the bulk concentration of the
antibodies in the processing liquid co, the flow velocity of
the processing liquid (a function of the injection and
aspiration flow rates, Q; and Q,, and the gap distance d),
as well as the incubation time ¢;,-. In contrast, the intrinsic
properties of the applied antibodies, namely, the associa-
tion and dissociation constants with their respective target
Kon and kog and their diffusivity D,p, are not directly
optimizable and are subject to significant batch-to-batch
variations and variability caused by varying storage con-
ditions and other factors'®"”.

To estimate the impact of a change in Kon, e.g., of the
primary antibody, we assume that, due to convection
inherent to the MFP, the binding of antibodies to the
sample is reaction limited and D,, can, therefore, be
neglected. We also assume that all the involved species are
first-order reactants, and the receptor ligand binding
reaction at the sample, therefore, follows a Hill-Langmuir
characteristic. In such a scenario, the rate of the surface
reaction is

As the variation in the performance of applied anti-
bodies is found to have a large impact on the outcome of
IHC assays, there is a strong need for a reliable way to
validate antibodies under representative conditions to
ensure consistency of results*’.

Materials and methods
Microfluidic probe head fabrication

The microfluidic heads are hybrid Si/glass devices fab-
ricated using a sequence of standard microfabrication
steps: photolithography, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE),
anodic bonding, and dicing. The design of the MFP heads
was created in L-Edit V2016.2 (Tanner EDA), and the
masks for photolithography were written on a laser writer
(DWL 2000, Heidelberg Instruments, Germany). DRIE
(AMS-200SE, Alcatel Micro Machining Systems, France)
was performed on a double-side polished 4-inch Si wafer
(500 um thick, Siltronix, Geneva Switzerland) to pattern
the microchannels, the through-etched apertures and the
mesa of the MFP heads. The microchannels were etched
to a depth of 50um. All three etching steps also con-
tributed to patterning the outline of the hexagonal shape
of the MFP heads. Si bridges were left to stand around the
outline to keep the parts in place for further processing
steps (more details in the SI). A 4-inch glass wafer (1 mm,
Borofloat 33, SCHOTT AG, Germany) was used to fab-
ricate the upper part of the head. Prior to anodically
bonding the glass wafer to the patterned Si wafer, 500 um
vias were drilled on a CNC milling machine (Wissner
Gamma 303, Goettingen Germany) using a diamond drill
(Haefeli AG, Switzerland). Wafer-level anodic bonding
took place on a custom-made bonding machine (475 °C,
1.3kV). After dicing, the temporary Si bridges were
removed using a scalpel blade.

Fabrication and setting up the microfluidic probe station

A custom holder was built to mount the MFP head and
connect it to the pumping system (Fig. 2). The holder was
assembled from several machined pieces and attached to
the z-axis of an XYZ scanning system placed on an
inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon Instruments,
Japan) (see SI1). The MFP head was mounted as follows:
(1) The head was positioned in the holder (aluminum). (2)
The PDMS gasket (molded from Sylgard® 184) was placed
on the head. The PDMS gasket self-aligned with the holder
to match the holes to the via in the head. (3) A pressing
block (PMMA) with holes for the capillaries, was placed
on top of the gasket. The capillaries were inserted at the
positions matching the microchannels in the head. (4) A
bridge comprising a resilient pressure piece was mounted
to the frame of the holder, and the resilient pressure piece
was screwed towards the pressing block (finger-tight). This
force compressed the gasket to lock the capillaries in place
and ensure a leak-free connection (Figs. 2 and SI3).

With the MFP head mounted, the system was aligned to
ensure coparallelism between the scanning stage XY
movement, the substrate and the head surface by placing a
dummy glass slide (Menzel, Germany) and adjusting the
tilt of the head and substrate while establishing the zero
Z-position at different positions on the slide repeatedly.
Finding the zero Z-position was done by slowly moving
the head towards the glass slide and observing the
appearance of Newton’s rings between the head’s apex
and the glass.

Finite-element modeling

We performed steady-state three-dimensional (3D)
simulations with COMSOL Multiphysics (version 4.2).
Nonslip boundary conditions were defined on all surfaces,
constant flow velocity boundary conditions were applied
at the aperture, and a constant pressure boundary con-
dition was applied at the virtual interface between the
liquid in the gap and the surrounding liquid at the edges
of the apex. All fluids were designated as water (incom-
pressible Newtonian fluid with a density of 998 kg/m? and
a dynamic viscosity of 0.001Ns/m’). The ratio of
aspiration flow to injection flow was kept at 2.5, with an
aspiration flow rate of 10 uL/min.

Micro-immunohistochemistry (ulHC) protocol

(1) Sample preparation: MDAMB468-1510A cell block
sections were purchased from AMS Biotechnology
Europe (Massagno, Switzerland). A standard
protocol was applied to the cell block sections to
prepare the sample for the IHC experiment. The
preparation involved deparaffinization, hydrogen
peroxidase block, target retrieval and protein block
(see SI4 for more details on the protocol). The
prepared cell block sections were kept in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C for no
longer than one day until use.

(2) MFP system setup: Two glass slides were placed
into the substrate carrier next to each other. This
allowed the fluidic system to be adjusted to achieve
stable flow confinements on a dummy glass slide
before performing experiments on the sample glass
slide. The injection channels of the system were
initially purged with colored liquids (diluted food
colorant) until stable flow confinements were
observed on the dummy glass slide. The pressure
settings for each channel were saved in the control
software to enable rapid switching between flow
confinements with different reagents.

(3) IHC: The MFP head was moved to the sample
glass slide, which was covered with PBS, and
positioned away from the cell block section at a
safe distance (e.g., 15 mm). The substrate-to-head
Lovchik et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:94

gap distance was set to 75 um. The reservoir tubes
containing food colorant were replaced with tubes
containing the reagents for IHC (primary antibody,
secondary antibody and for some experiments
streptavidin peroxidase and DAB substrate). The
primary antibody (ab122898, anti-P53) as well as
the other IHC chemicals (Mouse-specific HRP/
DAB (ABC) Detection IHC Kit, ab64259) were
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Each
injection channel was purged with the
corresponding IHC reagent until no residual food
coloring could be observed. The pressure settings
for stable flow confinements and switching between
liquids were adjusted if needed. The MFP head was
then moved to the X and Y zero positions in
relation to the cell block section (upper left corner
of an imaginary square fitted around the circular
cell block section). This starting point for the
experiment was set to 0 for the x and y-axes in the
control software.

(4) Design of experiments for uIHC conditions: Rapid
uIHC with varying incubation times of the reagents
was performed by moving to _ designated
coordinates over the cell block section and
switching between the reagent injection channels
while keeping the aspiration flow constant. For
scanning LIHC, the MFP head was moved along the
row of flow confinements at constant velocities.
After applying the reagents with the MFP, the
sample was processed for the subsequent steps
according to a conventional IHC method.
Depending on the number of reagents applied
with the MFP, the cell block sections were
incubated with streptavidin peroxidase and DAB
substrate or with DAB substrate alone. No further
treatment was needed for the cell block sections
after scanning UIHC. Processed cell block sections
were dehydrated and mounted using standard
mounting medium and a coverslip.

Imaging and data processing

An upright microscope (Eclipse 90i, Nikon Instruments,
Japan) was used to image the sections, and color photo-
graphs were taken of each sample at x4 and x10 magni-
fication. Quantification of the staining intensity was
performed using ImageJ. Features were extracted manu-
ally, as this was considered sufficient for the con-
ceptualization shown here. The individual images were
analyzed as follows: (1) at least 25 nuclei per spot were
selected with the freehand selection tool, and the mean
gray value was calculated from all areas; (2) the same
procedure was performed to calculate the mean gray value
of the cytoplasm of the cells, where at least 25 regions per
spot were selected manually for analysis. The normalized

Page 6 of 10

stain intensity per spot was then determined by sub-
tracting the two values.

Results and discussion
Horizontally oriented microfluidic probe heads for
sequential chemistry

In Lovchik et al.’, we demonstrated multiplexed pIHC
on tissue sections within a single core of a tissue micro-
array. In that work, we implemented a single step of the
uIHC process by locally presenting the primary Ab solu-
tion to the tissue with a vertically oriented MFP head
using the basic configuration of an HFC formed via two
square-shaped apertures. While this was a stride forward
in performing local wlHC, significant challenges
remained: how to sequentially present multiple liquids to
a small region of a tissue to implement a complete IHC
protocol and how to increase the rapidity in the imple-
mentation of the complete protocol. The ability to switch
between reagents can of course be extended to alternating
between different primary antibodies for multiplexed
analysis. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a new class
of horizontally oriented MFP heads that not only allows
the elegant implementation of efficient sequential proto-
cols using multiple processing liquids but also provides
flexibility in the placement of the apertures relative to
each other and offers freedom in designing the apertures.
The horizontal arrangement of the new generation of
MFP heads provides room for the fluidic routing required
for switching between different processing liquids and
allows the deliberate shaping of apertures to enable the
creation of different shapes of the confined liquids.

A challenge related to the horizontal orientation of the
MFP heads is the resulting large surface area of the probe
head. It increases the risk of damaging the sample due to
improper alignment of the probe head with reference to the
tissue section. We mitigate this issue by forming a 50 um
high mesa at the center of the probe head, in which the
apertures are placed and which is then closer to the sample,
while the distance to the sample is larger for the remaining
area of the probe head. There are several noteworthy
aspects to the new head designs: (i) Different flow con-
finement geometries are feasible on account of the flexibility
of placement and shape of the apertures (square, circle,
etc.). (ii) The circular arrangement of the apertures helps to
minimize the cross-influence between adjacent HFCs, for
which the earlier approach was to have additional stabili-
zation apertures/flows, Taylor et al.’”. (iii) Owing to central
injection and side aspiration, the device can work in a more
stable manner for larger substrate-to-head distances.

The spacing between the apertures was designed to
minimize cross-talk between the different flow confine-
ments when running simultaneously. This was done by
performing finite-element simulations for both the cir-
cular and square-shaped HFCs (see Fig. 2c). An important
Lovchik et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:94

aspect of the simulations was to ensure that the HFCs are
in contact throughout the entire desired processing
footprint on the sample. The simulations clearly showed
that this is the case for gap distances between 50 and
100 um, which is the range used in this work.

Implementing sequential chemistry using the MFP

We propose and implement two approaches to
sequentially expose a surface to different reagents in order
to implement a complete biochemical assay. One approach
is to sequentially deliver liquids with the MFP positioned
in a specific location over the surface. The second is to
perform the sequential reagent exposure of the liquids to
the surface by leveraging the scanning ability of the MFP
in combination with several neighboring HFCs.

In the liquid switching sequential chemistry approach,
the MFP head comprises three connectors to different
liquids that merge into one injection aperture that opens
into the center of the MFP head. By splitting the aspira-
tion into four L-shaped structures, as seen on the bottom
face of the head (see Fig. 3a), a square-shaped flow con-
finement is achieved. Here, we demonstrate sequential
chemistry in a defined region by switching the flow of
reagents externally. For this purpose, we control the flow
of each individual injection channel. Since the merging of
the three channels is close to the injection aperture, the
dead volumes are extremely small (<1 uL); therefore, the
switching times for typical injection flow rates (~6 uL/
min) are just a few seconds. This number takes into
account the exchange of the total liquid volume within the
flow confinement (0.02 uL). As the subsequent reagent
completely displaces the previous liquid, intermediate
washing steps, as applied in conventional protocols, are
eliminated. This adds to the time advantage of this
implementation. Using the approach of exchanging the
liquids in the HFC, we performed anti-P53 staining on a
4mm diameter cell block section (MDAMB468). We
implemented three steps of the IHC protocol, wherein
primary antibodies, secondary antibodies and streptavidin
peroxidase are displayed to the cell block section
sequentially. As seen in Fig. 3b, we stained footprints of
~500 x 500 um”, and in each of these footprints, we varied
the incubation times of the three steps (incubation times
provided in Fig. SI.5). As expected, the signal intensities
differed depending on the incubation strategies, and good
contrast and uniformity were obtained even with incu-
bation times as low as 30s for the primary antibody.

Another approach to the rapid sequential exposure of
multiple liquids on a surface is to scan with an MFP
multiple HFCs along one axis over the surface. We
designed a specific MFP head, where five HFCs can be run
simultaneously in a linear arrangement, each confining a
different liquid. Figure 3c, d show the experimental per-
formance using four different chemicals, with the fifth

Page 7 of 10

port left unused. The size of the HFCs and the scanning
velocity define the incubation times for the reagents on
the surface of the sample. Note that the incubation time of
an individual reagent could also be adapted through the
chip design or by confining the same reagent in multiple
neighboring HFCs. The injection channels in this con-
figuration do not merge in a single injection aperture as in
the other chip design. This is an advantage because two
sequential reagents could potentially react and clog the
channel. As each flow confinement is 500 um wide, and
these confinements are linearly arranged during scanning,
the resulting stained tissue section appears as a line along
the y-axis, Fig. 3d. In addition, the separation of the HFCs
prevents cross-contamination of reagents because there is
a small amount of immersion liquid between all HFCs, as
illustrated in the bottom of Fig. 2c. The scanning
approach also led to good staining results with an incu-
bation time of 30 s for each of the four implemented steps.

Towards optimizing processing parameters for
establishing rapid and efficient IHC

In conventional IHC, the practice is to make use of
protocols that previously provided good results for a given
type of tissue, antigen of interest and primary antibody.
Predefined protocols, however, do not take into account
the expression level of the antigens in a specific sample or
batch-to-batch variations in the performance of the
applied antibodies. A simple and rapid way to first test the
IHC parameters for a given sample would, therefore, allow
optimization of the quantity and the quality of the
information that can be retrieved from an IHC analysis. It
is possible to perform such optimization using entire
tissue sections. However, to traverse a reasonable number
of process parameters, the amount of tissue required to
determine an ideal set of processing parameters will be
rather large. As the MFP allows IHC to be performed at
the micrometer length scale, a fraction of the section can
be dedicated to such optimization purposes. Alternatively,
instead of using fractions of several sections, a single
section can be dedicated to establishing suitable IHC
process parameters. While this idea is well suited for
diagnostics, it is even more suitable for optimizing con-
ditions for screening-like applications, such as those
performed with tissue microarrays.

To demonstrate this concept of process parameter
optimization, we made use of another cell block section to
demonstrate sequential IHC. To determine the ideal

implemented negative controls without primary or sec-
ondary antibodies on two additional spots (bottom left
and right spot in Fig. 4a). A selection of higher-resolution
images can be found in the SI, Fig. SI.7.

After spotwise sequential incubation, streptavidin per-
oxidase and DAB chromogen were applied over the entire
section. Even with highly variable incubation times,
stained areas may appear very similar at first glance.
However, it is essential to determine the difference in
staining intensities between the nuclei and the cytoplasm
to extract meaningful quantitative data. An analysis of the
results revealed significant first- and second-order effects
of the incubation time with primary and secondary anti-
bodies (Fig. 4b). While increasing either of the two
incubation times had a positive effect on the signal level,
the signal contrast deteriorated for longer incubation with
primary antibodies. Our results, therefore, suggest that for
the current set of antibodies/antigens, an optimized
workflow should have a short incubation time for the

 

primary antibody and an incubation time approximately
five times longer for the secondary antibody. While the
general idea of having minimal incorrect binding in the
first step (primary antibody) and high amplification in the
second step holds, the exact ratio of incubation times
during each step might vary and would need to be
established on a case-by-case basis.

Summary and concluding remarks

The presented strategy for rapid IHC analysis is con-
servative in the consumption of a tissue section, benefits
from reduced amounts of reagents and is able to screen the
process parameters of the IHC protocol for good quality
stains. This approach complements our previous work on
computational heuristics to establish process parameters for
high-quality staining’*'’. The core of performing such
microscale IHC reactions on a tissue section is the hydro-
dynamic confinement of liquids using the microfluidic
probe. Here, we specifically propose two designs of MFP

Fig. 4 Exploring suitable staining conditions using process parameter optimization. a Experimental result of a two-factor central composite
design with two negative controls on a single cell block section (incubation times shown in seconds). Streptavidin peroxidase and DAB chromogen
were applied globally. b Analysis reveals statistically relevant first- and second-order effects for both factors. The figure displays the response surfaces
for the signal intensity (red-white-blue) and for the signal contrast (red-yellow-blue). The negative curvature of the intensity response surface for long
incubation times with primary antibodies does not make sense physically and is considered an artifact, which could be removed by increasing the
number of datapoints. The signal contrast deteriorates for long incubation with the primary antibody. Therefore, relatively short incubation with
primary antibodies and relatively long incubation with secondary antibodies results in the highest signal at the best contrast

heads to implement a complete IHC protocol. The imple-
mentation of the uIHC protocol is rapid in the first case
through the continuous replenishment of the reagents on
the tissue surfaces due to the flows inherent to the MFP”°
and in the second case due to the sequential presentation of
reagents, which also simultaneously rinse out the previous
liquid. From a technical perspective, this new class of MFP
heads provides new opportunities for how liquids can be
presented to the surface and how explicit shapes of the
confined liquid can be formed.

Owing to the above attributes, we think this may be the
genesis of real-time processing of tissue sections with an
immediate readout using nonfluorescent labels, resulting in
compatibility with existing pathology workflows. The devi-
ces and methods presented build on established and robust
workflows while significantly enhancing their dynamics and
versatility. Additionally, real-time IHC staining can be
readily applied to create gradients of the primary antibody,
thus enabling quantitative IHC*'. The strategies presented
here can be used for whole tissue processing. Furthermore,
to capture the variations in the tissue and support statistics-
guided decision-making, we think image processing soft-
ware would facilitate the implementation of MFP-based
IHC in fast and automated analysis routines. The presented

 

 

methods may also be extended to include preanalytical
steps required prior to staining (such as dewaxing and
antigen retrieval treatments).

Another interesting direction of this approach is to
study the kinetics of an antibody—antigen reaction. It is
well known that applying mathematical models does not
allow accurate establishment of the association constants
of the applied antibodies. Nonetheless, our method for the
local implementation of a specific combination of staining
conditions reveals the impact of varying kj, and compares
the performance of different batches to optimize proto-
cols in a targeted manner. The incubation times of pri-
mary and _ secondary antibodies can be varied
systematically following a design of experiments and
creating arrays of stains representing different incubation
conditions. In this work, we implemented a full factorial
design to assess the effects of the incubation times with
the primary antibody and the secondary antibody. An
array of stains featuring permutations of different incu-
bation times with the primary and secondary antibody
solutions would allow us to compare antibodies from
different batches or vendors and to optimize incubation
times in staining protocols in a targeted manner. In
summary, our technology can be used for quality checks

and screening, and we think that it has the potential to
deepen insights into valuable tissues and increase the
information obtained in scientific studies. Moreover, we
see great potential in implementing rapid IHC in sce-
narios where time to result is highly critical.

The current development stage of the MFP heads and
the experimental platform still has some limitations. The
stability of the liquid flow and switching between liquids
are sensitive to air bubbles forming in the tubing or
channels. Although degassing of liquids and good practice
in setting up the experiments minimizes the occurrence of
bubbles and consequent failure of the experiment, there is
still a need for further engineering of the system. There
are several strategies in microfluidics to avoid or cope
with bubble formation®”. We are also aware that the
current design is complex for fabrication, especially the
Si/glass hybrid heads, which require microfabrication in a
clean room. We are currently translating several of the
MEP head designs to work in plastics and become suitable
for injection molding.

In summary, we think that there is a need for strategies
in pathology to enable preoperative molecular screening
of tissues while using as much of the current workflows as
possible. IHC, due to its complex multistep and some-
times even multiday protocols, is confined to central
laboratories. Increasing its rapidity and automation could
enable the use of this method for diagnostics on fresh
tissue in combination with surgery. We believe that,
although still rudimentary, the methodology presented
here provides a starting point towards closing that gap
while enabling high-quality quantitative IHC to reduce
errors in diagnostics. To optimize our method for use in a
clinical setting, further validation by pathologists is
required. Such input would help to determine, for
example, the value of the time advantage for multiplexed
tissue analyses and whether the size of the stained regions
is sufficient for diagnostic interpretation. Overall, the
attributes of the methodology could also help significantly
in addressing open research questions, such as probing
tumor heterogeneity.
