Abstract

Who is a gamer? What kind of people are perceived to be gamers? And finally —
who perceives themselves as a gamer? In this article the authors attempt to
answer these three questions from a multinational perspective.

Background. Games are nowadays one of the most frequently encountered forms
of entertainment and constitute an ever-increasing part of many people’s day-
to-day lives. With the rising popularity of video games, there is a need to
conduct a research concerning gamer identity and to find out who perceives
themselves as a gamer. The aim of this study is to compare the results of
the survey conducted in two different countries to better understand the
characteristics of players that self-identified as gamers.

Methods. The quantitative study was conducted in two countries — Poland and
the United States — in order to research gamer identity. The questionnaire
consisted of questions about the self-identification as a gamer, time spent
playing video games, types of games played, and the platforms used. It was
conducted among 223 students who play video games.

Results. The results show that there are both similarities and differences in the
meaning of gamer identity between Poland and the United States. People who
consider themselves gamers generally spend more time playing games than non-
gamers regardless of the country. However, some differences can be spotted
between Poland and the U.S. concerning among others types of games played,
used platforms or different styles of playing video games.

Limitations and further research. The main problem in the study was the limited
age range in the sample. In the future it seems valuable to include people of
different age groups to broaden the study of self-identified gamer identity.

Video games have become one of the most common ways to spend free time and con-
stitute an ever-increasing part of many people’s day-to-day lives, regardless of age.
Games are one of the most frequently encountered forms of entertainment in modern
society. Adults today spend more time playing video games than previous generations
have (Williams et al., 2008), and this is likely due to the fact that most adults grew up
playing video games (Wulf et al., 2018).

According to the Entertainment Software Association (2019), in the year 2018 the
total video game sales almost reached $45 billion worldwide. It is estimated that over
65% of adult Americans play video games on average approximately 5 hours a week.
Male players constitute a little bit more than a half of all the people regularly playing
video games . Some differences can be observed between different groups of players —
males and females, younger and older players etc. For example, in the United States of
America, men tend to use consoles typically whereas women play mainly on mobile
phones (Entertainment Software Association, 2019). In other countries, for example in
Poland the statistics are quite similar. According to the research conducted by Forbes,
around 50% of adult Poles play video games and the most common device for these
players is the mobile phone (Kowalik & Kanraszewski, 2018). However, according to
the report State of the Polish Video Game Industry more gamers in Poland use their
personal computers to play games than in other countries (Bobrowski et al., 2017).

Understanding the Term “‘Gamer’”’

When many people think of a gamer they picture a young white man (Dill & Thill,
2007) and research has shown that, historically, gamers have fit this description
(McClure & Mears, 1984). According to Williams (2005), a gamer is thought to be an
“isolated, pale-skinned teenage boys (sitting) hunched forward on a sofa in some dark
basement space, obsessively mashing buttons” (p. 5). People often consider gamers
as nerds, being overly intellectual, obsessive, spending too much time indoors, and
socially awkward, although these associations occur more frequently for men than
women (Storla, 2011; Taylor, 2012). Although, this stereotypical image of a person
spending a lot of time playing games seems to be changing in recent years (Paaien
et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2008), a recent study (Amby et al., 2020) found that
individuals who were not gamers stereotyped gamers as lazy, violent, introverts, irre-
sponsible, but smart. The gamer image seems to remain strongly associated with
Cwil and Howe 787

 

being male (Shaw, 2010), although recent research indicates that most people do not
believe in the teenage isolated and pale-skinned image anymore (Kowert et al., 2014).
However, surveys of MMO players (Griffiths et al., 2004; Yee, 2006) found evidence
that the players are older and more social than the stereotypes suggest.

Claims about the sex of a gamer are also contradictory to the results of large-scale
polls which indicate that around half of the players in different countries are women
(Entertainment Software Association, 2019; Kowalik & Kanraszewski, 2018). But
sometimes gamers who know that women play games, do not consider them as true
gamers because of the genres and platforms that they prefer (Juul, 2009; Paawen et al.,
2017; Shaw & Chess, 2016; Vanderhoef, 2013). Women more often play so called
casual games (e.g., Candy Crush Saga or Farmville) on casual platforms such as
smartphones (Kuittinen et al., 2007). Women also report that they spend less time
playing games (Hartmann & Klimmt, 2006; Poels et al., 2012; Terlecki et al., 2011).
An important consideration of both the rise of casual games and the fewer hours played
on such games is how that affects the profitability of games (Consalvo & Paul, 2019)
and shifts them from “premium” to “freemium” (Shaw & Chess, 2016). Furthermore,
women have been visually present in the growing eSport and mobile gaming commu-
nity (Cwil et al., 2019). What is interesting is the fact that the majority of avatars in the
games are aggressive men, whereas female characters are hyper-sexualized in many
games (Dill & Thill, 2007). This differential socialization impacts the way people
(especially women) identify themselves with those avatars (Behm-Morawitz &
Mastro, 2009; Downs & Smith, 2010; Williams et al., 2009). As a result women often
have a lesser connection with the character that represents them in the video game.

There is no singular definition of a gamer. In some studies, the factor that is the
most important when considering somebody as a gamer is the average time that the
person spends playing games (Hartmann & Klimmt, 2006; Paawen et al., 2017; Poels
et al., 2012; Terlecki et al., 2011; Vermeulen et al., 2011). However, there is as least
one serious drawback to this solution — the findings are most often based on self-
reported game time, which is subject to the under-reporting effects especially for
women (Kahn et al., 2014; Paafen et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2009). For example, in
the research conducted by Williams et al. (2009) it was found that women underesti-
mated their weekly play time by more than 3 hours while men underestimated their
weekly play time by about | hour.

Women’s gender identity often conflicts with gamer identity (Storla, 2011; Taylor,
2012). For example, Kowert et al. (2012) found that among self-identified gamers
studied only 14.4% were female and according to Burch and Wiseman (2015) only
35% of female adolescents identified themselves as gamers, whereas almost 70% of
young men did so. Notably, Gamergate began in 2014, (Snyder, 2019) in between
these two studies, and the number of women that identified as gamers more than dou-
bled from 14.4% in Kowert et al. (2012) to 35% in Burch and Wiseman (2015).
Perhaps the spotlight shone on women game developers allowed more female adoles-
cents to feel at ease identifying with the term gamer. However, most of the research on
gamers has been conducted in the United States, and it is therefore both essential and
interesting to compare these findings to other countries. Some researchers use the
788 Simulation & Gaming 5 | (6)

 

genre of preference to determine gamers and non-gamers. Gamers and non-gamers
often differ on the game genres that they both prefer and play (Vanderhoef, 2013;
Vermeulen et al., 2011). Individuals playing first-person-shooters, massive-multiplayer-
online, and strategy games are more often considered gamers (Paafen et al., 2017) than
those that play social or casual games (Bosser & Nakatsu, 2006; Consalvo, 2011).

Another way to distinguish gamers and non-gamers while conducting a research is
to ask participants to self-identify (Kowert et al., 2012). According to some research-
ers the subjective identification with a group can be a better predictor of this person
behavior and the group attitudes than more objective measures like time spent playing
video games (Jetten et al., 2001; Turner, 1984). The self-identification is based on
one’s sense of belonging to a certain group and therefore reflects people feelings
regarding their self-awareness and belonging. Grooten and Kowert (2015) note that a
choice to self-identify oneself as a gamer is a different process of gamer categorization
than an assignment from an outside source, such as a researcher assigning gamer status
based on hours played. Research has shown that women consider themselves as gam-
ers less often than men (Howe et al., 2019), but this is due to a variety of factors
including avatar depiction (Dill & Thill, 2007), social issues like Gamergate (Shaw &
Chess, 2016), as well as the stereotypical depiction of men as gamers (McClure &
Mears, 1984; Williams, 2005). We conclude that, although there are multiple
approaches to determine who is and who is not a gamer, the best way to determine if a
participant identifies as a gamer or not is to ask the participant.

Theoretical Framework

In this study the authors used a social identity approach to understand why individuals
identify, or not, as a gamer. Social identity approach refers to two intertwined but dis-
tinct psychological theories — self-categorization theory and social identity theory
(Postmes & Branscombe, 2010; Tajfel et al., 1979; Turner, 1999). The social identity
theory approach tries to mitigate against the tendency to distinguish and conflate the
two theories (Brown, 2000; Haslam et al., 2010). Social identity is the state of people
thinking about themselves inside of social groups and social surrounding. Self-
categorization means that people think in the categories of groups and give a meaning
to the distinguished categories in order to understand the task of the group in the spe-
cific situation. Social identification is the process by which people match themselves
to one or a few of those categories on the basis of their gender, age, religion, hobbies,
education and other factors. Social identity is derived primarily from group member-
ships and interaction with other members of a group (Brown, 2000). People belonging
to one group share some characteristics and begin thinking about themselves in the
context of the group, assigning group characteristics to themselves. The closer per-
sonal characteristics of a person are to other members of a group, the more a person
feels that they belong to that community and behave more similar to other members
(Postmes & Branscombe, 2010).

Not everyone who plays video games considers themselves a gamer (Howe et al.,
2019; Shaw, 2010). Similarly, not everyone who plays sports identifies as an athlete or
Cwil and Howe 789

 

everyone who sings as a musical artist. Factors such as time (Paaken et al., 2017),
financial incentives (Alexander, 2014; Shaw & Chess, 2016), socialization (Dill &
Thill, 2007), demographics (McClure & Mears, 1984), and more combine to form
individual motivations that may or may not lead to a player identifying as a gamer.
Additionally, in the case of gamers, not only can we describe their social identity but
also consumer identity. Gamers purchase games and in-game content to fulfil their
needs. Understanding people self-identification with the group of gamers can be ben-
eficial not only to understand people belonging to a certain social group but also to
recognize their buying patterns and behaviors.

As not all of the people who play video games identify themselves as belonging to
the social group of gamers, the following seem to be interesting questions to answer —
who matches themselves to a group of gamers? Who perceives themselves as a gamer
and think in the categories of belonging to this social group? It would be enlightening
to study the differences between people who identify as a gamer, or not, as well as
contrast these findings between people from different countries, as what may drive
Americans to identify as a gamer may not be what drives individuals from other coun-
tries to identify as a gamer.

Proposal of Research Questions and Hypotheses

On the basis of literature review the research questions and hypothesis were proposed.
The authors aimed to study and compare the gamer identity in Poland and the United
States during this research. The factors that were included in the analysis were the fol-
lowing: games genres, time of play, technology used and biological sex of the player.
Four research questions were outlined:

RQ1: Who identifies themselves as a gamer in Poland and the United States? Are
there any differences in matching yourself to the group of gamers between those
two countries?

RQ2: How, if at all, do video game players in Poland and the United States differ
on the games they prefer?

RQ3: How, if at all, do video game players in Poland and the United States differ
on the amount and types of hours they play?

RQ4: How, if at all, do video game players in Poland and the United States differ
on the technology they use to play video games?

In order to answer the mentioned research questions in more detail, specific hypoth-
eses were proposed, concerning characteristics such as biological sex, time spent play-
ing video games, types of games played, and technological devices used. Previous
literature has overwhelming found that men identify as gamers more often than women
and we therefore proposed that:

H1: Men in both a) Poland and b) the United States identify themselves as gamers
more often than women.
790 Simulation & Gaming 5 | (6)

 

Hours of gameplay has been linked to gamer identification in previous literature
and we therefore propose:

H2: Gamers in both a) Poland and b) the United States play more hours of video
games than non-gamers.

Gaming genre has been conceptually associated with gamer identity, although not
always supported by empirical data, yet we still offer the following hypothesis:

H3: Gamers in both a) Poland and b) the United States prefer first-person shooters
(FPS), massively multiplayer online games (MMO), sports and role-playing games
(RPG) more often than non-gamers.

It would be also interesting to find out if those who play the genres listed above
consider themselves as gamers more often in comparison to people playing other
games, for example social ones.

H4: Non-Gamers in both a) Poland and b) the United States prefer social, strategy,
simulation and retro games more often than non-gamers.

Research on gamer identity, to date, would lead us to believe that gamers prefer to
play on consoles and it is therefore proposed that:

H5: Gamers in both a) Poland and b) the United States prefer to play on consoles
more than any other device.

These hypotheses were taken into consideration while preparing a questionnaire for
further quantitative analysis.

Method

In order to research gamer identity a questionnaire was designed, specially for the
purpose of this study. The same set of questions was used in both countries — Poland
and the United States, however two language versions were used — Polish and English
one. The questionnaire consisted of questions concerning self-identification as a
gamer, time spent playing video games, types of games played and platforms used.
There was also one open-ended question in the survey about the main motivation for
playing games.

Participants

A total number of 223 participants took part in the research, around half of them being
from Poland, half of them from the United States of America. The researchers used
Cwil and Howe 79|

 

purposive sampling for the need of this research. The precondition to take part in the
designed research was that each of the participants needs to play any kind of video
games. People who do not play video games were not included in the further analysis.
The main reason to make the exclusion was the fact that the researchers wanted to
conduct a deeper analysis of the types of games, platforms or ways of playing and to
do so only people playing games have knowledge of the type of games they prefer and
how they play these games. Furthermore, individuals that do not play video games
have been found to hold negative attitudes and beliefs about games (Amby et al., 2020;
Kort-Butler, 2020) that could alter the results based on stigma and not gamer identity.
The results were collected between March and June 2019.

A total number of 104 participants from a large Polish university completed the
online survey. The research was approved by our institution’s Institutional Review
Board. The age of the participants in this sample ranged from 18 to 45 (M = 24.91, SD
= 4.63). In the Polish sample the majority of the sample consisted of men, only 35%
of respondents identified as women. Almost 50% of participants identified themselves
as gamers (48 out of 96 people who answered this question). Most participants reported
being from Poland (71) and other countries represented were: Ukraine (14), France
(7), China (3), Belarus (1), India (1), Malaysia (1), and Serbia (1); 5 participants did
not provide their country of origin. Regarding race, 97 participants identified as white
and 6 identified as Asian. Most participants had finished at least two years of college
(70.4%).

The United States sample was collected from a large public mid-south-western
university undergraduate communication pool, in the US, after IRB approval.
Participants received research credit for their participation to use in communication
courses. A total of 119 participants from the United States completed this survey. The
age of participants ranged from 18 to 27 (M = 19.98, SD = 1.47). In the United States
sample only around 33% of the respondents identified as women, with 80 out of 119
participants of the research being male. Among the American sample 40% of the
respondents identified as gamers (48 out of 119). Regarding race or ethnicity, partici-
pants identified as white (96), black or African-American (11), American Indian or
Alaskan Native (3), Asian (12), Latinx (5), and Middle Eastern (1). Participants were
allowed to select more than one race/ethnicity with which they identified. Most par-
ticipants had finished at least two years of college (73.1%).

The demographic makeup of the samples from two different countries were similar
in age, gender and education, although there were expected differences in race, ethnic-
ity and nationality.

Data Collection

After participants agreed to be part of the study and provided informed consent, they
completed an online questionnaire that included questions about demographic infor-
mation, gamer identity, hours of gameplay, technology of gameplay, genre of game-
play, and motivations for gameplay.

Gamer Identity

As previously mentioned, gamer identity may best be assessed by asking participants
if they identify as a gamer or not (Kowert et al., 2012). The term gamer may have both
stigma and pride attached to it and therefore the authors conclude that a willingness of
a participant to accept the label of gamer and self-identify as a gamer may be a better
representation of who is and who is not a gamer than other novel practices.

Hours of Gameplay

Participants were asked how many hours a week they played alone, co-present, and
online. These hours were then summated to create an overall hours played variable as
well as retaining unique measures for hours played alone, co-present, and online.

Technology of Gameplay

Participants were first asked to specify all the technologies and consoles they use to
play video games, and then to identify which one they use most often. The respondents
could choose from the following options: XBOX, PlayStation, Nintendo, Personal
Computer and Cell Phone.

Genre of Gameplay

Eight genres of video games were then presented to participants and included: first-
person shooter (FPS), massive multiplayer online (MMO), role-playing game (RPG),
strategy, social, sports, retro, and simulation. In the questionnaire for each of the genres
a few examples of games were presented to make it easier for participants to assign
their favourite games to one of the given genres. Participants were asked to order these
genres from their most favorite to their least favorite genre. Although it is acknowl-
edged that some games such as Battlefield 4 could fit in multiple genres because users
play the same game in differential ways (Howe & Lee, 2018). However, the way the
player enjoys the game the most is likely indicative, or at least highly correlated, with
their most preferred genre. For further analysis a variable of genre preference was cre-
ated with the genre that the participant preferred the most as a nominal variable.

Data Cleaning

All data was analyzed using SPSS v. 25. The data was first examined to see if data was
systematically missing. According to Little’s MCAR test data was not systematically
missing but was missing completely at random (y? = 43.50, 53, p > .05). Data were
also examined for skewness and kurtosis and no issues were noted.

Results

To test H1, that men in both a) Poland and b) the United States identify themselves as
gamers more often than women, a chi-square analysis was conducted with results split

in the United States (vy? = 21.81, 1, p < .001) identified as gamers more often than
women. It is worth noting that only 4 of the 39 female US participants identified as a
gamer whereas 10 of the 35 female Polish participants identified as a gamer. The
strength of association is higher in case of the American sample (Cramers’ V = 0.428)
than Polish sample (Cramers’ V = 0.290). Please see Table | for full statistics.

To test H2, that people who consider themselves gamers in both a) Poland and b)
the United States play more hours of video games than non-gamers, a test of bivariate
correlations was conducted to further examine these relationships. In Poland indi-
viduals that identified as a gamer played more hours alone (7 = .215, p < .05), more
hours online (7 = .484, p < .001), and more hours overall (7 = .496, p <.001) than
those that did not identify as a gamer. However no significant difference was found
regarding hours of games played in a co-present manner. At the same time, playing
games with other people co-present is the least popular manner of playing video
games in Poland — for both self-identified gamers and non-gamers.

The United States sample had similar, but stronger, results. Individuals that iden-
tified as a gamer played more hours alone (7 = .242, p < .01), co-present (r = .300,
p < .001), online (r = .519, p < .001), and overall (r = .499, p <.001) than those
that did not identify as a gamer. Importantly playing with others was significantly
associated with identifying as a gamer in the United States sample, but not in the
Polish sample.

A MANOVA was then conducted to see if there were any significant differences
between how many hours individuals in Poland and the United States played. Results
revealed that there were significant differences between gameplay of Poles and
Americans (F(3, 214) = 4.60, p < .001, 7? = .061). Of the four types of hours played
only playing co-present was significantly different in that Americans played more
hours co-present (F(1, 216) = 7.34, p < .01, 7? = .033). This MANOVA also tested
differences between hours of gameplay between men and women. Significant differ-
ences were found (F(3, 214) = 6.14, p < .001, 7? = .079). Further analysis revealed
that men played significantly more hours co-present (F(1, 216) = 5.48, p < .05, 77 =
.025), online (F(1, 216) = 16.50, p < .001, 4? = .071), and in total (F(1, 216) = 16.57,
p< .001, 7? = .071), than women did. No significant interaction between country and
biological sex were found. Please see Table 2 for full statistics.

In order to properly assess, H3: gamers in both a) Poland and b) the United States
prefer first-person shooters (FPS), massively multiplayer online games (MMO), sports

and role-playing games (RPG) more often than non-gamers and H4: Non-Gamers in
both a) Poland and b) the United States prefer social, strategy, simulation and retro
games more often than non-gamers, participants identification of their preferred genre
was dummy-coded in a dichotomous manner so that 0 equaled any response other than
“most preferred” and 1 equaled “most preferred”. The data was then analyzed using a
chi-square analysis of gamer and most preferred genre. Results revealed that in the
U.S. sample there were statistically significant differences between gamers and non-
gamers regarding genre preferred (vy? = 25.54, 7, N = 119, p < .001). Gamers rated
the genres of FPS, MMO, and RPG games as most preferred more often than non-
gamers. At the same time, non-identified gamers rated all other genres as most pre-
ferred more often in comparison to self-identified gamers. The biggest differences can
be seen taking into consideration social, sports and simulation games. Results of the
Polish sample indicated no significant relationship between genre preferred and self-
identifying as a gamer (y* = 6.20, 7, N = 99, p > .05). The similar number of people
in both groups — gamers and non-gamers — chose each of the genres as their favourite
genre. In total, among both Polish and American respondents the most popular genre
was First-Person Shooter. Please see Table 3 for full statistics.

An additional chi-square analysis was run to examine H5, gamers in both a) Poland
and b) the United States prefer to play on consoles more than any other device. Results

001), but they preferred different technology than Polish gamers as well. In Poland
gamers tend to prefer playing games using their personal computer, while non-gamers
use most often cell phones. Results from the US sample indicate that in this country
non-gamers also prefer cell phones, but gamers play mostly using consoles - XBOX
and PlayStation. What can be concluded from this analysis is the fact that the most popu-
lar platform in Poland is undoubtedly PlayStation (among gamers and non-gamers),
while in the United States the highest number of people choose XBOX. The full statistics
are presented in the Table 4.

Discussion

The results of the conducted research show that there are both similarities and differ-
ences among gamers and in the meaning of gamer identity between Poland and the
United States. In both countries among people who play video games men identify
themselves as gamers more often than women, whereas this difference is more promi-
nent in case of the US. In this country only around 10% of women who took part in the
research identified themselves as gamers, while almost 60% of men did so. These
results are in accordance with Entertainment Software Association research (2019).

People who consider themselves gamers generally spend more time playing
games than non-gamers, which is not surprising. However, in Poland no statistically
significant difference was found between time spent playing games by gamers and
non-gamers who do it co-present. In both countries the biggest difference between
gamers and non-gamers can be observed in the case of online gaming. People who
perceive themselves gamers spend much more time playing games online than peo-
ple who doo not identify themselves as gamers. It can be concluded that spending a
lot of time playing games online is one of the characteristics that distinguish gamers
from non-gamers.

Gamers in the United States were found to play significantly more hours of co-
present games. There can be various explanations of this phenomenon. Firstly, the rise
of sporting games (e.g. Madden, FIFA, PGA Tour) (Sicart, 2013) in the United States
and the number of women playing such sports games (Consalvo, 2013) likely has
contributed to more co-present gaming. Secondly, the rise of eSports as games could
facilitate more local play on mobile games as well as on console games (Wardaszko
et al., 2019). Finally, in Eastern European countries video game consoles became pop-
ular much later than in the US. First consoles were introduced on the American market
in the early 1970s and with time became more and more popular whereas in Poland
this technology gained popularity and got affordable only at the turn of the century
(Kluska, 2008). At this time computers were already commonly used by people play-
ing video games and made it possible to play online with other players instead of play-
ing co-present.

During the research the authors also found that although men and women did not
differ on how many hours they played alone, they did differ in the number of hours
played co-present, online, and in aggregate. These trends are in line with previous
research, however, in this study we were able to tease out the specific ways that men
play more hours than women. Future studies should examine any differences between
the genre choices of men and women as well as technology preferred.

As far as game genres are concerned, in Poland it seems that self-identified gamers
and non-gamers play the same types of games, while in the US statistically significant
differences can be spotted. There, gamers choose to play role-playing games much
more often than non-gamers, while non-gamers prefer playing social or sports games.
It is interesting to note that this kind of distinction cannot be seen in the case of Polish
gamers. There is a slight difference in FPS and MMO preferences in favour of gamers
Cwil and Howe 797

 

and in strategy games in favour of non-gamers. This result is contridactory to what was
expected after the literature review (Vanderhoef, 2013; Vermeulen et al., 2011).

In both of the researched countries, there is a relation between identifying yourself
with the label gamer and platform preference. In Poland and the US non-gamers much
more often use cell phones for the purpose of playing games than people who perceive
themselves as gamers. In both countries gamers in comparison to non-gamers prefer
playing using their personal computers, however this difference is more vivid in
Poland than in the United States which is consistent with the report State of the Polish
Video Game Industry (Bobrowski et al., 2017). What is interesting, the use of consoles
(XBOX, PlayStation, Nintendo) for playing games in Poland is similar between gam-
ers and non-gamers whereas in the US these platforms are more often used by self-
identified gamers. Moreover, the most popular console in Poland is PlayStation,
whereas in the US it is XBOX, among both gamers and non-gamers.

The results of the conducted research show that there are cross-cultural differences
between the US and Poland with regard to gamer identity, platforms used, types of
games preferred and styles of playing games (online, co-present, alone). It is important
and interesting as a large part of the research concerning games and gamers is con-
ducted in the US and as the results of the study show — when describing gamer culture
the differences between countries and cultures should not be ignored. Therefore, it is
justified to broaden the research on gamer identity to other countries and cultures.

The conducted study is not without limitations. One of the main drawbacks relates
to the nature of the sample which consisted of college students and is not representa-
tive for the whole society. The result was that most of the participants were in their
early twenties which made it impossible for researchers to compare people belonging
to different age cohorts. In the future study it seems to be valuable to include people of
different age groups to verify the hypothesis concerning the age of gamers and non-
gamers. Given that many adults have grown up playing video games, it may be fruitful
to examine the demographic, genre preferences, and technology use of older adults to
more fully understand who identifies as a gamer. It would also be of interest how indi-
viduals from the global south identify with the label of gamer.
