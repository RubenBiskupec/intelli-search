Introduction

Denial of service (DoS) attack [1, 2] is a common attack vector, which generally seeks
to exhaust the limited network resources, resulting in the legitimate users’ requests not
being processed. DoS attacks are becoming more widespread, targeting IoT networks [3,
4], SDN networks [5, 6], cloud computing environments [7, 8] and cyber-physical sys-
tems [9]. Aiming to combat DoS attacks, many methods have been proposed, in which a
common detection method is based on abnormal statistical characteristics.

Another type of DoS attack is the low-rate denial of service (LDoS) attack [10-12]
that is hard to be accurately detected due to its low-rate nature. Many LDoS attacks
have emerged, such as Shrew attacks [13], LoRDAS attacks [14], slow DoS attacks(e.g.
Slow Next, SlowComm) [15, 16], etc. These attacks have the same characteristics, that
is, they do not need to maintain sustained high-speed attack traffic to cause dam-
age. Among all these attacks, TCP-targeted LDoS attacks are one of the most com-

mon LDoS attacks. To reduce the TCP’s throughput, the attacker sends packet bursts

at intervals, causing the response and adjustment of the congestion control mecha-
nism. Because the adaptive response and adjustment caused by the attack are legal, it
increases the difficulty of attack detection. When the network is congested, the data
packet will be lost which will cause the network traffic to compete for the limited
network resources [17]. Since UDP traffic is not impacted by the congestion con-
trol mechanism, it can compete for more network resources than TCP traffic when
congestion occurs. Therefore, LDoS attacker typically uses UDP traffic as an attack-
ing burst [18, 19]. Figure 1 shows the model of TCP-targeted LDoS attacks [20],
three parameters (T, L, R) are used to describe the attack model where T denotes
the period, L represents the burst length, and R is the burst rate. To maximize the
attack outcome, the attacker sets the value of T based on the retransmission timeout
(RTO). In each attack period T, the attack burst length L is much smaller than 7,
which means that the average attack rate (R x =) of LDoS attacks is relatively small.
Therefore, the method based on abnormal statistical characteristics cannot effectively
detect this attack.

To detect the TCP-targeted LDoS attack, a method using two-step cluster analy-
sis [21] and UTR analysis is proposed. The cluster analysis is used to divide the net-
work traffic with similar characteristics into the same cluster since the network traffic
subjected to LDoS attacks has similar characteristics. Then UTR analysis is used to
determine which clusters have suffered LDoS attacks. The major contributions are as

follows.

« Network traffic’s characteristics under LDoS attacks are analyzed using variance and
entropy.

« Network traffic with different characteristics is divided into different clusters through
cluster analysis and UTR analysis is then used to identify clusters containing LDoS
attacks.

« The detection method has been evaluated in NS2 simulation platform, test-bed net-
work environment and public dataset WIDE [22]. Experimental results prove that
the method has a good performance in detecting LDoS attacks.

The paper’s organization is as follows. Related researches on LDoS attack detection
are presented in "Related work" section. Network traffic’s characteristics are investi-
gated in "Analysis of network traffic characteristics" section. The detection approach

is described in "Proposed approach" section. The detection method is evaluated

via experiments in different platform and the experimental results are analyzed in
"Experiments and results analysis" section. The whole paper is summarized and the

future work is introduced in "Conclusion and future work" section.

Related work
To combat LDoS attacks, researchers have proposed many defense strategies [23-25]
including two categories. The first is a feature-based defense strategy, and the second is

an anomaly-based defense strategy.

The feature-based defense strategy

Although LDoS attacks have great concealment, their periodicity and impulsivity pro-
vide the basis for detection. The feature-based defense strategy implements detection by
analyzing the principles and features of LDoS attacks.

Wu et al. [26] proposed a method based on the sequence matching, which uses the
Smith—Waterman algorithm and double threshold rules to detect LDoS attacks. Yue
et al. [27] proposed a method to detect the LDoS attack traffic using the wavelet energy
spectrum and the combined neural network. Sun et al. [28] proposed the DIT W detec-
tion method using dynamic time-wrapping to perform feature matching on the sampled
network traffic, and the DRR algorithm is used to limit the attack flow on the router for
the bandwidth allocation and resource protection. For defending against LDoS attacks
in wireless sensor networks, Cao et al. [29] developed AccFlow, in which the flow’s pack-
ets with larger loss rate are more aggressively to be dropped by AccFlow since attacking

flows are featured with high loss rates.

The anomaly-based defense strategy

When LDoS attacks occur, the features of the network will be changed. The anomaly-
based defense strategy implements the LDoS attack detection according to the anomaly
of the network features.

Zhang et al. [30] proposed using wavelet multi-scale analysis and adaptive KPCA to
detect LDoS attacks, in which the KPCA method is used as an anomaly detection model.
Wu et al. [19] proposed a method to detect LDoS attack flows according to the network
multifractal, in which LDoS attacks are confirmed according to the D-value. The anom-
aly of network multifractal means the occurrence of LDoS attacks since the attack flow
will change this characteristic. Periodic LDoS attack flows and normal network flows
have different frequency domain features. Many detection methods based on frequency
domain feature anomalies have been proposed [31-33]. For example, Chen et al. [18]
proposed to combine power spectrum analysis and information entropy to detect and
mitigate LDoS attacks.

To accurately detect LDoS attacks, new countermeasures still need to be designed.
Machine learning is recently applied to LDoS attack detection [34—36]. This paper pro-
posed an LDoS detection method using machine learning, in which two-step cluster
analysis is used to evaluate TCP’s characteristics and TCP traffic with similar charac-
teristics is divided into the same cluster. Then clusters suffered LDoS attacks are deter-
mined through UTR analysis.

Analysis of network traffic characteristics

From the perspective of network architecture, network behavior can be researched
through network traffic, because network behavior can often be reflected in the charac-
teristics of the network traffic [37]. Network traffic can be defined as a stochastic process
{X(t),t = nAt,n € z*}, where At is the sampling time interval and X(é) represents the
number of data packets that reached the detection point in the period (¢ — At, t]. Define
the data packet sequence within a time length Timepy as the detection unit, that is, the
detection unit is {X(i+ 1),...,X(i+N)}, where N = firey The proposed detection
approach starts with the packet process of network traffic to realize the detection of
LDoS attacks.

LDoS attacks exploit the congestion control mechanism’s defects to limit TCP traffic
on the network. When the congestion control mechanism is triggered, the congestion
window will be reduced to one package and wait for an RTO time before attempting to
retransmit. If the attacker can acquire the exact value of RTO in each round, then (s)he
can send the attack packages to the victim system when TCP source-end retransmits
TCP packages. Consequently, this leads to failure for each retransmission and the capac-
ity of the congestion window will always be one and the throughput of TCP traffic will
be zero. However, the exact value of RTO in each round is hard to acquire. Generally,
an LDoS attack will repeatedly trigger the congestion control mechanism for achieving
the attack effect of reducing TCP throughput. Therefore, TCP traffic during the LDoS
attack will fall into a vicious cycle of drop-recovery-drop. Compared with TCP traffic in
normal network scenarios, TCP traffic in LDoS attack scenarios becomes more discrete
and unstable.

Variance is used to measure the TCP’s discrete characteristics. The formula of vari-
ance is Eq. 1, where m is the mean value of the number of data packets in a detec-
tion unit and WN is the length of the detection unit. Shannon entropy is used to
evaluate the TCP’s randomness and uncertainty. The formula of the Shannon
entropy is Eq. 2, where pj; is the probability of the value of the number of the data
packet in a detection unit and N is the length of the value sequence. If the detec-
tion unit DU = {15,10,12,15,12,15,11,10,12,12}, then the value sequence is
value = {15,10,12,11}, where 0.3 represents the probability of 15 appearing in the

detection unit, and other values are similar.

Figure 2 shows TCP traffic in different network scenarios, in which (a) is the scenario
that LDoS attacks occur and (b) is the scenario that no LDoS attacks occur. As shown
in the figure, TCP traffic’s characteristics in these two scenarios are different. TCP traf-
fic subjected to LDoS attacks is unstable and in a cycle of drop-recovery-drop because
of repeated triggers of the congestion control mechanism. TCP traffic without LDoS
attacks is stable and concentrates on a high level. Figure 3 shows variance and Shannon

TCP traffic and (b) shows the Shannon entropy of TCP traffic. Compared to TCP traffic
without LDoS attacks, variance and Shannon entropy of TCP traffic under LDoS attacks

are significantly larger.

Proposed approach

According to the analysis in the preceding section, the detection method using two-step
cluster analysis and UTR analysis is proposed. Figure 4 shows the detection process.
First, network traffic is collected for LDoS attack detection and the packet sequence is
divided into the detection units. Then variance and Shannon entropy of each detection
unit are calculated for evaluating the TCP’s characteristics. And two-step cluster anal-
ysis is used to divide detection units into multiple clusters. TCP traffic with the same
characteristics is gathered into the same cluster, that is, TCP traffic that may have suf-
fered LDoS attacks will be divided into the same cluster. Finally, UTR analysis is used to

determine which clusters have suffered an LDOS attack.

Two-step cluster analysis
Two-step cluster analysis [21] includes balanced iterative reducing and clustering using
hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm and agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. The

first step is to investigate the distance of all records to build a cluster feature (CF) tree and
records with high similarity will be divided into the same node. The second step is to fur-
ther merge the subclusters until the optimal number M of clusters using the agglomeration
hierarchical clustering algorithm, in which subclusters are obtained through CF tree’s leaf
nodes. In the proposed method, the optimal number M of clusters is determined based on

the within-group mean square error (WMSE).

BIRCH algorithm

BIRCH algorithm uses cluster features that can effectively compress the data size to
describe the information of each cluster. The CF of a cluster containing N D-dimensional
data points {x,,1 = 1,2,...,N}is a triple CF =< N, Ly Xs >, where WN is the number of
data points, =; = 5-1 &n is the linear sum of the data points, and ©; = ~~, X2 is the sum
of the square of each data point.

BIRCH algorithm builds a CF tree based on the distance of all records and records with
closer distance will be divided into the same node. The closer the records are, the higher
their similarity. The centroid of a cluster that contains N data points is Eq. 3. In this paper,
the proposed method uses centroid Euclidian distance to measure the distance between
clusters and the formula is Eq. 4. Algorithm 1 shows the BIRCH algorithm and CF tree
structural details can refer to [38]. The input of the algorithm is M 2-dimensional data
points which are the variance and Shannon entropy of detection units. The output of the
algorithm is N subclusters, which are obtained based on the leaf nodes of the CF tree.

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm

Subclusters obtained from the CF tree’s leaf nodes will be merged one by one through
the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm until the optimal number M of clus-
ters. WMSE is used to determine the value of M and the formula of WMSE is Eq. 5. As
the number of data points in the cluster decreases with the number of clusters increases,
the data points become more concentrated and the WMSE value also decreases. The
optimal number M is determined based on the "elbow” of WMSE’s change with the
number of clusters because when WMSE slowly decreases, further increasing the num-
ber of clusters cannot enhance the effect. Algorithm 2 shows the aggregation hierarchi-
cal clustering algorithm. Firstly the centroid of each subcluster and the proximity matrix
are calculated. When the two closest subclusters are merged, the centroid of the new
cluster and the proximity matrix are updated. Subclusters are merged until there are

only M clusters.

UTR analysis

UTR analysis is performed on the M clusters obtained from the two-step cluster analysis
to determine which clusters suffered LDoS attacks. UTRpz is the ratio of UDP traffic to
TCP traffic in a detection unit and the formula is Eq. 6, which is the number of all UDP
traffic packets divided by the number of all TCP traffic packets in the detection unit.
UDPpy is the number of UDP traffic packets and TCPpy is the number of TCP traffic
packets in the detection unit. UTR tse, is the ratio of UDP traffic to TCP traffic in a
cluster and the formula is Eq. 7, which is the UTRpy’s mean value in the cluster.

Since UDP traffic is not impacted by the congestion control mechanism, it can com-
pete for more network resources than TCP traffic when congestion occurs. Therefore,
an LDoS attacker typically uses UDP traffic as an attacking burst [18]. Figure 20 shows
the UTR frequency distribution in the WIDE dataset [22], in which no LDoS attacks
occur. In normal scenarios, UDP traffic and TCP traffic will remain at a roughly constant
ratio. When LDoS attacks occur, the throughput of TCP traffic will be severely reduced.
Although the average rate of LDoS attack flows will not change significantly, UTR will
change significantly. Algorithm 3 shows UTR analysis, where Q is the threshold that is
obtained by training data without LDoS attacks. The threshold Q is determined based
on the mean value of UTR and the standard deviation value of UTR and the formula is
Eq. 8. The value of z will be discussed in "Results analysis" section. If the UTR of a cluster
is larger than the threshold Q, it is determined that the cluster has suffered LDoS attacks.

Experiments and results analysis

Experiments are carried out in NS2 and test-bed to evaluate the efficiency and perfor-
mance of the detection method. For the purpose of further verifying the detection meth-
od’s performance, experiments are also performed in the public dataset WIDE [22] from
the perspective of evaluating the detection method’s false positive rate.

Experiments in NS2 simulation platform

Experimental network environment

Experiments are constructed in NS2 simulation platform and Figure 5 shows the net-
work topology. There are three routers in the simulation network, in which the link
bandwidth between Routerl and Router2 is 100Mbps and the delay is 15ms; the link
bandwidth between Router2 and Router3 is 1OMbps and the delay is 30ms, which is the
bottleneck link in the network. There are thirty legitimate TCP links in the network, and
TCP traffic is sent from nodel to node®8 via three routers; there are twenty background
TCP links, and TCP traffic is sent from node4 to node6 via Routerl and Router2; node2

sends legitimate UDP traffic to node9 via three routers; node5 sends background UDP
traffic to node7 via Routerl and Router2. Legitimate TCP traffic and legitimate UDP
traffic pass through the bottleneck link and background TCP traffic and background
UDP traffic do not pass through the bottleneck link.

Table 1 shows the parameters of LDoS attacks in NS2 simulation platform. The first
group is training data that contain 7200 s data without LDoS attacks; the second group
is testing data containing 3600 s data of which eight LDoS attacks occurred and each
attack lasted 180 s. The length of the detection unit is set as 3 s.

Results analysis
In this subsection, the experimental results are presented and discussed. Network traf-
fic passing through the bottleneck link is collected for analysis and detection. The nor-
malized variance and normalized Shannon entropy are used to characterize TCP traffic.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of testing data in two-dimensional space and data points
of TCP traffic with similar characteristics are distribute closer. Data points represent-
ing the traffic under LDoS attacks are generally distributed in space’s upper right corner,
and data points representing the traffic without LDoS attacks are generally distributed in
space’s lower left corner, which is consistent with the analysis of network traffic charac-
teristics in "Analysis of network traffic characteristics" section.

Figure 7 shows the UTR frequency distribution of training data, which approaches
the normal distribution. The mean value of UTR (jz) is about 0.44664 and the stand-
ard deviation value of UTR (oc) is about 0.00754. The value of the z in Eq. 8 affects the

accuracy of the UTR analysis and z is determined to be three in this paper, which 30
means a confidence interval of 99.7% [39]. According to Eq. 8, the threshold is about
0.46927. Figure 8 shows the results of BIRCH. Thirty sub-clusters are obtained and
data points with similar characteristics are aggregated in the same cluster. Figure 9
shows the change of WMSE with the number of clusters. The optimal number M
of clusters is determined to four according to the WMSE’s "elbow point". Figure 10
shows the results of the aggregation hierarchical clustering algorithm which is also
the results of two-step cluster analysis. Through two-step cluster analysis, the data
points with closer distance in the space are divided into the same cluster, which means
that data with similar characteristics are aggregated in the same cluster. Therefore,
TCP traffic suffered LDoS attacks will be concentrated in the same cluster. Figure 11
shows the results of UTR analysis, with the red dashed line indicating the threshold.
The UTRs of clusters 0, 2 and 3 are greater than the threshold, and the UTR of clus-
ter 1 is less than the threshold, which indicates that cluster 0, cluster 2 and cluster 3
have suffered LDoS attacks. There are nine detection units falsely reported as being
subjected to LDoS attacks. False positive detection units are 0, 500, 600, 700, 723,

traffic in detection unit 723 and TCP traffic in this unit is also discrete and unstable.
Because TCP traffic in these detection units is discrete and unstable, two-step cluster
analysis divides them into the same cluster as the detection unit subjected to LDoS
attacks. In "Results analysis" section, the detection performance in NS2 is compared
with that in test-bed, which proves the method is effective in detecting LDoS attacks.

Experiments in test-bed network environment
Experimental network environment
In addition to the simulation carried out in NS2 platform, experiments are also con-
ducted in test-bed network environment. Figure 13 shows the test-bed network environ-
ment topology which is a deformed dumbbell-like shape. It consists of two routers and
five hosts, in which three hosts simulate a legitimate user sending TCP traffic and UDP
traffic, one host simulates the LDoS attacker, and one host simulates the server that is
configured as a victim. Traffic sent by legitimate users and attackers reaches the server
via Routerl and Router2 whose link is the bottleneck link, and the bandwidth is 1OMbps.
Table 2 shows the detailed device configuration in test-bed network environment. The
operating system of PCs is windows 7 and python socket is used to generate network
traffic. Legitimate users are the hosts that send normal network traffic to the server. For
each legitimate user, there are multiple python socket threads sending network traffic.

The number of TCP socket threads in a host is the number of TCP connections from
that host to the server. If a host has five python socket threads sending TCP traffic to
the server, the host and server have five TCP connections. To comprehensively evaluate
the proposed approach, three groups of experiments with a different number of TCP
connections are carried out. Table 3 shows the experimental parameters. The difference
between the three groups of experiments is that the number of TCP connections on
each legitimate user is different. In experiment 1, the number of TCP connections for
a legitimate user to the server is five and the number in experiments 2 and 3 is ten and
fifteen, respectively. Table 4 shows the detail parameters of LDoS attacks in each group
of experiments. In each group of experiments, the training data contains 3600 s data that
is the network traffic without LDoS attacks and the testing data contains 1800 s data that
is the network traffic suffered LDoS attacks in which eight LDoS attacks occurred and
each attack lasted 90 s.

Results analysis

In this subsection, the experimental results are presented and discussed. Network
traffic is collected on the server for LDoS attacks detection. Figure 14 shows the UTR
frequency distribution of training data in three groups of experiments. As the figures
show, the UTR frequency distribution conforms to a normal distribution. In three
groups of experiments, the mean values of UTR (jz) are about 0.25003, 0.20719 and
0.19959, and the standard deviation values of UTR (c) are about 0.00539, 0.00347 and
0.00524. According to Eq. 8, the thresholds in three groups of experiments are about
0.26620, 0.21760 and 0.21532. Figure 15 shows the results of BIRCH, with thirty sub-
clusters obtained for each experiment. In three groups of experiments, data points
of TCP traffic with similar characteristics are in the same cluster as these data points

number of clusters increase. According to the "elbow point’, the optimal number M

of clusters in the three groups of experiments are determined to be three, four and

cluster analysis. Highly similar data points are divided into the same cluster since
their distances are closer. Figure 18 shows the results of UTR analysis. If the UTR
of a cluster is higher than the threshold represented by the red dashed line, it indi-
cates that the cluster has suffered LDoS attacks. In experiment 1, clusters 1 and 2 are
detected as suffered LDoS attacks; in experiment 2, clusters 0, 1 and 2 are detected
as suffered LDoS attacks; in experiment 3, clusters 0 and 1 are detected as suffered
LDoS attacks. In experiment 1, eight detection units are false positive reported and
no detection unit is false negative reported, which is the same as the detection results
in experiment 2. In experiment 3, eight detection units are false positive reported and
eleven detection units are false negative reported.

For evaluating the experimental results, six evaluation metrics are computed, which
is false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), fl-score, accuracy, precision and

recall measures.

¢ TP: ifa detection unit with LDoS attacks is detected to have suffered LDoS attacks, it
is accepted as TP.

¢ FP: if a detection unit without LDoS attacks is detected to have suffered LDoS
attacks, it is accepted as FP.

¢ TN: if a detection unit without LDoS attacks is detected to have not suffered LDoS
attacks, it is accepted as TN.

« FN: if a detection unit with LDoS attacks is detected to have not suffered LDoS

attacks, it is accepted as FN.

Table 5 shows the comparison of detection performance in the different experimental
platforms. The detection results in NS2 are more accurate than those in test-bed, and
the six evaluation metrics on both platforms are good. The comprehensive analysis of six
evaluation metrics proves that the detection method can detect LDoS attacks with good
performance.

To further and more comprehensively evaluate the performance and efficiency of the
proposed method, the experimental results are also compared with that of other detec-
tion methods. Table 6 shows a comparison of different detection methods. Our method
has an FPR of 0.0133 and an FNR of 0.0061. The FPR of our method is higher than that
of the wavelet feature extraction method [37] and the adaptive v-SVR method [40], but
lower than that of the multifractal method [19] and the KPCA method [30]. Although
the FPR of our method is not the lowest of these five methods, the FNR of our method is
the lowest, which proves that our detection method achieves good performance.

Experiments in public dataset WIDE

Since the experiments carried out in NS2 are based on simulation and the test-bed
experiments are also performed under experimental conditions, the effectiveness of
the proposed method needs to further verify. Since there is no suitable public database
containing LDoS attack data, the detection method is evaluated by testing false posi-
tive rate from another perspective. WIDE dataset maintained by the MAWI Working
Group is a traffic data repository and researchers can use it to evaluate their anomaly

detection methods. Network traffic used in the experiment is collected at the sample-
point-G which traces from the main IX link of WIDE to DIX-IE. Four days of 2018.01.16,
2018.01.23, 2018.02.06, and 2018.02.16 are selected, and a total of 3600 s of network data
traffic per day from 14:00 to 14:15 is used as training data. Two days of 2018.02.19 and
2018.03.10 are selected, and a total of 1800 s of network data traffic per day from 14:00
to 14:15 is used as testing data. Figure 19 shows the network traffic in 2018.01.16 from
14:00 to 14:15. The ratio of UDP traffic to TCP traffic is roughly maintained at a constant
level. Although the WIDE dataset does not contain any LDoS attack data, it can still be
used as a supplement to NS2 experiments and test-bed experiments for further verifying
the detection method’s effectiveness.

Figure 20 shows the UTR frequency distribution of the training data. The mean value
of UTR () is about 0.11235 and the standard deviation value (0) of UTR is about
0.04031. According to Eq. 8, the threshold is about 0.23327. Figure 21 shows the results
of BIRCH. A total of thirty sub-clusters are obtained through BIRCH and data points
with closer distance are in the same cluster. Figure 22 shows the change of WMSE with

the number of clusters. According to the “elbow point’, the optimal number / of clus-
ters is determined to be six. Figure 23 shows the results of the aggregation hierarchical
clustering algorithm that are also the results of two-step cluster analysis. As the figure
shows, data points in space are not very dispersed since the characteristics of TCP traffic
without LDoS attacks are similar. Figure 24 shows the results of UTR analysis, in which
the six clusters’ UTRs are all larger than the threshold, that is, no cluster is detected suf-
fered LDoS attacks, which is consistent with the true situation. The experimental results
without detecting LDoS attacks show that the false positive rate of the detection method

is low, which proves the good performance of the method.

Conclusion and future work

An LDoS attack detection method with good detection performance is proposed in this
paper. Two-step cluster analysis is used to divide traffic with similar characteristics into
the same cluster. Network traffic that has been subjected to LDoS attacks has similar
characteristics and is therefore aggregated into the same cluster. When an LDoS attack
occurs, the ratio of UDP traffic to TCP traffic changes, as LDoS attacks usually use the
UDP protocol. Therefore, UTR analysis is then used to determine which clusters have
suffered LDoS attacks.

NS2 simulation platform, test-bed network environment, and WIDE dataset are
used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed detection method. However, more
experiments are needed to further evaluate the detection method in the future, such
as SDN based experiments. The proposed method can only detect UDP based LDoS
attack vector, and the detection method against TCP based LDoS attack vector is
worthy of being studied in the future.
