of different financial products and services. Also, big data has significant impacts on
financial products and services. Therefore, identifying the financial issues where big
data has a significant influence is also an important issue to explore with the influ-
ences. Based on these concepts, the objective of this paper was to show the current
landscape of finance dealing with big data, and also to show how big data influences
different financial sectors, more specifically, its impact on financial markets, financial
institutions, and the relationship with internet finance, financial management, internet
credit service companies, fraud detection, risk analysis, financial application manage-
ment, and so on. The connection between big data and financial-related components
will be revealed in an exploratory literature review of secondary data sources. Since big
data in the financial field is an extremely new concept, future research directions will
be pointed out at the end of this study.

Introduction

In the age of technological innovation, various types of data are available with the
advance of information technologies, and data is seen as one of the most valuable com-
modities in managing automation systems [13, 68]. In this sense, financial markets and
technological evolution have become related to every human activity in the past few
decades. Big data technology has become an integral part of the financial services indus-
try and will continue to drive future innovation [12]. Financial innovations are also con-
sidered the fastest emerging issues in financial services. More specifically, they cover
a variety of financial businesses such as online peer-to-peer lending, crowd-funding
platforms, SME finance, wealth management and asset management platforms, trading
management, crypto-currency, money/remittance transfer, mobile payments platforms,

and so on. All of these services create thousands of pieces of data every day. Therefore,

managing this data is also considered the most important factor in these services. Any
damage to the data can cause serious problems for that specific financial industry. Nowa-
days, financial analysts use external and alternative data to make better investment deci-
sions. In addition, financial industries use big data through different predictive analyses
and monitor various spending patterns to develop large decision-making models. In this
way, the industries can decide which financial products to offer [29, 48]. Millions of data
are transmitted among financial companies. That is why big data is receiving more atten-
tion in the financial services arena, where information affects important success and
production factors. It has been playing increasingly important roles in consolidating our
understanding of financial markets [71]. In any case, the financial industry is using tril-
lions of pieces of data constantly in everyday decisions [22]. It plays an important role in
changing the financial services sector, particularly in trade and investment, tax reform,
fraud detection and investigation, risk analysis, and automation [37]. In addition, it has
changed the financial industry by overcoming different challenges and gaining valuable
insights to improve customer satisfaction and the overall banking experience [45]. Razin
[65] pointed out that big data is also changing finance in five ways: creating transpar-
ency, analyzing risk, algorithmic trading, leveraging consumer data and transforming
culture. Also, big data has a significant influence in economic analysis and economic
modeling [16, 21].

In this study, the views of different researchers, academics, and others related to
big data and finance activities have been collected and analysed. This study not only
attempts to test the existing theory but also to gain an in-depth understanding of the
research from the qualitative data. However, research on big data in financial services is
not as extensive as other financial areas. Few studies have precisely addressed big data
in different financial research contexts. Though some studies have done these for some
particular topics, the extensive views of big data in financial services haven't done before
with proper explanation of the influence and opportunity of big data on finance. There-
fore, the need to identify the finance areas where big data has a significant influence is
addressed. Also, the research related to big data and financial issues is extremely new.
Therefore, this study presents the emerging issues of finance where big data has a signifi-
cant influence, which has never been published yet by other researchers. That is why this
research explores the influence of big data on financial services and this is the novelty of
this study.

This paper seeks to explore the current landscape of big data in financial services.
Particularly this study highlights the influence of big data on internet banking, financial
markets, and financial service management. This study also presents a framework, which
will facilitate the way how big data influence on finance. Some other services relating to
finance are also highlighted here to specify the extended area of big data in financial ser-
vices. These are the contribution of this study in the existing literatures.

This result of the study contribute to the existing literature which will help readers
and researchers who are working on this topic and all target readers will obtain an inte-
grated concept of big data in finance from this study. Furthermore, this research is also
important for researchers who are working on this topic. The issue of big data has been
explored here from different financing perspectives to provide a clear understanding for
readers. Therefore, this study aims to outline the current state of big data technology
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 3 of 17

in financial services. More importantly, an attempt has been made to focus on big data
finance activities by concentrating on its impact on the finance sector from different

dimensions.

Literature review

The concept of big data in finance has taken from the previous literatures, where some
studies have been published by some good academic journals. At present, most of the
areas of business are linked to big data. It has significant influence on various perspec-
tives of business such as business process management, human resources management,
R&D management [8, 63], business analytics [19, 26, 42, 59, 63], B2B business process,
marketing, and sales [30, 39, 53, 58], industrial manufacturing process [7, 15, 40], enter-
prise’s operational performance measurement [20, 69, 81], policy making [2], supply
chain management, decision, and performance [4, 38, 64], and so other business arenas.

Particularly, Rabhi et al. [63] mentioned big data as a significant factor of business pro-
cess management& HR process to support the decision making. This study also talked
about three sophisticated types of analytics techniques such as descriptive analytics,
predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics in order to improve the traditional data
analytics process. Duan and Xiong [19], Grover and Kar [26], Ji et al. [42], and Pappas
et al. [59] also explored the significance of big data in business analytics. Big data helps
to solve business problems and data management through system infrastructure, which
includes any technique to capture, store, transfer, and process data. Duan and Xiong [19]
found that top-performing organizations use analytics as opposed to intuition almost
five times more than do the lower performers. Business analytics and business strategy
must be closely linked together to gain better analytics-driven insights. Grover and Kar
[26] mentioned about firms, like Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and eBay, that regu-
larly use digitized transaction data such as storing the transaction time, purchase quanti-
ties, product prices, and customer credentials on regular basis to estimate the condition
of their market for improving their business operations [61, 76]. Holland et al. [39]
showed the theoretical and empirical contributions of big data in business. This study
inferred that B2B relationships from consumer search patterns, which used to evaluate
and measure the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. Moreover,
big data also help to foster B2B sales with customer data analytics. The use of custom-
er’s big datasets significantly improve sales growth (monetary performance outcomes),
and enhances the customer relationship performance (non-monetary performance out-
comes) [30]. It also relates to market innovation with diversified opportunities.

Big data and its analytics and applications work as indicators of organizations’ ability
to innovate to respond to market opportunities [78]. Also, big data impact on industrial
manufacturing process to gain competitive advantages. After analyzing a case study of
two company, Belhadi et al. [7] stated ‘NAPC aims for a qualitative leap with digital
and big-data analytics to enable industrial teams to develop or even duplicate models
of turnkey factories in Africa: This study also identified an Overall framework of BDA
capabilities in manufacturing process, and mentioned some values of Big Data Analyt-
ics for manufacturing process, such as enhancing transparency, improving performance,
supporting decision-making and increasing knowledge. Also, Cui et al. [15] mentioned
four most frequently big data applications (Monitoring, prediction, ICT framework, and
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 4 of 17

data analytics) used in manufacturing. These are essential to realize the smart manu-
facturing process. Shamim et al. [69] argued that employee ambidexterity is important
because employees’ big data management capabilities and ambidexterity are crucial for
EMMNEs to manage the demands of global users. Also big data appeared as a frontier
of the opportunity in improving firm performance. Yadegaridehkordi et al. [81] hypoth-
esized that big data adoption has positive effect on firm performance. That study also
mentioned that the policy makers, governments, and businesses can take well-informed
decisions in adopting big data. According to Hofmann [38], velocity, variety, and volume
significantly influence on supply chain management. For example, at first, velocity offers
the biggest opportunity to intensification the efficiency of the processes in the supply
chain. Next to this, variety supports different types of data volume in the supply chains
is mostly new. After that, the volume is also a bigger interest for the multistage sup-
ply chains than to two-staged supply chains. Raman et al. [64] provided a new model,
Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR), by incorporating SCM with big data. This
model exposes the adoption of big data technology adds significant value as well as cre-
ates financial gain for the industry. This model is apt for the evaluation of the financial
performance of supply chains. Also it works as a practical decision support means for
examining competing decision alternatives along the chain as well as environmental
assessment. Lamba and Singh [50] focused on decision making aspect of supply chain
process and mentioned that data-driven decision-making is gaining noteworthy impor-
tance in managing logistics activities, process improvement, cost optimization, and bet-
ter inventory management. Sahal et al. [67] and Xu and Duan [80] showed the relation
of cyber physical systems and stream processing platform for Industry 4.0. Big data and
IoT are considering as much influential forces for the era of Industry 4.0. These are also
helping to achieve the two most important goals of Industry 4.0 applications (to increase
productivity while reducing production cost & to maximum uptime throughout the pro-
duction chain). Belhadi et al. [7] identified manufacturing process challenges, such as
quality & process control (Q&PC), energy & environment efficiency (E&EE), proactive
diagnosis and maintenance (PD&M), and safety & risk analysis (S&RA). Hofmann [38]
also mentioned that one of the greatest challenges in the field of big data is to find new
ways for storing and processing the different types of data. In addition, Duan and Xiong
[19] mentioned that big data encompass more unstructured data such as text, graph, and
time-series data compared to structured data for both data storage techniques and data
analytics techniques. Zhao et al. [86] identified two major challenges for integrating both
internal and external data for big data analytics. These are connecting datasets across the
data sources, and selecting relevant data for analysis. Huang et al. [40] raised four chal-
lenges, first, the accuracy and applicability of the small data-based PSM paradigms is
one kind of challenge; second, the traditional static-oriented PSM paradigms difficult to
adapt to the dynamic changes of complex production systems; third, it is urgent to carry
out research that focuses on forecasting-based PSM paradigms; and fourth, the deter-
mining the causal relationship quickly, economically and effectively is difficult, which
affects safety predictions and safety decision-making.

The above discussion based on different area of business. Whatever, some studies
(such as [6, 11, 14, 22, 23, 41, 45, 54, 68, 71, 73, 75, 83, 85] focused different perspec-
tives of financial services. Still, the contribution on this area is not expanded. Based
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 5 of 17

on those researches, the current trends of big data in finance have specified in finding

section.

Methodology

The purpose of this study is to locate academic research focusing on the related stud-
ies of big data and finance. To accomplish this research, secondary data sources were
used to collect related data [31, 32, 34]. To collect secondary data, the study used
the electronic database Scopus, the web of science, and Google scholar [33]. The key-
words of this study are big data finance, finance and big data, big data and the stock
market, big data in banking, big data management, and big data and FinTech. The
search mainly focused only on academic and peer-reviewed journals, but in some
cases, the researcher studied some articles on the Internet which were not pub-
lished in academic and peer-reviewed journals. Sometimes, information from search
engines helps understand the topic. The research area of big data has already been
explored but data on big data in finance is not so extensive; this is why we did not
limit the search to a certain time period because a time limitation may reduce the
scope of the area of this research. Here, a structured and systematic data collection
process was followed. Figure 1 presents the structured and systematic data collection
process of this study. Certain renowned publishers, for example, Elsevier, Springer,
Taylor & Francis, Wiley, Emerald, and Sage, among others, were prioritized when col-
lecting the data for this study [35, 36].

The number of related articles collected from those databases is only 180. Following
this, the collected articles were screened and a shortlist was created, featuring only
100 articles. Finally, data was used from 86 articles, of which 34 articles were directly
related to ‘Big data in Finance’. Table 1 presents the list of those journals which will
help to contribute to future research.

This literature study suggests that some major factors are related to big data and
finance. In this context, it has been found that these specific factors also have a deep
relationship with big data, such as financial markets, banking risk and lending, inter-
net finance, financial management, financial growth, financial analysis and application,
data mining and fraud detection, risk management, and other financial practices. Table 2
describes the focuses within the literature on the financial sector relating to big data.

Theoretical framework

After studying the literature, this study has found that big data is mostly linked to finan-
cial market, Internet finance. Credit Service Company, financial service management,
financial applications and so forth. Mainly data relates with four types of financial indus-
try such as financial market, online marketplace, lending company, and bank. These
companies produce billions of data each day from their daily transaction, user account,
data updating, accounts modification, and so other activities. Those companies process
the billions of data and take the help to predict the preference of each consumer given

his/her previous activities, and the level of credit risk for each user. Based on those data,

financial institutions help in taking decisions [84]. However, different financial compa-
nies processing big data and getting help for verification and collection, credit risk pre-
diction, and fraud detection. As the billions of data are producing from heterogeneous
sources, missing data is a big concern as well as data quality and data reliability is also
significant matter. Whatever, the concept of role of financial big data has taken form
[71], where that study mention the sources of financial market information include the
information assembled from stock market data (e.g., stock prices, stock trading volume,
interest rates, and so on), social media (e.g., Facebook, twitter, newspapers, advertising,
television, and so on). These data has significant roles in financial market such as pre-
dicting the market return, forecasting market volatility, valuing market position, iden-
tifying excess trading volume, analyzing the market risk, movement of the stock, option
pricing, algorithmic trading, idiosyncratic volatility, and so on. Based on these discus-
sions, a theoretical framework is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Results and discussion

Massive data and increasingly sophisticated technologies are changing the way indus-
tries operate and compete. The financial world is also operating with these big data
sets. It has not only influenced many fields of science and society, but has had an
important impact on the finance industry [6, 13, 23, 41, 45, 54, 62, 68, 71-73, 82, 85].
After reviewing the literature, this study found some financial areas directly linked
to big data, such as financial markets, internet credit service-companies and internet
finance, financial management, analysis, and applications, credit banking risk analy-
sis, risk management, and so forth. These areas are divided here into three groups;
first, big data implications for financial markets and the financial growth of compa-
nies; second, big data implications for internet finance and value creation in internet
credit-service companies; and third, big data in financial management, risk manage-

ment, financial analysis, and applications. The discussion of big data in these specified
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 10 of 17

financial areas is the contribution made by this study. Also, these are regarded as
emerging landscape of big data in finance in this study.

Big data implications on financial markets

Financial markets always seek technological innovation for different activities, espe-
cially technological innovations that are always positively accepted, and which have
a great impact on financial markets, and which have truly transforming effects on
them. Shen and Chen [71] explain that the efficiency of financial markets is mostly
attributed to the amount of information and its diffusion process. In this sense, social
media undoubtedly plays a crucial role in financial markets. In this sense, it is consid-
ered one of the most influential forces acting on them. It generates millions of pieces
of information every day in financial markets globally [9]. Big data mainly influences
financial markets through return predictions, volatility forecasts, market valuations,
excess trading volumes, risk analyses, portfolio management, index performance, co-
movement, option pricing, idiosyncratic volatility, and algorithmic trading.

Shen and Chen [71] focus on the medium effect of big data on the financial market.
This effect has two elements, effects on the efficient market hypothesis, and effects
on market dynamics. The effect on the efficient market hypothesis refers to the num-
ber of times certain stock names are mentioned, the extracted sentiment from the
content, and the search frequency of different keywords. Yahoo Finance is a com-
mon example of the effect on the efficient market hypothesis. On the other hand, the
effect of financial big data usually relies on certain financial theories. Bollen et al. [9]
emphasize that it also helps in sentiment analysis in financial markets, which repre-
sents the familiar machine learning technique with big datasets.

In another prospect, Begenau et al. [6] explore the assumption that big data strangely
benefits big firms because of their extended economic activity and longer firm history.
Even large firms typically produce more data compared to small firms. Big data also
relates corporate finance in different ways such as attracting more financial analysis,
as well as reducing equity uncertainty, cutting a firm’s cost of capital, and the costs of
investors forecasting related to a financial decision. It cuts the cost of capital as investors
process more data to enable large firms to grow larger. In pervasive and transformative
information technology, financial markets can process more data, earnings statements,
macro announcements, export market demand data, competitors’ performance met-
rics, and predictions of future returns. By predicting future returns, investors can reduce
uncertainty about investment outcomes. In this sense Begenau et al. [6] stated that
“More data processing lowers uncertainty, which reduces risk premia and the cost of capi-
tal, making investments more attractive.

Big data implications on internet finance and value creation at an internet credit service
company

Technological advancements have caused a revolutionary transformation in financial ser-
vices; especially the way banks and FinTech enterprises provide their services. Thinking
about the influence of big data on the financial sector and its services, the process can be
highlighted as a modern upgrade to financial access. In particular, online transactions,
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 11 of 17

banking applications, and internet banking produce millions of pieces of data in a single
day. Therefore, managing these millions of data is a subject to important [46]. Because
managing these internet financing services has major impacts on financial markets [57].
Here, Zhang et al. [85] and Xie et al. [79] focus on data volume, service variety, informa-
tion protection, and predictive correctness to show the relationship between information
technologies and e-commerce and finance. Big data improves the efficiency of risk-based
pricing and risk management while significantly alleviating information asymmetry prob-
lems. Also, it helps to verify and collect the data, predict credit risk status, and detect
fraud [24, 25, 56]. Jin et al. [44], [47], Peji [60], and Hajizadeh et al. [28] identified that data
mining technology plays vital roles in risk managing and fraud detection.

Big data also has a significant impact on Internet credit service companies. The first
impact is to be able to assess more borrowers, even those without a good financial sta-
tus. Big data also plays a vital role in credit rating bureaus. For example, the two pub-
lic credit bureaus in China only have 0.3 billion individual’s ‘financial records. For other
people, they at most have identity and demographic information (such as ID, name, age,
marriage status, and education level), and it is not plausible to obtain reliable credit risk
predictions using traditional models. This situation significantly limits financial institu-
tions from approaching new consumers [85]. In this case, big data benefits by giving the
opportunity for unlimited data access. In order to deal with credit risk effectively, finan-
cial systems take advantage of transparent information mechanisms. Big data can influ-
ence the market-based credit system of both enterprises and individuals by integrating
the advantages of cloud computing and information technology. Cloud computing is
another motivating factor; by using this cloud computing and big data services, mobile
internet technology has opened a crystal price formation process in non-internet-based
traditional financial transactions. Besides providing information to both the lenders and
borrowers, it creates a positive relationship between the regulatory bodies of both bank-
ing and securities sectors. If a company has a large data set from different sources, it
leads to multi-dimensional variables. However, managing these big datasets is difficult;
sometimes if these datasets are not managed appropriately they may even seem a burden
rather than an advantage. In this sense, the concept of data mining technology described
in Hajizadeh et al. [28] to manage a huge volume of data regarding financial markets
can contribute to reducing these difficulties. Managing the huge sets of data, the Fin-
Tech companies can process their information reliably, efficiently, effectively, and at a
comparatively lower cost than the traditional financial institutions. They can analyze and
provide services to more customers at greater depth. In addition, they can benefit from
the analysis and prediction of systemic financial risks [82]. However, one critical issue is
that individuals or small companies may not be able to afford to access big data directly.
In this case, they can take advantage of big data through different information compa-
nies such as professional consulting companies, relevant government agencies, relevant

private agencies, and so forth.

Big data in managing financial services

Big data is an emerging issue in almost all areas of business. Especially in finance, it
effects with a variety of facility, such as financial management, risk management, finan-
cial analysis, and managing the data of financial applications. Big data is expressively
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 12 of 17

changing the business models of financial companies and financial management. Also, it
is considered a fascinating area nowadays. In this fascinating area, scientists and experts
are trying to propose novel finance business models by considering big data methods,
particularly, methods for risk control, financial market analysis, creating new finance
sentiment indexes from social networks, and setting up information-based tools in dif-
ferent creative ways [58]. Sun et al. [73] mentioned the 4 V features of big data. These
are volume (large data scale), variety (different data formats), velocity (real-time data
streaming), and veracity (data uncertainty). These characteristics comprise different
challenges for management, analytics, finance, and different applications. These chal-
lenges consist of organizing and managing the financial sector in effective and efficient
ways, finding novel business models and handling traditional financial issues. The tra-
ditional financial issues are defined as high-frequency trading, credit risk, sentiments,
financial analysis, financial regulation, risk management, and so on [73].

Every financial company receives billions of pieces of data every day but they do not
use all of them in one moment. The data helps firms analyze their risk, which is consid-
ered the most influential factor affecting their profit maximization. Cerchiello and Giud-
ici [11] specified systemic risk modelling as one of the most important areas of financial
risk management. It mainly, emphasizes the estimation of the interrelationships between
financial institutions. It also helps to control both the operational and integrated risk.
Choi and Lambert [13] stated that ‘Big data are becoming more important for risk analy-
sis. It influences risk management by enhancing the quality of models, especially using
the application and behavior scorecards. It also elaborates and interprets the risk analy-
sis information comparatively faster than traditional systems. In addition, it also helps in
detecting fraud [25, 56] by reducing manual efforts by relating internal as well as exter-
nal data in issues such as money laundering, credit card fraud, and so on. It also helps
in enhancing computational efficiency, handling data storage, creating a visualization
toolbox, and developing a sanity-check toolbox by enabling risk analysts to make ini-
tial data checks and develop a market-risk-specific remediation plan. Campbell-verduyn
et al. [10] state “Finance is a technology of control, a point illustrated by the use of finan-
cial documents, data, models and measures in management, ownership claims, planning,
accountability, and resource allocation”.

Moreover, big data techniques help to measure credit banking risk in home equity
loans. Every day millions of financial operations lead to growth in companies’ databases.
Managing these big databases sometimes creates problems. To resolve those problems,
an automatic evaluation of credit status and risk measurements is necessary within a
reasonable period of time [62]. Nowadays, bankers are facing problems in measuring the
risks of credit and managing their financial databases. Big data practices are applied to
manage financial databases in order to segment different risk groups. Also big data is
very helpful for banks to comply with both the legal and the regulatory requirements in
the credit risk and integrity risk domains [12]. A large dataset always needs to be man-
aged with big data techniques to provide faster and unbiased estimators. Financial insti-
tutions benefit from improved and accurate credit risk evaluation. This helps to reduce
the risks for financial companies in predicting a client’s loan repayment ability. In this
way, more and more people get access to credit loans and at the same time banks reduce
their credit risks [62].

Big data and other financial issues

One of the largest data platforms is the Internet, which is clearly playing ever-increasing
roles in both the financial markets and personal finance. Information from the Internet
always matters. Tumarkin and Whitelaw [77] examine the relationship between Internet
message board activity and abnormal stock returns and trading volume. The study found
that abnormal message activity of the stock of the Internet sector changes investors’
opinions in correlation with abnormal industry-adjusted returns, as well as causing trad-
ing volume to become abnormally high, since the Internet is the most common chan-
nel for information dissemination to investors. As a result, investors are always seeking
information from the Internet and other sources. This information is mostly obtained by
searching on different search engines. Drake et al. [18] found that abnormal information
searches on search engines increase about two weeks prior to the earnings announce-
ment. This study also suggests that information diffusion is not instantaneous with the
release of the earnings information, but rather is spread over a period surrounding the
announcement. One more significant correlation identified in this study is that informa-
tion demand is positively associated with media attention and news, but negatively asso-
ciated with investor distraction. Dimpfl and Jank [17] specified that search queries help
predict future volatility, and their volatility will exceed the information contained in the
lag volatility itself, and the volatility of the search volume will have an impact on volatil-
ity, which will last a considerable period of time. Jin et al. [43] identified that micro blog-
ging also has a significant influence on changing the information environment, which in

turn influences changes in stock market behavior.

Conclusions

Big data, machine learning, AI, and the cloud computing are fueling the finance
industry toward digitalization. Large companies are embracing these technologies
to implement digital transformation, bolster profit and loss, and meet consumer
demand. While most companies are storing new and valuable data, the question is the
implication and influence of these stored data in finance industry. In this prospect,
every financial service is technologically innovative and treats data as blood circula-
tion. Therefore, the findings of this study are reasonable to conclude that big data has
revolutionized finance industry mainly with the real time stock market insights by
changing trade and investments, fraud detection and prevention, and accurate risk
analysis by machine learning process. These services are influencing by increasing
revenue and customer satisfaction, speeding up manual processes, improving path
to purchase, streamlined workflow and reliable system processing, analyze financial
performance, and control growth. Despite these revolutionary service transmissions,
several critical issues of big data exist in the finance world. Privacy and protection
of data is one the biggest critical issue of big data services. As well as data quality of
data and regulatory requirements also considered as significant issues. Even though
every financial products and services are fully dependent on data and producing data
in every second, still the research on big data and finance hasn't reached its peak
stage. In this perspectives, the discussion of this study reasonable to settle the future
research directions. In future, varied research efforts will be important for finan-
cial data management systems to address technical challenges in order to realize the
Hasan et al. J Big Data (2020) 7:21 Page 14 of 17

promised benefits of big data; in particular, the challenges of managing large data sets
should be explored by researchers and financial analysts in order to drive transform-
ative solutions. The common problem is that the larger the industry, the larger the
database; therefore, it is important to emphasize the importance of managing large
data sets for large companies compared to small firms. Managing such large data sets
is expensive, and in some cases very difficult to access. In most cases, individuals or
small companies do not have direct access to big data. Therefore, future research may
focus on the creation of smooth access for small firms to large data sets. Also, the
focus should be on exploring the impact of big data on financial products and ser-
vices, and financial markets. Research is also essential into the security risks of big
data in financial services. In addition, there is a need to expand the formal and inte-
grated process of implementing big data strategies in financial institutions. In par-
ticular, the impact of big data on the stock market should continue to be explored.
Finally, the emerging issues of big data in finance discussed in this study should be

empirically emphasized in future research.
