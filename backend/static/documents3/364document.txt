Abstract

In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained convincing research ground
as anew research topic in a wide variety of academic and industrial disciplines, espe-
cially in healthcare. The IoT revolution is reshaping modern healthcare systems by
incorporating technological, economic, and social prospects. It is evolving health-
care systems from conventional to more personalized healthcare systems through
which patients can be diagnosed, treated, and monitored more easily. The current
global challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel severe respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 presents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic
influenza outbreak of 1918. At the time this paper was written, the number of diag-
nosed COVID-19 cases around the world had reached more than 31 million. Since
the pandemic started, there has been a rapid effort in different research communi-
ties to exploit a wide variety of technologies to combat this worldwide threat, and
IoT technology is one of the pioneers in this area. In the context of COVID-19,
loT-enabled/linked devices/applications are utilized to lower the possible spread of
COVID-19 to others by early diagnosis, monitoring patients, and practicing defined
protocols after patient recovery. This paper surveys the role of IoT-based technologies
in COVID-19 and reviews the state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, applications,
and industrial IoT-based solutions combating COVID-19 in three main phases,
including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.

1 Introduction

The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) was first coined in a presentation by Kevin
Ashton about implementing radio-frequency identification (RFID) in the Procter and
Gamble company for supply chain management [1]. IoT is an advanced technology
that can link all smart objects together within a network with no human interac-
tions [2]. More simply, any object that can be connected to the internet for further
monitoring or transferring data can be an IoT device [3].

In recent years, IoT has gained convincing research ground as a new research topic
in a wide variety of academic and industrial disciplines, especially in healthcare. The
IoT revolution is reshaping modern healthcare systems, incorporating technological,
economic, and social prospects. It is evolving healthcare systems from conventional
to more personalized healthcare systems through which patients can be diagnosed,
treated, and monitored more easily.

IoT is increasingly becoming a vital technology in healthcare systems where it
can deliver lower expenses, a better quality of services, and advanced user experi-
ences [4—7]. As a result of its wide capabilities including tracking, identification and
authentication, and data collection, the exponential growth of IoT in healthcare is
expected to rise from USD 72 billion in 2020 to USD 188 billion in 2025 [2, 8].

The current global challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel severe respi-
ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents the greatest global public health crisis since
the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918 [9]. According to the last report of the
World Health Organization (WHO), as of September 2020, the number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases passed 31 million people with an approximate huge death toll of
960,000 people [10]. This disease has similar symptoms as the flu such as fever,
cough, and fatigue, which are essential to recognize for early diagnosis [11]. The
incubation period of COVID-19 takes from 1 to 14 days. Surprisingly, a patient with-
out any symptoms can possibly be a transmitter of the COVID-19 virus to others. This
is when quarantining such people is necessary [12]. Moreover, the recovery period of
this disease varies and depends on the patient’s age, underlying conditions, etc., but
in general it can take between 6 to 41 days [13]. While this disease has a high poten-
tial to be spread easily in comparison with similar diseases within the coronavirus
family, there are many ongoing efforts and much research to mitigate the spread of
this virus. In this context, IoT technology has been shown to be a safe and efficient
way of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic [14—16].

Our goal in this study is to determine the role of IoT-based technologies in
COVID-19 tracking and control and review the state-of-the-art architectures, plat-
forms, applications, and industrial IoT-based solutions combating COVID-19 in three
main phases, including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.

Early detection and diagnosis can lead to fewer infection and, as a result, better
health services for infected patients [17]. Quarantining confirmed or suspected cases
and enforcing lockdowns can also decrease the number of COVID-19 infections by
separating infected people from others. Tracking COVID-19 patients after recovery
will benefit the monitoring of returning symptoms and the potential infectivity of
these recovered cases [18].

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers the impor-
tance of IoT during COVID-19. Section 3 highlights IoT technologies along with
their categories for the phase of “Early Diagnosis.” Similarly, Section 4 and 5
review IoT technologies in “Quarantine Time” and “After Recovery” phases respec-
tively. Finally, we discuss, outline future work, and conclude in Sections 6 and 7
respectively.

2 Important Role of loT in COVID-19

Since early 2020, the world has been struggling with the pandemic caused by the
novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by striving to control the unprece-
dented spread of the virus and develop a vaccine [19]. As most efforts to find a
treatment or control the spread of the COVID-19 have not shown acceptable results
so far, there is a high demand for global monitoring of patients with symptomatic and
asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.

In recent years, IoT technology has received significant attention in the healthcare
domain where it plays an important role in different phases of various infectious
diseases [20]. In the current pandemic, as the contingency of COVID-19 is high,
there is an essential need for patients to be connected with and monitored by their
physicians proactively in different phases of COVID-19. In this study, we investigate
the role of IoT technology in response to COVID-19 in three main phases including
early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.

During the first phase of COVID-19, which is early diagnosis [21], there is an
essential need for faster diagnosis due to the high rate of contagiousness of COVID-
19 where even an asymptomatic patient can easily spread the virus to others. The
sooner the patient is diagnosed, the better the spread of the virus can be controlled,
and the patient can receive appropriate treatment. In fact, lol devices can speed up
the detection process by capturing information from patients. This can be imple-
mented by capturing body temperatures using different devices, taking samples from
suspicious cases, and so on.

The second phase, called quarantine time [22], is an important period of this dis-
ease after the patient has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and he or she should be
isolated for the course of treatment. IoT devices in this phase can monitor patients
remotely [23] with respect to their treatments and stay at home orders by the author-
ities. They can also clean areas without human interactions. Examples of these types
are the implementation of tracking wearable bands, disinfecting devices, etc.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [24], most
people with mild symptoms can recover while staying at home without getting treat-
ments, but there is no guarantee those people will not be reinfected after recovery.
Reinfection might happen with different symptoms of COVID-19 [25]. Concern-
ing these possible reinfections in the after recovery phase, the chances of returning
symptoms and potential infectivity can be high [18]. To prevent that happening,
social distancing should be implemented by deploying IoT devices, including bands

and crowd monitoring devices, to track people to ensure the appropriate distance is
maintained. In short, loT technology during the COVID-19 pandemic has proven its
usefulness in assisting patients, healthcare providers, and authorities. In this section,
we briefly explain the various IoT devices and applications including wearables,
drones, robots, [oT buttons, and smartphone applications that are mainly utilized
in the forefront of combating COVID-19. Table | lists the specifications of these
technologies regarding this pandemic.

2.1 Wearables

Wearable technologies can be defined as the combination of electronics with any-
thing that is able to be worn [26]. The definition presented by Juniper Research [27]
describes them as app-enabled computing technologies that receive and process input
while they are either worn or stick to the body such as bands, glasses, and watches.
These smart wearables were designed for different purposes in various domains such
as healthcare, fitness, lifestyle, and so on [27—29]. Although the privacy of data is
still a significant issue for expanding these devices, it 1s predicted that healthcare
providers will spend $20 billion annually until 2023 on wearable IoT devices to mon-
itor more patients [30]. loT wearable devices cover a wide range of different smart
wearable tools such as Smart Themormeters [31, 32], Smart Helmets [33], Smart
Glasses [34], IoT-Q-Band [35], EasyBand [36], and Proximity Trace [37]. Table 2
shows all wearable devices regarding their classification with examples.

2.2 Drones

Drones are simply aircraft that are flown without any or very little human operation
by remote monitoring [38]. In 1849, during a war between Italy and Austria, the first
drone, which was a balloon equipped with bombs, was used [39]. The drone is also
known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that works with the help of sensors,
GPS, and communication services. The implementation of IoT within drones, known
as the Internet of Drone Things (loDT), makes it possible for drones to do a vari-
ety of tasks such as searching, monitoring, and delivering [40, 41]. Smart drones can
be operated by a smartphone and a controller with a minimum of time and energy,
which makes them efficient in different fields such as agriculture, the military, and
healthcare. Different types of IoT-based drones, including thermal imaging drone
[42], disinfectant drone [43], medical drone [44], surveillance drone [45], announce-
ment drone [46], and multipurpose drone [47] are used in the healthcare domain
and, in particular, in the fight against COVID-19, will be discussed in this paper.
An illustration of these types of drones, along with their examples, can be found in
Table 3.

2.3 Robots
According to the Merriam Webster dictionary [48], a robot is defined as “a machine

that resembles a living creature in being capable of moving independently.” As
an advancement during the emergence of networked robots within the cloud, the

Internet of Robot Things was implemented where they can do many different tasks
to make life easier [49]. Regarding the current pandemic, robots can be categorized
as Autonomous robots [50], Telerobots [51], Collaborative robots [52], and Social
robots [53]. Table 4 covers the fundamental aspects of these robots with examples.

2.4 loT Buttons

This type of IoT device is a small, programmable button connected to the cloud
through wireless communication [54]. Based on its written code on the cloud,
this device can perform different repetitive tasks by pressing only one button.
For example, one type of IoT button enables patients to complain if any hospital
restrooms need cleaning by pressing a button only [55, 56]. Table 5 illustrates two
implementations of these buttons during COVID-19 phases.

2.5 Smartphone Applications

Smartphone applications are application software designed to do limited tasks within
a mobile device such as a smartphone [57, 58]. Since there are 3.5 billion active
smartphones in 2020, these IoT-based smartphone applications could be very effi-
cient in various domains such as healthcare, retail, and agriculture [59-62]. Many
smartphone applications have been developed for the healthcare domain, and some
of them have been used in response to COVID-19, as illustrated in Table 6, namely
nCapp [63], DetectaChem [64], Stop Corona [65], Social Monitoring [66], Selfie
app [67], Civitas [68], StayHomeSafe [69], AarogyaSetu [70], TraceTogether [71],
Hamagen [72], Coalition [73], BeAware Bahrain [74], eRouska [75], and Whatsapp
[76].

3 Phase I: Early Diagnosis

The key to combating COVID-19 is to diagnose it early to prevent spreading the virus
widely. This will substantially help healthcare providers to arrange better treatment
plans, save more lives, and reduce contamination and infections [77]. The first step
in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 is understanding its symptoms. According to the
CDC [11], as of September 2020, COVID-19 has a wide range of symptoms includ-
ing fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle
or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or
runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Among them, fever or high body tem-
perature is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 when the measured
temperature exceeds 38 °C or 100.4 °F [78]. IoT devices can make the detection
process faster and more efficient by capturing data within their sensors and then ana-
lyzing the data for patients, healthcare providers, and authorities to diagnose, control,
and ultimately stop this contagious disease [79]. Different IoT devices can be used
to capture some of the aforementioned symptoms at an early stage, which will be
discussed in the next subsections.

3.1 Wearables

Using wearable devices is considered an efficient way to respond to the need for early
diagnosis during this pandemic [80]. Developing these devices has had a remarkable
impact on the early detection of diseases. For example, a wearable IoT device can
confirm whether respiratory signs of a patient are normal or not. With this knowledge,
the patient can notice any changes in his or her health situation and then decide to
make a medical appointment before any other symptoms appear [81]. In fact, the
COVID-19 pandemic might be easier to fight using appropriate wearable devices.

3.1.1 Smart Thermometers

A wide range of IoT smart thermometers has been developed to record constant mea-
surements of body temperatures. These low-cost, accurate, easy to use devices can
be worn or stick to the skin under clothing [32]. They are usually offered in dif-
ferent forms such as touch, patch, and radiometric [32]. The use of these devices
can be extremely helpful in the early detection of suspicious cases. Also, since the
use of infrared thermometers for capturing body temperature can possibly spread the
virus more due to the closeness of patients and healthcare providers, using smart
thermometers is highly recommended [42].

According to [82], Kinsa’s thermometers have been widely used in homes, and
the producer is now able to predict the most suspicious areas (contaminated with
COVID-19) in each state of the USA based on the recorded temperature of people
[31, 83-85]. Other smart thermometers such as Tempdrop, Ran’s Night, iFever, and
iSense (shown in Fig. 1) can report body temperature at any time on a smartphone.
Using these devices in people’s daily lives can improve the chance of diagnosing new
patients at an early stage.

3.1.2 Smart Helmet

During the COVID-19 pandemic, using wearable smart helmets with a thermal cam-
era has proven to be safer compared to an infrared thermometer gun due to lower
human interactions [42]. In this device, when a high temperature is detected by the
thermal camera on the smart helmet, the location and the image of the person’s face
are taken by an optical camera. Then, they are sent to the assigned mobile device
with an alarm as shown in Fig. 2, so that a health officer can distinguish the infected
person, and authorities can act [33]. Additionally, Google Location History can be
incorporated with the smart helmet to find the places visited by the suspected person

after detection [86]. Countries such as China, UAE, and Italy have implemented this
wearable device to monitor crowds within 2 m from passers-by [87]. Interestingly,
this model has shown good results. For example, KC N901 is a smart helmet pro-
duced in China that has an accuracy of 96 percent for high body temperature detection
[87].

3.1.3 Smart Glasses

Another type of wearable device is the IoT-based smart glasses as shown in Fig. 3.
In comparison with thermometer guns, smart glasses have lesser human interactions.
Optical and thermal cameras have been used in smart glasses to monitor crowds
[34], and the inbuilt face detection technology makes the tracking procedure easier
after detecting suspicious cases. In fact, this allows detecting the identification of
the suspicious case (person with a high temperature). Additionally, Google Location
History can empower further actions with more reliability by capturing the places
visited by the suspicious case [34]. Among different smart glasses, Rokid [88], smart
glasses with infrared sensors, can monitor up to 200 people. Another example of
this device is the combination of Vuzix smart glasses with the Onsight Cube thermal
camera (see Fig. 4). These devices work together to monitor crowds to detect people

3.2 Drones

In general, finding infected people in a crowd is important in early diagnosis and
control of COVID-19 [95]. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and, especially,
IoT-based drones is another common way to speed up the process of finding con-
taminated people and zones during this pandemic. Drone technology can reduce
human interactions and can reach hard-to-access locations [96]. The thermal imag-
ing drone as shown in Fig. 5 was designed for capturing the temperature of people
in crowds and can be used in the early diagnosis phase. This type of drone can be

Fig.4 Vuzix smart glass [94]

combined with Virtual Reality as a wearable device to identify people with high tem-
peratures (fevers). This device not only reduces human interactions, but it also uses
less time compared to thermometer gun devices [42]. One example of this device is
the Pandemic Drone application developed by a Canadian company [97] for remote
monitoring and detecting any cases of infection by capturing temperature, respiratory
signs such as heart rate, and any sneezing or coughing [98, 99].

3.3 Robots

Using robots linked to IoT to assist early diagnosis is a remarkable use of these
devices because they can help health workers by processing patients’ treatments and
lowering work stress levels [107]. Without the interaction of humans, the autonomous
robot can help fight in all COVID-19 phases. In the first phase, it can help the process
of diagnosis by collecting throat swabs samples from patients with the advantage of
preventing medical staff at risk (close contact with patients) [50]. Figure 6 depicts
how this process works. An example of this device, the Intelligent Care Robot, has
been developed through a partnership between two companies, Vayyar Imaging [108]
and Meditemi [109]. This device detects symptoms of COVID-19 in 10 seconds

3.4 loT Buttons

An [oT Button, in general, is a programmable device that can be used for repetitive
tasks. During this pandemic, IoT buttons can play an important role in alerting the
authorities or family of a patient about any contaminated area or any emergency. For
example, an IoT button produced by Visionstate [118], called Wanda QuickTouch
(Fig. 7), was deployed as a cleaning alert system in hospitals. They are designed for
alerting authorities in case of any concerns related to essential sanitation or public
safety.

3.5 Smartphone Applications

Smartphone applications enabled with IoT using information such as Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) for tracking
purposes have been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to increase
the chance of detecting infected people [60]. Implementing smartphone applications
using the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will assist patients by providing them
proper treatments while they are home. Additionally, it enables healthcare workers
and authorities to monitor patients and the spread of disease more easily. People can
upload their health information to the cloud adopted by IoT and get health advice
from hospitals online. Using this platform, patients can be cured at home without
expanding the contamination. It costs less than having a physical appointment at hos-
pitals and allows the governments to take better action to manage the pandemic in
the future [123]. Since the start of the pandemic, some smartphone applications have
been developed for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. These will be discussed in
the coming sections.

3.5.1 nCapp

COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp) was
developed in China using Internet of Medical Things on a cloud platform. This cell-
phone application is an automated diagnosis system with eight functions that can
be selected by the user. nCapp can automatically generate a diagnosis report based
on requested data and questionnaires submitted by patients. Diagnosis is categorized
into three cases: confirmed, suspected, or suspicious. For the confirmed cases, there
are four conditions, including “mild, moderate, severe, and critical,’ which are deter-
mined by a physician. Special treatments for these conditions and other types of cases
are defined as well. Other positive points of this program include updating its own
database in order to improve its diagnosis, making consultation possible for all health
workers, making sure all patients are safe in the long term, and finally, having all
these abilities publicly available. In general, by using nCapp, the diagnosis can be
done faster and the spread of disease can be controlled more easily [63].

3.5.2 MobileDetect

The high demand for a system that can identify infected people has led to the imple-
mentation of MobileDetect, app [64]. MobileDetect which is compatible with a wide
variety of smartphones, is designed to detect and control the spread of COVID-19.
Using this application, users can easily take the test at home utilizing a nasal swab.
The results of the test will show up on the smartphone application within 10—30 min
determining the user’s health situation regarding COVID-19. Then, the user can send

g) Springer
342 Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research (2020) 4:325-364

the results with any additional information needed to his or her physician or health-
care professional for further action. This smartphone testing kit authorized by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency access can be helpful during
the first phase of a pandemic by lowering the spread of the virus [64, 124].

3.5.3 Stop Corona

Besides all the implementations for early case detection, another approach is having
a database of captured daily health reports. The reports include contact with oth-
ers, Symptoms, and locations. The Stop Corona application [65] provides predictive
heatmaps based on the disease spots. This application collects information from its
users about their daily health status and generate reports and heatmaps based on that.
The generated reports will be accessible only to health authorities. Consequently,
once a user shows a new symptom and announces it, the case will appear on the new
report, and ultimately authorities will be able to take proper action and detect the
contaminated area more quickly due to the reported new symptoms.

4 Phase II: Quarantine Time

After the process of detection, it is necessary to isolate and then monitor the patients
either in a hospital or at home. The quarantine does not only apply to confirmed
cases but also can be considered for suspected patients and even different areas or
cities or countries [12]. This is done to prevent possible transmission from suspected
cases (asymptomatic cases) or areas to others. Using IoT devices in this phase could
help mitigate serious challenges such as spreading the virus by monitoring patients
efficiently and controlling their respiratory signs, heart rate, blood pressure, and so
on [125-127].

4.1 Wearables

Quarantine time for confirmed or suspected cases is vital because there is a chance
of spreading the virus to other people by those cases [22]. IoT wearable bands
have shown promising results to prevent patients from leaving quarantine areas.
Using wearable bands is a cost-effective solution for tracking cases. This device is
connected to a patience’s, smartphone application through Bluetooth during the quar-
antine period, and healthcare authorities can usually monitor all cases every 2 minutes
using a web interface. Additionally, if a patient does not have the band on his or her
arm or leg, or maybe leaves the quarantine area, an alert will be sent to notify the
authorities, and they have permission to call the patient for clarification of the situ-
ation. Figure 8 shows a wearable band, called IoT-Q-Band, workflow process. This
approach has been deployed in Hong Kong, where authorities use an electronic wrist-
band linked with a smartphone application in order to track new arrivals at the airports
for 14 days [69, 128, 129]. Similarly, authorities in the United States have imple-
mented another type of this model using electronic ankle bracelets (ankle monitors)
in order to isolate people who refuse to stay in quarantine [130, 131].

4.2 Drones

Using drones plays an important role during a quarantine to decrease the number of
COVID-19 cases by lowering the interaction of healthcare workers with patients and
contaminated areas. For example, drones in this phase can assist healthcare workers
and patients by disinfecting areas or delivering medical treatments to patients [132].

4.2.1 Disinfectant Drone

Keeping areas sanitized and disinfected during a quarantine is very important, and
this can be achieved by using a particular type of drone, called a disinfectant drone
[101] (see Fig. 9). These drones can reduce the contamination of the virus and prevent
healthcare workers from getting infected. DJI company produced this drone with the
ability to disinfect 100 meters in | hour. This type of drone has also been used in
Spain for disinfecting purposes [100].

4.2.2 Medical/Delivery Drone

Medical drones have shown their efficiency at the early stage of COVID-19 where
they transfer the COVID-19 test kits, samples, or medical supplies between labs and
medical centers to eliminate human interactions. Additionally, this type of drones
usually reduces hospital visits and increases access to medical care by delivering
medical treatments to patients or another medical center rapidly. For example, using

g) Springer
344 Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research (2020) 4:325-364

 

Fig.9 Disinfectant drone [96]

medical drones in China and Ghana has increased the speed of diagnosis by cutting
delivery time [102, 133]. Another type of delivery drone during COVID-19, produced
by Delivery Drone Canada Inc., can move COVID-related goods, including test kits
and swab tests [104]. This type of drone can be also used for other purposes such
as postal and grocery services while COVID-19 confirmed cases are isolated in their
homes during a quarantine [103, 134]. Figure 10 illustrates this type of drone.

4.3 Robots
During a quarantine, robots play an important role in keeping medical staff away

from isolated patients [135]. For example, robots can be used in different ways, such
as capturing respiratory signs and assisting patients with their treatments or food.

 

Fig.10 Medical drone transferring medical related [96]

Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research (2020) 4:325-364 345

4.3.1 Telerobots

Telerobots are usually operated remotely by a human and can provide different ser-
vices such as remote diagnosis, remote surgeries, and remote treatments for the
patients with no human interaction during the process [136]. For example, a nurse
can measure patients’ temperatures without having interactions with them by using
these robots. Another example is the DaVinci surgical robot, which is operated by
a surgeon while the patient is in the safe isolation of plastic sheeting. This helps to
prevent infections by performing surgeries remotely [51, 115]. Figure 11 shows the
actual daVinci telerobot.

4.3.2 Collaborative Robots

Collaborative robots, known as Cobots (Fig. 12), are recommended robots if there is
a need for an operation performed by humans. They are not as beneficial as telerobots
for this pandemic, but during a quarantine, this type of robot can lower healthcare
workers’ fatigue as well as track their interactions with patients [51]. For instance,
Asimov Robotics in India is designed for a quarantine to help patients in isolated
areas with tasks such as preparing food and providing medication and also preventing
healthcare workers from being in that area [52, 116]. Another example of this robot
during this phase is the eXtreme Disinfection robot (XDBOT) (shown in Fig. 13)
which is implemented by Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. This robot
can disinfect hard to access areas, such as under a bed, and can be wirelessly operated
on a mobile platform to avoid any close contact between humans and contaminated
areas [52, 138].

4.3.3 Autonomous Robots

Autonomous robots have been widely used during quarantines. They work with fewer
or no human interactions and can be utilized in different scenarios in order to sterilize
contaminated areas in hospitals, carry patients’ treatments, and check their respira-
tory signs. These will result in decreasing the risk of infection for the healthcare
workers while the patients are isolated in their rooms [51, 112]. For example, the
disinfection robot created by Xenex [113] is capable of cleaning and disinfecting
areas of viruses and bacteria. Figure 14 illustrates how the Xenex robot breaks down
the virus using UV lights. Another example is UVD robots developed by a Danish
company that are used for disinfecting hospitals with their strong UV light, which
destroys the DNA of the virus [114].

4.3.4 Social Robots

According to the CDC [141], isolating and quarantining patients can potentially cause
mental health problems. To prevent this, social robots are designed to communicate
with patients during that time. The functionality of these robots in this pandemic is
to help reduce mental fatigue and strain during a quarantine and period of physical
distancing [51]. One example of these robots is Paro [53], which can help patients
during their isolation as a stress-relief device, as shown in Fig. 15.

4.4 loT Buttons

The use of the IoT button in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can help to track
patients during a quarantine. The Sefucy IoT button [122] was originally designed

 

Fig.15 Paro social robot can prevent mental effects of quarantine [53]

g) Springer
348 Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research (2020) 4:325-364

for tracking lost or missing children, but with the outbreak of COVID-19, this IoT
device has been used for emergency notifications during a quarantine. If the health
condition of a confirmed case isolated at home gets worse, by pressing the button, a
healthcare provider will be alerted, or family members will be notified in case of an
emergency.

4.5 Smartphone Applications

The most critical part of a quarantine is keeping track of patients while they are
isolated. Tracking patients using smartphones during a quarantine is another widely
used approach to mitigate and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

4.5.1 Social Monitoring

In Russia, a mandatory surveillance application called Social Monitoring [66]
has been developed by the government to track patients who are diagnosed with
COVID-19 and must be isolated in their homes. Using this approach, authorities can
track patients after the application is installed on the patients’ smartphones. Patients
are required to ask for a QR (Quick Response) code every time they want to leave
home or quarantine areas. This code represents their identification to the authorities,
which allows them to monitor patients [128, 142, 143].

4.5.2 Selfie App

This application was developed in Poland integrated with Geo-location and facial
recognition technology to track patients who have been told to stay at home for 14
days. Patients can refuse to install this application, but in return, they will get unex-
pected visits from authorities. Using the application, patients will be asked to send
selfies randomly everyday [67, 144, 145].

4.5.3 Civitas

Civitas is a Canadian smartphone application that has been proposed to lower
COVID-19’s impact. Using the user’s identification code, this application communi-
cates with the authorities to request a permit that allows the user to leave the house.
Civitas can assist suspected cases who need to go outside to buy essential goods in a
timely manner. Furthermore, it provides a secure channel that enables physicians to
contact patients to monitor their health status [68, 146].

4.5.4 The StayHomeSafe

StayHomeSafe application is considered as a combination of smartphone applica-
tions and wearable devices [69]. It has been implemented in Hong Kong where new
arrivals at airports are given a wristband that can be paired with a smartphone to
set the quarantine location with the advantage of geofencing technology used by the
application [128].

5 Phase Ill: After Recovery

The restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a
devastating effect on many businesses, marketplaces, and economics. After months
of locked down societies and harsh restrictions, nations are gradually and carefully
opening again. This is the phase during which everyone needs to experience with
extra caution. Social distancing and restrictions on physical services need to be imple-
mented in a way to make sure the virus will not spread again [152]. In this section,
we highlight the role of IoT technology in combating the COVID-19 pandemic after
lockdown.

5.1 Wearables

Since employers are gradually bringing workers back to the work, students are return-
ing to schools, and the economy is bouncing back during reopening, there should be
some protection techniques in order to keep everyone safe from this virus. Contact
tracing and social distancing are two key points to be considered for safely reopen-
ing. Wearables are the devices that can be utilized to trace users’ close contacts with
other people and alert them if social distancing is not maintained [153].

5.1.1 EasyBand

As countries gradually reopen workplaces and marketplaces after the lockdown,
EasyBand [36] is one of the most effective IoT devices to make sure people are prac-
ticing social distancing. This wearable device, which is integrated with the Internet
of Medical Things (IoMT), senses and captures data from other devices. EasyBand
works within a specific radius and shows potential risk by its LED lights if people are
very close to each other. For instance, if someone wearing an Easyband gets within 4
meters of another person, the band will start beeping to alert both and remind them to
keep the appropriate distance from each other. This device has shown better results
compared to smartphone apps, and it can be used without any mobile devices. Addi-
tionally, it is a cost-effective device that gives people a greater sense of safety and
peace of mind. Figure 16 represents the workflow of this wearable. A similar example
for this device is Pact wristband [89] (see Fig. 17), which alerts the distance between
people using a vibrator and buzzer.

5.1.2 Proximity Trace

As industrial workers are coming back to work after the lockdown, there is an essen-
tial need for practicing social distancing between them while they work together.
Proximity Trace [37] helps industrial workers maintain social distancing in practical
ways. This device, which can be attached to a hard hat or body, alerts workers when
they get close to each other with a loud sound. Using this device, workers will be able
to concentrate on their work without worrying about contamination from the virus.
Figure 18 shows how this trace can stick to the industrial workers’ hard hat. Also,

employees to maintain social distancing and trace an infected employee’s contacts [92].

5.2 Drones

As the pandemic enters the After Recovery phase, many drones have been used in
response to the reopening, which helps businesses continue working in a safe manner.
Increasing social awareness by monitoring crowds and broadcasting information is
the main purpose of implementing these devices during this phase [154].

5.2.1 Surveillance Drone

The Surveillance drone was designed and developed as an effective way to monitor
crowds in case of people’s failure to do social distancing. MicroMultiCopter, [46]
made in China, and Cyient [105] from India are two types of this drone (Fig. 20). The
MicroMultiCopter drone has also been equipped with speakers to announce impor-
tant information from the authorities, which will be discussed in the next type of
drone within this phase.

5.2.2 Announcement Drone

This type of drone is mainly designed for broadcasting in areas with low accessibil-
ity to the Internet. For example, authorities in Spain and other European countries
used this type of drone to announce the practice of social distancing and other
guidelines with loudspeakers [100, 106]. Kuwait is another country that used this
drone to broadcast “go home” messages to people in crowds [134] (see Fig. 21).

5.2.3 Multipurpose Drone

A multipurpose drone, called Corona Combat [47], has been implemented in China
with the combination of all other types of drones that can cover all of the proposed
goals aforementioned in the three phases at once. This drone can be deployed in any
COVID-19 phase. Figure 22 shows this drone with all the characteristics from other
drones.

5.3 Robots
As schools are opening, businesses are recovering, cars are back on the roads, and

people are returning to their daily commutes, the COVID-19 pandemic is transi-
tioning to the next phase, which is after lockdown or after recovery. In this phase,

 

Fig.21 Announcement drone [96]

g) Springer
Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research (2020) 4:325-364 353

 

Fig.22 All facilities at once, multipurpose drone [96]

everybody needs to know the importance of social distancing everywhere to mitigate
the spread of the virus. In response to this phase of COVID-19, autonomous robots
can be used to control social distancing. For instance, Spot [156], a four-legged robot
designed in Singapore to be similar to a dog, reminds people to practice social dis-
tancing in public places. While this robot can be controlled remotely, it is also capable
of transferring data to a web interface for further monitoring. [157]. Figure 23 is the
Spot robot for monitoring the practice of social distancing.

5.4 Smartphone Applications

The use of IoT in healthcare is now expanding, and the major benefits are cost-
effectiveness, efficient monitoring, appropriate treatment, fewer mistakes, and excep-
tional diagnoses [159, 160]. Some smartphone applications have been developed
specifically in response to the pandemic’s challenges associated with reopening,
which will be covered in this section.

5.4.1 Aarogya Setu

Aarogya Setu [147, 148] is a contact tracing application for people to use on their
smartphones to increase awareness of and fight against this virus. Aarogya Setu is
designed for better communication between health service providers and people. In
the application, the user will be asked if he or she has any symptoms of COVID-19
or has recently traveled internationally. Analyzing the input data from the users along
with their tracking information, Aarogya Setu is able to notify the user if he or she
has had contact with someone who is already or later becomes a confirmed case.

5.4.2 TraceTogether

Singapore launched an application called TraceTogether [71] to capture data using an
encrypted ID from people who were in close contact with each other. The captured
data will not be used until a close contact identification is established [149, 161].
This data includes the duration of the visit, and the social distance will be stored for
21 days for contact tracing purposes in the future.

5.4.3 Hamagen

This contact tracing application was developed in Israel. Hamagen uses GPS tech-
nology to find out if the user has been in close contact with a person who tested
positive for COVID-19. In this application, for the sake of privacy, personal data will
not leave the smartphone until the user agree [72].

5.4.4 Coalition

Coalition [73] uses IoT technology and the blockchain [162—165] platform to provide
a secure contact tracing approach. In this app, users are assigned with random IDs
so that with the detection of any new cases, the users who were in close contact with
those cases will be notified.

5.4.5 BeAware Bahrain

BeAware Bahrain is a contact tracing application implemented in Bahrain that alerts
people when they are approaching contaminated areas with a detected COVID-19
case or if they were in close contact with a confirmed case. Also, this application
monitors the location of self-isolated cases for 14 days and allows users to leave
quarantine areas for testing appointments, which means this app is also applicable
for the second phase of this pandemic [74, 150].

5.4.6 eRouska
This application monitors and captures any close proximity between its users. If

one of the users’ test is positive for COVID-19, eRouska will notify others regarding
probable infection so they can take action regarding their health situation [75].

5.4.7 Social Media—Whatsapp

As of April 2020, the world had about 3.8 billion users on social media [166]. This
number of users creates a great opportunity to implement telemedicine healthcare
support using social media applications during this pandemic. One of the most pop-
ular applications is Whatsapp. This application provides the chance for patients to
consult remotely with their physicians using virtual meetings, which will lead to
decreasing hospital visits by patients. Using this method is applicable to all phases
during the COVID-19 pandemic [167].

6 Discussion and Future Work

COVID-19 is considered both a global health crisis and an international economic
threat. The restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had
a devastating effect on many businesses, marketplaces, economics, society, and our
lives. The full health, social, and economic consequences of this pandemic and its
restrictions will take time to be fully recognized and quantified; however, there are
many ongoing efforts in the research and industrial communities to utilize different
technologies to detect, treat, and trace the virus to mitigate its impacts. Internet of
Things (IoT) technology has shown promising results in early detection, quarantine
time, and after recovery from COVID-19; however, as we learn more about the virus
and its behavior, we should adjust and improve our approaches in different phases.
For example, it would be interesting to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IoT
technology in order to use AI power to minimize interactions between healthcare
workers and patients in all phases. Another example is using touchless technology
with the help of other inputs (such as gesture and voice) that could efficiently lower
the spread of the disease and end the pandemic sooner [168]. Further research needs
to be done on convincing confirmed cases of COVID-19 to remain in quarantine to
mitigate the spread of the virus. Moreover, how can [oT devices help isolated patients
efficiently in their daily lives. After lockdown, as businesses and marketplaces are
opening gradually, how can IoT devices be incorporated in businesses to cover both
safety and efficiency. Answers to those questions will attract considerable attention
in both research and industrial disciplines and open new research avenues in this area.

One of the main concerns about using IoT devices in different phases of this
pandemic is the privacy issue when patients are asked to share their information.
Definitely, this is a big concern for every patient, so defining secure channels for
communications or utilizing different encryption techniques before sharing private
information would be possible research areas.

Having IoT-enabled Smart Cities can be extremely helpful in combating the cur-
rent and any future pandemic through collaboration between medical centers, cities,
etc. [169]. Along with aforementioned IoT applications, Allam et al. [170] emphasize
the importance of the concept of Smart City networks while the world is struggling
with the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart City infrastructure can help people maintain
social distancing by the implementation of smart transportation systems including
crowd monitoring, smart parking, and traffic re-routing [171]. As a part of smart

g) Springer
356 Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research (2020) 4:325-364

living in the Smart City, smart home [oT-based technologies can also reduce the
infection rate of COVID-19. For instance, smart home doorbells and security systems
can be implemented to prevent users from touching surfaces, so there will not be any
contamination of the virus from touching those surfaces [15, 172, 173].

7 Conclusion

While the world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, many technologies have
been implemented to fight against this disease. One of these technologies is the Inter-
net of Things (loT), which has been widely used in the healthcare industry. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, this technology has shown very encouraging results deal-
ing with this disease. For this paper, we conducted a survey on the recent proposed
IoT devices aiming to assist healthcare workers and authorities during the COVID-19
pandemic. We reviewed the [oT-related technologies and their implementations in
three phases, including “Early Diagnosis,” “Quarantine Time,” and “After Recovery.”
For each phase, we evaluated the role of IoT-enabled/linked technologies including
wearables, drones, robots, [oT buttons, and smartphone applications in combating
COVID-19. IoT technology can be extremely efficient for this pandemic, but it is also
critical to consider the privacy of data. By implementing IoT technology properly
in a secure way, more patients, with peace of mind, can participate in their treat-
ment using IoT devices. As a result, authorities and healthcare workers can better
respond to pandemics. Consequently, the impact of these types of diseases, including
infections, hospitalizations, and death rate, can be significantly reduced.
