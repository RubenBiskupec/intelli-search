Abstract

Topology and performance are the two main topics dealt in the development of robotic mechanisms. However, it is
still a challenge to connect them by integrating the modeling and design process of both parts in a unified frame.

As the properties associated with topology and performance, finite motion and instantaneous motion of the robot
play key roles in the procedure. On the purpose of providing a fundamental preparation for integrated modeling and
design, this paper carries out a review on the existing unified mathematic frameworks for motion description and
computation, involving matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, dual quaternion and pure dual quaternion, finite screw and
instantaneous screw. Besides the application in robotics, the review of the work from these mathematicians concen-
trates on the description, composition and intersection operations of the finite and instantaneous motions, especially
on the exponential-differential maps which connect the two sides. Furthermore, an in-depth discussion is worked out
by investigating the algebraical relationship among these methods and their further progress in integrated robotic
development. The presented review offers insightful investigation to the motion description and computation, and
therefore would help designers to choose appropriate mathematical tool in the integrated design and modeling and

design of mechanisms and robots.

Keywords: Robotic mechanism, Integrated method, Matrix Lie group, Dual quaternion, Finite screw

1 Introduction

Mechanism, serving as the execution unit, is one of the
essential subsystems of robot. The development of robot
meeting the requirements from application scenarios
depends largely on the analysis and design of robotic
mechanism, which focus on topology and performance
[1, 2]. Topology denotes the mechanical structure of the
robotic mechanism. Topology analysis and design, also
named as type synthesis, arrange the limbs and joints
according to the demands on mechanism mobility,
including number, sequence, type and axis (or direction)
[3, 4]. Performance describes the output motion or/and
force of the robotic mechanism. Performance analysis

studies the kinematic, stiffness or dynamic mappings
between joint space and operated space [5, 6], and per-
formance design searches for the optimal parameters to
guide the prototyping based on the task requirements [7,
8]. Conventionally, type synthesis, performance analy-
sis and design of robotic mechanism are carried out in
sequence [9]. This development procedure is to firstly
invent the topological structures, select one type, build
the performance models, and finally implement the opti-
mal design. In this process, however, the type synthesis
and performance design were separately implemented.
The disconnection between topology and performance
models leads to: (1) the difficulty in choosing particu-
lar topological structure as the performance features
are usually regarded as the selecting criteria, and (2) the
failure in concerning mechanism types in the optimal
design since different topological structures behave dif-
ferently. Therefore, it has long been a desire to unify the

topology and performance analysis and design of robotic
mechanisms.

Motion is the property considered in every stage of the
development procedure, which is divided into two cate-
gories: finite and instantaneous motions [10, 11]. When a
robotic mechanism moves along a continuous path, finite
motion describes the total movement of the mechanism
with respect to the initial pose [10], and instantaneous
motion evaluates the velocity (acceleration, jerk, etc.) of
the mechanism at current pose [11]. Literature review
shows that type synthesis starts from predefined mobil-
ity described either by motion pattern based on finite
motion computations [12, 13] or by constraint analysis
based on instantaneous motion properties. Kinematic,
stiffness and dynamic performance of the robotic mecha-
nism relates directly to the displacement, velocity and
acceleration mappings, which are analyzed either at
finite motion or instantaneous motion level. It indicates
that the finite and instantaneous motion description and
computation are the fundamental preparation for the
development of robotic mechanism. Hence, a unified
mathematical framework for the finite and instantaneous
motions is essential for the integrated topology and per-
formance analysis and design.

The unified mathematical framework involves the ana-
lytical description, algebraic computation and mapping
relations of the finite and instantaneous motions. The
computations include mainly composition and _ inter-
section of motions. Composition is the operation for
the accumulation of motions that can be the successive
motions of a rigid body or the resulted motion by several
rigid bodies connected by joints. For instance, the finite/
instantaneous motion of a serial mechanism is calculated
by the composition of finite/instantaneous motions of
joints [14]. Intersection is to obtain the common part of
different motions. Such operation is applied in the occa-
sion like the finite motion of parallel mechanism whose
calculation is performed by the intersection of finite
motions of limbs [15]. Specially, the mapping relation of
the finite and instantaneous motions is of vital impor-
tance because it is the main reason for the disconnection
between topology synthesis and performance analysis
of robotic mechanisms. So far, there are three mathe-
matical tools that have been applied to the descriptions,
computations and mappings of finite and instantaneous
motions, i.e. matrix Lie group and Lie algebra [16], dual
quaternion and pure dual quaternion [17], finite screw
and instantaneous screw [18].

In the matrix Lie group, a special Euclidean group
consisting of a rotation matrix and a translation vec-
tor is denoted by SE(3), whose element is rewritten
into a homogenous matrix. The linear transformation

Page 2 of 15

can be implemented in a homogenous form, resulting
in describing any finite motion by an element of the
matrix representation of SE(3) [16]. By exploring the
computation rules, matrix Lie group was introduced
to the mobility analysis [19-21] and type synthesis of
mechanism [22-27]. The matrix form of Lie algebra
se(3) was employed to describe instantaneous motion
of mechanisms. There exists an exponential map
between matrix representations of SE(3) and se(3) [28].

Dual quaternion is the extension of quaternion from
real number to dual number. The composition and
intersection operations are investigated, allowing the
dual quaternion being used in displacement mod-
eling of mechanism [29]. Pure dual quaternion, the
dual vector, describes instantaneous motion, which
was adopted to the kinematics [30] and dynamics [31].
There is an exponential map between the dual quater-
nion and pure dual quaternion [32].

Finite screw is proposed to describe the finite motion
of rigid body in the framework of screw theory [33].
A screw triangle product [34] was defined to accom-
plish the composition, and the algebraic method [35]
to perform the intersection of finite motions was inves-
tigated, which are employed in the type synthesis of
mechanism [36]. Instantaneous screw was described
as the twist of rigid body in the beginning [34]. Twist
and wrench, known as the infinitesimal displacement
and external force, are widely applied to the kinematic
[37, 38], stiffness [39, 40], dynamic analysis and design
[41-43] of mechanisms. It has been rigorously proved
that a differential map exists in the finite and instanta-
neous screws.

Although these three mathematical tools have been
applied at different stages of mechanism development,
their capabilities in unifying the topology and per-
formance analysis and design have not been realized.
Aiming at helping designers find out effective meth-
ods in implementing integrated analysis and design so
as to meet different requirements, this paper provides
a comprehensive review on the mathematical tools for
this topic. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, motions in integrated topology and _ perfor-
mance modeling and design is discussed. Section 3 to
5 introduce the matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, dual
quaternion and pure dual quaternion, finite screw and
instantaneous screw, respectively, including history of
development, description, computations and mapping
relations of finite and instantaneous motions. A com-
parison of the three mathematic frameworks is illus-
trated from the view of algebraic structures in Section 6
following with the applications of unified mathematic
tools in integrated topology and performance modeling
and design. The conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

2 Relationship between Development of Robotic

Mechanism and Motions
It is a long-term challenge to unify the topology and per-
formance modeling and design in the development of
robotic mechanism. To address this problem, an inte-
grated mathematical framework should be prepared, for
which the relationship between topology/performance
and motions is firstly analyzed.

Topology, considered as the skeleton of a robot,
includes the numbers and types of kinematic limbs as well
as the adjacency and incidence among kinematic joints
[44]. One particular topology corresponds to a motion
pattern of the robot. Hence, type synthesis is to obtain all
the possible topologies according to the expected motion
pattern. The description of expected motion patterns
can be classified into two formats [45, 46]. One takes the
finite motion form, which expresses the displacement of
the robot from the initial pose to another. Referred to
the summary of the generalized procedure of type syn-
thesis by Gao [47], the available limbs are generated by
the composition and intersection operations of finite
motions. The other methods begin with the instantane-
ous motion description. Instantaneous motion is the
infinitesimal motion of the robot at the given moment.
Composition operation of instantaneous motions is the
basis to get the available limbs and assembly conditions
in the type synthesis of robotic mechanisms. Therefore,
the topology model is related with the description and
calculation of finite or instantaneous motion.

Performance determines the behavior of robots in
practical application. Denoted by finite and instantane-
ous motions, the performances of a robot can be cat-
egorized by displacement, velocity and acceleration.
The displacement model of the robotic mechanism
is sometimes interpreted as forward or inverse kin-
ematics, which focuses on the mapping between the
displacements of actuations and the pose of the end-
effector [48]. The displacement model is constructed
and calculated by the finite motions. For example, the
displacement model of a serial mechanism is built by
the composition of finite motions of each kinematic
joint. In the case of parallel mechanisms, both compo-
sition and intersection operations of the finite motions
are involved. With the displacement model, the reach-
able workspace of the robot can also be analyzed. The
next level of performance, i.e., the velocity of robotic
mechanism, is described and calculated by instantane-
ous motion, because both instantaneous motion and
velocity denote the infinitesimal motion at given pose.
The velocity and force mapping between joint space
and operated space lay the foundation of the kinematic
performance analysis of serial and parallel mecha-
nisms, which are carried out by the composition and

Page 3 of 15

intersection of instantaneous motions of joints and
limbs. Regarding the static deformation as the pertur-
bation of displacement, stiffness can be classified as the
performance at velocity level. The stiffness modeling
and analysis also rely on the composition and intersec-
tion of instantaneous motions. Finally, the performance
at acceleration level refers to the dynamics, in which
the velocity, acceleration and forces of the robotic
mechanisms are involved. Since acceleration model is
obtained by the first-order of velocity model, the per-
formance at acceleration level are analyzed by instanta-
neous motions. In summary, the performance model is
formulated by the description and calculation of finite
or instantaneous motion.

From the above analysis, it is concluded that the
topology and performance of robotic mechanisms
are completely reflected by finite and instantaneous
motions. Therefore, the kernel of the integrated mod-
eling lies in the algebraic derivation between finite and
instantaneous motions. Because of intrinsic connec-
tions between displacement and velocity, finite and
instantaneous motions could be connected by differen-
tial and integral mappings. In this manner, if the finite
motion of a continuous path is known, the instantane-
ous motion at the given pose could be derived, and vice
versa. The composition and intersection operations of
the resultant finite and instantaneous motions can also
be connected, which is beneficial for implementing the
integrated topology and performance modeling and
design of robotic mechanism. However, these mappings
cannot be performed when topology and performance
models are established by different mathematical tools.
Consequently, a unified mathematic framework for
finite and instantaneous motions is essential for the
integrated modeling.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the description, computa-
tion and mapping of finite and instantaneous motions
involving in integrated modeling should be covered in a
unified mathematic framework. Till now, there are three
mathematical tools that have been applied, including
matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, dual quaternion and
pure dual quaternion, finite screw and instantaneous
screw. To provide an algebraic foundation of integrated

modeling and design, these unified mathematic tools
are reviewed in terms of the topics in the following sec-
tions, respectively.

3 Matrix Lie Group and Lie Algebra Based Method
Among the three methods applied in topology and per-
formance integrated modeling and design of robotic
mechanisms, i.e., matrix Lie group and Lie algebra based
method, dual quaternion and pure dual quaternion based
method, finite screw and instantaneous screw based
method, the matrix based method is introduced in this
section. At first, the developments on the applications of
matrix Lie group and Lie algebra in robotic mechanisms
are reviewed in detail, which is followed by the introduc-
tions on their expressions and computations. Based upon
these, the exponential and differential mappings between
them are illustrated.

3.1 Matrix Lie Group and Lie Algebra

When rotation and translation are respectively described
by linear transformation and translation vector, each
6-dimensional finite motion in 3-dimensional space is
thus represented as a pair of 3-dimensional orthogo-
nal matrix and vector. In this way, the entire set of finite
motions forms a Lie group under motion composition,
which is called the special Euclidean group (SE(3)). Cor-
respondingly, when 3-dimensional skew-symmetric
matrix and vector are used to respectively describe angu-
lar and linear velocities, the entire set of 6-dimensional
instantaneous motions constituted by the pairs of veloci-
ties form the Lie algebra se(3) of SE(3).

The matrix Lie group and Lie algebra are originated
from the Erlangen program proposed by Klein [16] in
the late 19th century, from then, the pairs in SE(3) and
se(3) are rewritten into homogenous matrices. Both finite
motion and instantaneous motion can be expressed in
homogenous forms, resulting in that any finite motion is
described by an element in the matrix representation of
SE(3), and that any instantaneous motion is described by
an element in the matrix representation of se(3).

It was Hervé [19] who introduced the matrix Lie group
into mobility analysis of mechanisms. In the 1980s and
1990s, he had been investigating description and calcu-
lation of mechanism displacement by the sub-groups of
SE(3) [20, 49, 50]. The application of matrix Lie group in
geometry and kinematics of mechanisms was discussed.
On this basis, Hervé and Sparacino [51] employed matrix
Lie group to the type synthesis (structure synthesis) of
parallel mechanisms. This work was later developed by Li
and Hervé [7, 8, 10, 26, 52], Lee and Hervé [53-56]. Owing
to their efforts, a systematic type synthesis method by
matrix Lie group was proposed. Specially, Li introduced
the sub-manifolds of SE(3) as the extension of sub-groups

Page 4 of 15

to describe the displacements of parallel mechanisms
and their limbs. Many novel parallel mechanisms were
invented, including five degree-of-freedom (DoF) parallel
mechanisms that could not be synthesized due to the lack
of 5-dimensional sub-groups of SE(3). Besides applying
matrix Lie group to type synthesis, Fanghella and Galletti
[57, 58] discussed the approximate computation algorithms
of matrix Lie group. Composition of two sub-groups was
computed by their minimum envelope group, while the
intersection of two sub-groups was performed by search-
ing for the maximum common group. All possible cases of
sub-group composition and intersection were listed. This
computation method is different from the analytical algo-
rithms in Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula [59, 60] and
is easier to be directly applied. Meng [61] also engaged in
giving the clear intersection algorithms of sub-groups. They
obtained the intersection of Lie sub-groups by solving the
intersection of the corresponding Lie sub-algebras. In their
work, the matrix form of Lie algebra se(3) was employed to
describe instantaneous motion of mechanisms. The similar
method was employed by Wu [62-64] in type synthesis of
quotient mechanisms, and by Liu [65] in type synthesis of
mechanisms with adjoint-invariant sub-manifolds of SE
(3). All these contributions lead to the topology modeling
by using matrix Lie group and its sub-sets. In 1983, Brock-
ett [28, 66] established the framework of matrix Lie group
and Lie algebra for mechanism modeling and analysis. By
investigating the exponential mapping between matrix rep-
resentations of SE(3) and se(3), he set up the connection
between finite and instantaneous motions of mechanisms.
His work was further extended by Li [67-69], Park [70-72],
Chen [73-75], Chen [76—78] and their colleagues, leading
to an integrated framework for kinematics, dynamics, cali-
bration, and control of mechanisms.

3.2 Matrix Lie Group and Its Computations

As introduced in Section 2.1, the matrix representation
of SE(3) is the entire set of homogeneous matrices that
describe all the linear transformations in the Euclidean
space. This matrix Lie group can be used to describe all the
finite motions of a rigid body or a mechanism. Hence, the
finite motion description based upon matrix Lie group can
be expressed as,

SE(3) = {ele= Ss {| ReS0G) cer’|, (1)

where SO(3) denotes the special orthogonal group con-
sisting of the orthogonal matrices that describe rotations,
IR? denotes the 3-dimensional vector space, R is an arbi-
trary element in SO(3) which represents the rotation
matrix about the Chasles’ axis, ¢ is the translation vector
along that axis. R and ¢ involve the Chasles’ axis
Huo et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:62

T
(s? (rf x sp)’ ) together with the corresponding rota-

tional angle @ and translational distance t. The expres-
sions of R and £ can be referred to Ref. [28], as

R= E3 +sin6s¢ + (1 — cos@) (5), (2)

t = (£3 — R) (1 — s}r/57) + tse, (3)

where E3 is a three-order unit matrix, s¢ is the skew-
symmetric matrix that denotes the cross product of sr. r¢
expresses the position vector of the Chasles’ axis.

When the matrix Lie group theory is applied in topol-
ogy modeling and analysis of robotic mechanisms, the
finite motion generated by each 1-DoF joint can be
described by a 1-dimensional sub-group of SE(3). Fol-
lowing this manner, the motion of each limb is the
composition of all its joints’ motions, and the mecha-
nism motion is the intersection of the limbs’ motions.

The composition of matrix Lie sub-groups is per-
formed by matrix multiplication. This is because any
Lie sub-group can be regarded as the composition of
several 1-dimensional sub-groups. Hence, the composi-
tion of finite motions can be expressed by the multipli-
cation of a sequence of 1-DoF finite motions as,

M =M,,---M2M,, (4)
where M,; (k = 1,2,..., m) denotes the 1-dimensional
sub-group that describes the kth finite motion in the
sequence.

Consider that the elements in each 1-dimensional
sub-group can be expressed by exponential expres-
sions, M; can be obtained as

M,= { esr

 

On € R}, (5)

where é ‘fk is the homogenous matrix that represents the
Chasles’ axis that corresponds to M; and a pitch, as
~ tk
~ _ Stk Vk X Sfjk + 0, Sok 6
Shik | 6 0 . (6)

The denotations of the symbols in Eq. (6) can be
referred to those in Eqs. (2) and (3).

Taking the exponential form, Eq. (4) can be rewritten
as,

M = { ebbun .. -ch8i2e%Fi1]6),6),...46, RB. (7)

In order to obtain the expansion form of Eq. (7), the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula is employed. The
composition of two 1-DoF finite motions could be per-
formed as,

Herein, i118 kr n& fk = OOx41 (é rei’ hk a é eke f+) is
defined as the Lie bracket. It is found that algebraic compu-
tation becomes more complicated and difficult because of
higher order items, especially for the cases of more than two
motions.

Intersection of finite motions is the maximum common
sub-group or sub-manifold contained in all motions. By
using the property of the exponential expression in Eq. (5),
Meng [20] partly solved this problem by mapping the inter-
section of the Lie sub-groups to Lie algebra level. Till now,
intersection of finite motions by matrix Lie sub-groups and
the composited manifolds (the product of several Lie sub-
groups) is mainly based upon specific principles, such as
the cases given by Fanghella and Galletti [16, 17]. However,
these operations are difficult to implement in an analytical
manner and be applied for all the motion patterns. There
is no generic intersection algorithm for matrix Lie sub-
groups and the composited manifolds yet.

3.3 Matrix Lie Algebra and Its Computations

As the counterpart of matrix Lie group SE(3), its matrix
Lie algebra se(3) is employed to describe the instantaneous
motions of robotic mechanisms, as

se(3) = {of lof, = (9 9) overt, (9)

where @ and v are angular and linear velocities in
3-dimensional vector forms.
Any element in se(3) can be rewritten into vector form as

(@ v)' = a6, (10)

E,=(s: rex s:t+prs:)', (11)

where &, is the normalized unit velocity, w is its ampli-
tude, and p, denotes the pitch. r; expresses the position of
the Mozzi’s axis.

When the matrix Lie algebra theory is applied in per-
formance modeling and analysis of robotic mechanisms,
1-dimensional sub-space of se(3) is employed to describe
the instantaneous motion generated by 1-DoF joint. In
this way, the composition of the motions of all joints in a
Huo et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:62

limb leads to the limb motion, and the intersection of all
the limbs’ motions results in the mechanism motion.

As is well known, se(3) is a 6-dimensional vector space.
The composition of matrix Lie sub-spaces is performed
by linear addition as,

T =span{T; UT, U---UTy,}

12
~T1 610: OT», (12)

where ‘@’ denotes the combination operation of linear
vector spaces. The intersection of several sub-spaces can
be obtained through linear computations, as

T=T|NT)::-NT,

1 13
=(T7 @Ty---@T;) ;

where T;, T), .... T,, denote 1 sub-spaces of se(3). The
computations shown in Eqs. (12) and (13) are easy to
be conducted because they both fall in the area of linear
algebra.

3.4 Mappings between Matrix Lie Group and Lie Algebra

According to the physical principle, finite motion (dis-
placement) is the integral of instantaneous motion
(velocity), and velocity is the differential of displacement.
When the displacement and velocity are described by
matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, a differential-exponen-
tial mapping can be formulated between them as follows,

dg = de®’
= 68 pe") (14)
= wk es,

ok: = g, (15)

The interpretations on the above two equations are
given as follows:

(1) The differential of g at 6 = 0 is wé 'f- As the Chasles’
axis is coincident with the axis of the velocity when
0 = 0, the differential of g at 6 = 0 is an element of
se(3). This is because se(3) is the tangent space of
SE(3) at the identity element (the unit matrix).

(2) The exponential of wé ; with respect to the time
results in g, which means that the exponential of
any elements in se(3) with respect to the time leads
to the elements in SE(3).

The differential-exponential mapping between matrix
Lie group SE(3) and Lie algebra se(3) leads to the follow-
ing 1-DoF case, as

4 Dual Quaternion and Pure Dual Quaternion
Based Method

The review of dual quaternion and pure dual quaternion
based method is provided in this section. Firstly, the
application of this method in topology and performance
modeling and design of robotic mechanisms is traced.
Secondly, the basic formats together with their compo-
sition and intersection operations are discussed. Finally,
the exponential/Cayley- differential maps between finite
and instantaneous motions are constructed in the form
of quaternionic algebras.

4.1 Dual Quaternion and Pure Dual Quaternion
As the representations of SE(3) and se(3), respectively,
dual quaternion and pure dual quaternion are applied to
describe the transformation from one pose to another
and the velocity at any instant. Dual quaternion utilizes
eight parameters by presenting a scalar with the cosine
of half the dual angle [17] and further six numbers by
integrating the direction and position of the motion axis
with the sine of half the dual angel. Herein, dual angle
integrated the rotational angle and linear displacement
by dual operator. Pure dual quaternion is also called dual
vector, which includes six elements and is defined by
means of the unit axis and amplitude of instantaneous
motion.

The dual quaternion and pure dual quaternion based
method can be traced back to Euler-Rodrigues’ param-
eters and Euler-Rodrigues’ formula [79] in the 18th
Huo et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:62

century. Hamilton [80] and Rodrigues [81] did some
pioneering work in this field. Based on that, Clifford [82]
transformed rotation about an axis into translation paral-
lel to the axis and proposed the concept of “biquaternion”
in the investigation of geometry and algebra. Biquater-
nion was then applied to motion description and termed
as dual quaternion [17].

It was pointed out the dual quaternion is the extension
of quaternion from real number to dual number. Accord-
ing to the “transference principle” [83, 84], the algorithms
for quaternions can be applied to the algorithms for dual
quaternions. In this way, the composition of two dual qua-
ternions could be computed by quaternion multiplication
[85], i.e., Euler-Rodrigues’ formula with dual angles. As for
the intersection algorithms, Sun [86] employed analytical
derivations to deal with the intersection of the sets of dual
quaternions. Mechanism analysis by dual quaternion was
implemented by McAulay [87] for the first time who uti-
lized dual quaternion to describe rigid body displacement.
Later on, dual quaternion was used in the kinematics of
mechanisms from a geometrical prospective by Refs. [88,
89] and Blaschke [90]. Kong studied the method for motion
mode analysis of single-loop and closed-loop spatial mech-
anisms by formulating a set of kinematic loop equations
based on dual quaternions [91, 92]. It was proved in ref.
[93] that dual quaternions facilitate to avoid singularities
in the analysis of finite motion. Besides robotic kinemat-
ics, joint stiffness identification and deformation compen-
sation algorithms for serial robots were constructed [94].
Apart from the applications of dual quaternion in finite
motion description, pure dual quaternion (dual vector) was
adopted to describe instantaneous motion. For instance,
Yang and Freudenstein [29, 95] combined both dual qua-
ternion and pure dual quaternion to analyze the displace-
ment and velocity of a spatial four-link mechanism. Similar
researches on the mechanism kinematic analysis by dual
quaternions can be found in [30, 96, 97]. For the mecha-
nism design, McCarthy et al. [98, 99] formulated forward
and inverse kinematic equations of spatial serial chains
and proposed a semi-analytical design method. These
kinematic equations are obtained by the exponential map
between pure dual quaternion and dual quaternion. Selig
[32] built the dynamic model of mechanisms using qua-
ternions [31]. In his research, the Cayley map in dual
quaternion theory was constructed concerning that the
entire set of dual quaternions is a double cover of SE(3).
The intrinsic connections between quaternion exponen-
tial map and Euler-Rodrigues’ formula were deeply inves-
tigated by Dai [100], relating dual quaternions with other
representations of SE(3). Taking advantages of these map-
pings, the integrated method was also used in calibration
algorithms [101, 102], path planning and control strategies
[103, 104]. Motivated by the arithmetic operations of dual

quaternions, Cohen developed the concept of hyper dual
quaternion currently, which was applied for the displace-
ment and velocity modeling of serial mechanisms [105].

4.2 Dual quaternion and its computations

The dual quaternion is the extension of quaternion from
real number to dual number. Rotation axis and rotational
angle in quaternion can be replaced with dual axis and dual
angle. Thus, the 1-DoF finite motion is described by dual
quaternion as

aN aN

0 0
D= — in—L?, 20
cos 5 + sins ‘f ( )

where 6 = 6 + et denotes the dual angle. It has the cosine
and sine functions as

—=cos——-—sin—é, sin~ =sin—+—cos—é,
2 2 2 2 2 2

6 6 t.@ 6 6 t 6

where ¢ is the dual unit and e? = 0. ()’ in this paper
denotes a vector in pure dual quaternion form. Le is the
pure dual quaternion form of the Pliicker coordinates of
the Chasles’ axis, which can be denoted as
A __ oA A A + oA A te Te
L, = Sp + EN X Se. Herein, Sr and r, are the unit direc
tion dual vector and position dual vector of the Chasles’
axis.

sf = sprit sfof + Sak,

re = rpabt rp af t+ rpak,

where s¢,, and ry, (4=1,2,3) are scalar coefficients
of Pliicker coordinates. i, j, k are plural units with the
properties,

P=pP=k=-1, ij=k, ijk = -1. (21)

For a serial mechanism or limbs in parallel mechanism,
the finite motion generated by all 1-DoF joints can be
solved by the composition operation, which can be rewrit-
ten utilizing quaternion multiplication [80, 81],

It is noted that the motion of moving platform in a par-
allel mechanism and that generated by each limb is in

equilibrium. Therefore, having the analytical resultant
motion of limbs at hand, the finite motion of the moving
platform can be obtained by the intersection operation
as,

-=Dy, i=1,2,...,m.
(24)

Thanks to the expression and quaternion multiplica-
tion defined in Eqs. (20), (21), the finite motion of each
limb could be determined by formulating equations as

Eq. (24).

4.3 Pure Dual Quaternion and Its Computations

The velocity of the rigid body at any instant is specified
by a dual vector, which connects two 3-D vectors by dual
operator. In this way, the format of pure dual quaternion
is introduced here

d = wL; + ewps,, (25)

where Li = s/\ + er} xs is the pure dual quaternion
form of the Pliicker coordinates of the Mozzi’s axis.
Herein, s/, r;\ are the unit direction dual vector and posi-
tion dual vector of the Mozzi’s axis.

\ 2 J
S, = S18 + Sta + 543k,

N\ 2 J
r, =Wreib + ref + 123k,

where s;,, and rz, (vu = 1,2,3) are scalar coefficients of
Pliicker coordinates.

The pure dual quaternions are Lie algebra elements
with both well-defined addition and multiplication. Thus,
when pure dual quaternion is applied in the performance
modeling and design of robotic mechanisms, the com-
position and intersection operations can be performed
as linear algebra, referring to Eq. (12) and Eq. (13),
respectively.

4.4 Mappings between Dual Quaternion and Pure Dual
Quaternion

Similar to matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, the exponen-

tial map and Cayley map exist from pure dual quaternion

to dual quaternion, which are given by,

» A 2 A 4 A3 5

(27)
In the modeling process of robots, exponential map
facilitates to connect the velocity and the possible dis-
placements allowed by the joint. It would be convenient
to formulate the topology or kinematic models of serial
mechanisms or open-loop limbs by taking the axes and
motion variables of joints in an analytical manner. Cayley
map is always used in numerical methods since it does
not need so many trigonometric function calls and will
avoid cost consuming. For multi-DofF, the maps could be
expanded as

6,L’ OL, OL’

0) ,02;°-- ,0,€IR

 

(28)

Cayp (z;,,) ---Cayp (z/:) = D,,-+- Dy. (29)

When the topology/displacement models are obtained
at first, differential mapping between dual quaternion
and pure dual quaternion would help to get the velocities.
It could be executed by taking differentiations of dual
quaternion D with respect to time.

It indicates that the time derivative of D at the initial

5 Finite Screw and Instantaneous Screw Based
Method

In this section, integrated screw theory based method

is presented beginning with the progress achieved in

topology and performance modeling and design of

robotic mechanisms. Then the description and compu-

tation of motions by finite and instantaneous screws are
Huo et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:62

introduced. After that, the differential mapping between
them is formulated.

5.1 Finite Srew and Instantaneous Screw

According to Chasles’s theorem [10], a general rigid-
body displacement could be described as a rotation about
a line followed by a translation in the same direction as
the rotation axis. Such a line is specified by the finite
motion axis, a rotation angle, and a pitch. Motivated by
this point, finite screw is invented to describe the finite
motion in a 6-D quasi-vector format. Meanwhile, instan-
taneous motion could be expressed by the line in linear
subspace, representing instantaneous motion axis with
angular and linear velocities. Instantaneous screw was
proposed based on spatial vectors with the definition of
pitch. By this means, finite and instantaneous motions
are depicted in the view of geometry by finite and instan-
taneous screws.

The finite screw and instantaneous screw based method
origins from screw theory proposed in the 19th century.
In the beginning, Chasles [10] proposed the concept of
twist motion of a rigid body. It was further developed
by Poinsot and Pliicker [11], in which screw coordinates
of infinitesimal displacement and external force were
involved. They were named as twist and wrench, respec-
tively. The reciprocal property of twist and wrench was
later explored by Ball [106] and Klein [107, 108].

In the book “A treatise on the theory of screws” [109],
Ball discussed kinematics and dynamics of an arbitrary
rigid body by screw theory. It laid a solid foundation for
the mechanism analysis by Hunt [110] who proposed the
screw based kinematic and dynamic modeling method
for serial, parallel and closed-loop mechanisms. Following
Hunt’s work, substantial researches were carried out for
the mechanism analysis and design based on instantaneous
screw, such as type synthesis [3, 45, 111], statics and kinet-
ics [112, 113], performance evaluation and optimization
[114, 115]. Besides the applications of instantaneous screw,
finite screw, termed by Dimentberg [116], was proposed to
describe the finite motion of rigid body. On this track, the
format of finite screw, including the pitch and amplitude,
was intensively studied by Parkin [117, 118], Hunt [119],
Dai [33] and Huang [120-122]. Other than description of
finite screw, the computation was another difficult prob-
lem. To this end, Roth [123] defined screw triangle prod-
uct to accomplish finite screw composition with the aid of
Euler-Rodrigues’ formula. This definition had been widely
accepted. From then on, many scholars focused on find-
ing out concise algorithm for the screw triangle product
[124—129]. Through the linear combination of two original
screws, their translational parts and the screw along their
common perpendicular, Huang [130] simplified the screw
triangle product. However, the nonlinear intersection

Page 9 of 15

of finite screws was analyzed in linear subspaces [131],
which leads to inappropriate results. In terms of the finite
screw intersection, Sun [18, 35, 36] presented an algebraic
method. For the first time, Dai [34] formulated the map-
ping between finite and instantaneous screws, and defined
correlations among screw theory, matrix Lie group and
quaternions [132]. Based on the contribution of Dai, Sun
[18, 133] expanded the differential mapping to the analy-
sis of spatial mechanisms. For the applications of finite
screw to mechanism analysis, Huang [120-122] built the
forward kinematic equations of some serial mechanisms.
Sun and his colleagues [133-136] proposed a generic
method to formulate motion equations for different types
of mechanisms. Finite motion based type synthesis and
instantaneous motion based kinematic analysis of parallel
mechanisms are integrated by a consistent algebraic man-
ner in their method.

5.2 Finite Screw and Its Computations

Finite motion description by screw directly reflect the
Chasles’ axis together with the angular and linear displace-
ments. The 1-DoF finite motion could be parameterized as
finite screw in 6-dimensional quasi-vector form as

_ 0 Sf 0
s=2tn5(,, ts) +(s))

where sy, r¢, 0, f have the same meanings as given in Eqs.
(2), (3).

Composition operation of finite screws could be per-
formed by screw triangle product signed as “A”. The com-
position of two 1-dimensional finite screws results in a
linear combination of the two original screws, their trans-
lational parts and the screw along their common per-
pendicular. In this way, the analytical expression of the
composited motion can be easily obtained in an approxi-
mately linear manner, which simplifies the nonlinear com-
position of finite motions

Similar to the intersection algorithm of dual qua-
ternions, the intersection of finite screws is achieved
through formulating the simultaneous equations
and solving the common range of the finite screw
expressions

5.4 Mappings between Finite and Instantaneous Screws
As far as we know, the exponential map does not exist
between instantaneous screw and finite screw. That is
because finite screw describes the displacement in a Gib-
son form, which break the linear transformation format
of finite motion description of matrix Li Group and dual
quaternion.

In spite of the lack of exponential map, differential map
between displacement and velocity can be performed
directly by taking differentiations of finite screw S- with
respect to time. For 1-DoF or multi-DoF finite screw S;,
the corresponding instantaneous screw system would be
formulated as

ry X St + pSt (35)

S; = of )
where S;, r;, @ and p have the same meanings as given in
Eq. (11).

For robotic mechanism, the velocity of moving plat-
form relative to the fixed platform forms a screw sys-
tem, which is composed by a set of 1-DoF screws. In the
process of performance modeling and design of robots,
screw system plays an important role in mobility analysis
and Jacobian formulation. For serial mechanisms, screw
system could be measured as the combination of the
instantaneous screws producing by each kinematic joint.
When mechanisms with parallel structures, intersection
operation of the screw systems generated by a series of
connected chains is carried out. Due to the work of Rico
and Duffy [137-139], screw systems were classified and
proved to be subspaces, sometimes even sub-algebras
of the Lie algebra se(3) of the Euclidean group SE (3).
Therefore, the combination and intersection operation
could be written as the form in Eq. (12) and Eq. (13),
respectively.

6 Discussions

After respectively reviewing the three mathematical tools
applied in topology and performance modeling and anal-
ysis of robotic mechanisms, further discussions on com-
parisons among them and their applications will be given
in this section.

6.1 Comparisons among the Three Methods

Based upon Sections 3-5, it can be seen that the instan-
taneous screws, matrix Lie algebra, and pure dual quater-
nions for instantaneous motion description are all linear
vector spaces, and their algebraic structures are isomor-
phic to each other. Thus, only the mathematical tools for
finite motion description will be compared here. The dif-
ferences among matrix Lie group, dual quaternions, and
finite screws rise from their different algebraic structures.
In order to discuss the differences of these three math-
ematical tools in describing rigid body finite motion, we
firstly look into their algebraic structures and the rela-
tionships among them and SE(3).

Any transformation matrix in the matrix Lie group can
be represented by a 4 x 4 real matrix, a 6 x 6 real matrix,
or a3 x3 dual matrix etc. Because these three represen-
tations are isomorphic with each other, we take 4x4
Huo et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:62

real matrix representation as an example in Section 3.
The entire set of each kind of these matrices has the
same inner closure and associative properties with SE(3).
Hence, the matrix Lie group forms a homomorphism of
SE(3). Furthermore, it is an isomorphism of SE(3), since
there exists a bijective mapping between them. The
matrix Lie group is also a representation of SE(3). This is
because the matrix operations play as linear transforma-
tions acting on the 6-dimensional vector space. Dual qua-
ternions have similar features. Half part of the entire set
of dual quaternions with positive rotational angles is also
an isomorphism and a representation of SE(3). Thus, the
entire set of dual quaternion is a double cover of SE(3).
The transformation matrices in matrix Lie group can be
composited by multiplication with linear transformation
formats. The same operation can be performed by dual
quaternions.

Different from transformation matrix and dual quater-
nion, finite screw is invented to break the linear transfor-
mation format of finite motion description, which can be
regarded as a general form of Gibbs vector. Finite screw
does not act on any vector space, and cannot transform
any coordinate of geometric point or line. It is a math-
ematical tool purely for finite motion description, and
it can express the basic elements of Chasles’ motion in
a straightforward manner. The composition algorithm
of finite screws, i.e., screw triangle product, maintains
the screw format, which directly leads to the expres-
sions of basic elements of the resultant Chasles’ motion.
Although the entire set of finite screws under screw tri-
angle product has the same inner closure and associative
properties with SE(3), it is not a representation of SE(3).
In other words, it only forms a isomorphism of SE(3).

Any element of SE(3) is a combination of rotation
matrix and translation vector. It is a homogeneous trans-
formation of the coordinates of points. In this way, all
representations of SE(3) cannot break the inherent linear
transformation formats. Hence, only finite screw with
screw triangle product can express and composite finite
motions in a non-redundant and direct manner.

All the three methods reviewed in Sections 3—5 could
be used to describe and compute all situations of finite
motions. To further investigate the relationships among
them, we rewrite the element in dual quaternion in the
following way,

6 t . 0
D= | cos — — €=sin—
2 2 2

6 6 t 0
+ sin Sf + € sins (ry x sf) + 9 COs 9 f .
(38)

Compare the above equation and Eq. (1)—(3) with finite
screw in Eq. (32). It is noted that the information of a

Page 11 of 15

finite motion, i.e., the Chasles’ axis and the correspond-
ing rotational angle and translational distance, is involved
in the 3 x 3 rotation matrix and 3 x 1 translation vector
in, and is not easy to be extracted. Hence, for elements in
matrix Lie group, at least 12 items are needed to describe
the 6-dimensional finite motion. For dual quaternion,
8 items are needed, and the dual vector in D covers all
the finite motion characteristics while the dual scalar is
redundant. Finite screw contains the whole finite motion
characteristics in the 6-dimensional quasi-vector form.
Thus, it is non-redundant. Motion descriptions by finite
screw are more concise. On this basis, the composition
of two finite motions could be obtained by three cross
product computations and their linear combination. The
redundancy of matrix Lie group and dual quaternions
results in more operations in the process of computing
the composition and intersection of finite motions. In
the whole, finite and instantaneous screw based method
has the most concise formats to describe mechanism
motions, and provides the most explicit algorithms for
the computation.

6.2 Future Works on Applications of the Three Methods

From the discussion in previous sections, three uni-
fied mathematical tools are proved to have the abili-
ties of description, computation and mapping of finite
and instantaneous motions. With the aid of the unified
mathematical frameworks, the integrated topology and
performance modeling and design can be studied, which
is meaningful but still rarely investigated in the current
researches. Therefore, the next problem is how to apply
the above mathematical tools to the integrated modeling
and design. Since both the topology and performances
are considered, the integrated modeling and design pro-
cess can be interpreted as (1) finding out all possible
topologies having the same desired mobility, (2) formu-
lating the performances of every topological structure,
and (3) searching for the optimal topology and perfor-
mances. Having the above unified mathematical tools,
type synthesis and performance modeling can be carried
out in the same mathematical framework, as shown in

Figure 2. For instance, type synthesis can be implemented
by the finite motion based methods. By the mapping
between finite and instantaneous motions, the perfor-
mance model would be done by instantaneous motion
based methods. Hence, both the topological and perfor-
mance parameters can be defined in the optimal design.

The detail integrated modeling and design process
might be conducted as follows. First of all, the expected
motion is described in a finite motion format based on
matrix Lie group, dual quaternion or finite screw. By
taking the advantages of intersection and composition
operations, the available limbs and mechanisms would
be generated. More details are referred to [35, 51, 86].
Because the type synthesis is implemented in an alge-
braic manner, the parameterized topology models are
obtained. Then, the finite motion based topology model
is directly applied as the displacement model relative to
the initial pose. In order to construct the performance
models with topology parameters, the differential map-
ping between matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, dual
quaternion and pure dual quaternion, finite screw and
instantaneous screw are utilized. In this way, the veloc-
ity model of 1-DoF kinematic joint, multi-DoF limbs
and end-effector could be obtained in the forms of Lie
algebra, pure dual quaternion and instantaneous screw,
respectively. With the velocity model available at hand,
the velocity/force features, stiffness performance can be
further analyzed. By the first-order derivation of velocity,
accelerations would be further formulated, with which
the dynamic model is obtained. Up to this point, the inte-
grated modeling for topology, kinematic, stiffness and
dynamic is captured. Finally, both topological and dimen-
sional parameters can be taken as design variables in
optimal design, resulting in optimized topological struc-
ture with its dimensions.

Besides the methodology of integrated topology
and performance modeling and design, another pos-
sible application of the reviewed mathematical tools is
the automatic software development. It could be seen
that every step of the integrated modeling and design
is performed by algebraic expressions and computa-
tions, which facilitates this procedure to be realized in
automatic manner using computer programming lan-
guages. By applying computation software like Mat-
lab and Maple, composition, intersection and mapping
algorithms of finite and instantaneous motions based on
the three unified mathematic tools could be compiled as
modularized programs. In this way, for given motion pat-
tern, type synthesis can be automatically implemented to
obtain all the feasible robotic mechanisms. The topology
models are regarded as the displacement models. Then
performance models in terms of velocity and accelera-
tion can be directly constructed and analyzed by taking

Page 12 of 15

the first- and second-order derivation of its displace-
ment model. The automatic software in the future work
will improve the efficiency of integrated robot design and
make the methods to be easily applied by the mechanical
engineers without studying the mathematical knowledge.

7 Conclusions

Topology and performance of mechanism are the main
focuses in the development of robotic mechanism. It
has long been a desire to carry out the integrated analy-
sis and design as topology and performance are mutually
affected each other. A unified mathematical framework
is the fundamental preparation. Three mathematical
tools, ie., Lie group and Lie algebra, dual quaternion
and pure dual quaternion, finite screw and instantaneous
screw, are comprehensively reviewed. The history, finite
motion, instantaneous motion and the mapping relation
of each mathematical tool are introduced, in which the
description, computation and intersection of two types of
motions are given. A discussion on the three mathemati-
cal tools is also presented. This paper aims at providing
a reference on the mathematical tools in topology and
performance integrated analysis and design, and helps
reader select the appropriate method when implement-
ing the analysis and design of robotic mechanisms.
