machine interaction, so as to realize the comprehensive training of the strength
quality of aerobics special movements. Information collection module is used to
collect information on strength training information such as instrument, movement,
and language. The problem of phase distortion in signal transmission process is
processed by FIR filter. Through information management module, trainee
information management and training results statistics and queries are implemented.

1 Introduction

Aerobics is to shows the ability of athletes to perform complex and high-intensity exer-
cises continuously under the accompaniment of music and through the perfect comple-
tion of difficult movements. As the basis and key link of excellent aerobics exercise,
special strength training has become an important topic of scientific research [1]. The
general requirement of aerobics for strength is to have a good waist and abdomen power
and explosive force on the upper, lower extremities, and whole body. The whole set of
aerobics exercises are characterized by operation movement, transition movement, and
difficulty movement. These technical movements have high requirements for the upper
and lower extremities. Because competitive aerobics competition is carried out within a
certain period of time required by rules, it has a fairly high demand for athletes’ strength
and endurance. So in strength training, we must pay attention to strength endurance, es-
pecially speed, strength, and endurance training [2]. Therefore, the competitive aerobics
athlete special strength training is analyzed and discussed in this paper. This paper pre-
sents a fuzzy normal form algorithm, which is an intelligent fuzzy network model com-
posed of fuzzy system of input, state, and output. The fuzzy system can be replaced by a
neural network, fuzzy fusion rules, fuzzy identifiers, etc., and the given knowledge or ex-
perience can be learned by determining their weight factors and/or coefficients.

The strength training method is a series of methods and means of specialized bio-
logical modification to the human body’s motion system in order to improve the ability
of muscle work [3]. The traditional strength training method is based on the analysis of
past competitions and training cases, lacking of real-time analysis, and poor training ef-
ficiency [4]. Artificial intelligence is a kind of computer science and technology, which
includes robot, language, image recognition, and expert system. At present, artificial
intelligence technology is widely used in the field of aerobics in China, which is of great
significance for enhancing the training quality of aerobics athletes and assisting the coa-
ches to make reasonable sports plans. Therefore, the core training system of strength
quality of aerobics special movement based on artificial intelligence is proposed, and
the real-time, stable, and efficient training of strength quality of aerobics special move-
ment is realized.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the core training of
strength quality of aerobics special movements based on artificial intelligence, followed
by experimental analysis designed in section 3. Section 4 concludes the paper with

summary and future research directions.

2 Methods

2.1 System structure framework

In this paper, the design of core training of strength quality of aerobics special move-
ments includes hardware design and software design. Hardware design is to build and
connect the whole system of all equipment and the design of simulation equipment [5].
Software design is to solve the problem that all hardware can be combined into a uni-
fied system through a software system. Through the software control or the corre-
sponding software operation, the training of the special strength training simulation
system is satisfied [6]. The structural framework of the simulation training system for
strength quality of aerobics special movements is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 Structural framework of simulation training system for strength quality of aerobics
special movements

 

In Fig. 1, the system architecture framework includes the modules of sensor, receiver,

database, and analysis, and decision. At the beginning of the training, the trainer starts the
video projection, and the trainee makes the situation judgment according to the real scene
of the video, decides which technical movement to use, and trains for strength quality of the
set of technical movements. At this time, sensors collect all kinds of training instruments,
equipment, special movements, and strength quality information, and transmit them to the
receiver in time. By using analysis and judgment module, the aerobics special action is ana-
lyzed. Data and information about aerobics special movements are stores in the database.
The training system realizes the analysis and training of the strength quality of aerobics spe-
cial movement by collecting, processing, storing, and analyzing information. It is a kind of
artificial intelligence analysis process, and especially the analysis and judgment module is a
key artificial intelligence analysis process. By using the judgment module, the aerobics spe-
cial movement is analyzed autonomously and real-time [7]. It plays an important role in en-
hancing the quality of core training of aerobics special movements.

2.2 Design of system function modules

According to the overall structure of the system and the function target of the system,
the functional modules of the system are divided into the main control module, the
scenario control module, the information acquisition module, the judgment module,
and the information management module.

The main control module runs in the master computer and is responsible for human-
machine interaction [1]. Human-machine interaction performance is also an embodiment
of artificial intelligence in this system. The realized comprehensive training of strength qual-
ity includes the subject setting before training, the data processing in the training process
(processing, recording, and adjusting the situation change of the input information of the
strength of the special movement), and the evaluation of the results after the training.

The main controller selects the Atmegal280 microcontroller, which is an 8-bit
microcontroller with low energy consumption, high performance, and abundant on-
chip resources. Atmegal280 single-chip microcomputer contains 86 I/O, 16 analog
signal input interfaces, 4 serial ports, and EEPROM storage chips, as well as JTAG
simulation, so as to facilitate the programming of the system.

By collecting the signals of various training instruments, competition instruments,
special movements, and language control, the judgment and training of the trainees’
correct use of training instruments, competition instruments, special movements, and
strength qualities is realized. In order to ensure that the system does not have phase
distortion in the signal transmission of data communication, signal processing, and
image processing, the FIR filter is used in the information acquisition module. There
are three main applications of FIR filter: distributed algorithm, serial algorithm, and
parallel algorithm. The design of information acquisition module in this paper uses a
distributed algorithm of FIR filter. The structure of the FIR filter is shown in Fig. 2.
The inner product of the input x of the FIR filter and the coefficient / is the output y.

The information management module is necessary for the output of training result
data [8]. The system consists of two parts: trainee information management and train-
ing performance statistics inquiry. The functions include personnel basic information
management, and query, statistics, and printing of training results. The trainees’ infor-
mation management training results are automatically stored in the database, which
can be displayed on the screen in real-time, and queried, counted, and printed at any
time. In this paper, the information management module is used to carry out artificial
intelligence analysis on the related information of strength training for aerobics special
movements. Through the statistics of the information management and training results
of the trainees, the trainees and trainers can have an intuitive understanding of the
training results, quickly obtain feedback information, and facilitate the guidance of

training. Figure 3 shows the structure of information management module.

2.3 Software design

Taking training subject as an object, the simulation training software of strength quality
of the special movement of aerobics athletes is divided into basic subject, real scene
subject, subject video examination and evaluation module, and other auxiliary func-

tional module [3]. Each subsystem is an independent module. The system uses the

shows the software structure of the special movement strength training system.

The main control program runs in the master computer, and is mainly responsible
for the comprehensive training of all subjects. As the core of the whole training system,
the main control program also needs to consider the functions of system protection,
data encryption, and so on [10]. The program module signal collection program run-
ning in the background is the middle-ware of other interactive devices, such as the inte-
grated machine of camera and projector.

The judgment module includes a detailed analysis of the overall strength control of aer-
obics athletes and the control of the overall strength [12, 13]. The basic process is shown
in Fig. 6. The main steps include the selection of strength training video, strength data ac-
quisition, strength data experts, and artificial intelligence analysis [12, 14]. The selection
of strength training video is the initial and important step of strength training analysis,
which determines the reliability and persuasiveness of strength training structure.

In this paper, JSP page is used as a user interface. It includes the main functional in-
terfaces such as training subjects, performance evaluation, and other auxiliary func-
tional interface such as system login and user rights management. In order to reduce
the complexity of the page and improve its efficiency [15, 16], all business processes are
excluded while displaying the user interface through JPS pages, and Java scripts are not

involved at the same time [17, 18].

3 Experiment

The experiment is carried out to verify the time delay performance of the core training
system based on artificial intelligence [19, 20]. Using the proposed system, the training
system based on event-driven programming and the training system based on case
teaching, 100 strength training tests for an aerobics athlete are carried out to record
and compare the transmission delay of different training systems. The comparison re-
sults are shown in Table 1.

It is clearly evident from the Table 1 that the transmission delay of the proposed
training system is small, and far lower than the transmission delay of the other two
training systems. It shows that the transmission delay of the proposed system is low
and the real-time performance is good. To verify the simulation efficiency of the pro-
posed system, the method of measuring the time consuming of aerobics special move-
ment simulation is adopted to test the stability and rapid movement simulation of the
proposed system. The training movements of 15 aerobics athletes are taken as samples,
and the training movements of these athletes are simulated with the proposed system,
the training system based on event-driven programming, and the training system based
on case teaching [21, 22]. The time consuming is recorded and shown in Table 2.

Figure 7 is the time consuming for movement simulation of three systems.

It is clearly evident from Table 2 that the time consuming of the proposed system is
less, about within 1.32s, and as the number of movement simulations increases, the
system simulation tends to be stable and maintains at 1.24s, with an average time of
1.27 s. The motion simulation system based on event-driven programming always fluc-
tuates from 1.63s to 1.84.s. The time consuming of the training system based on event-
driven programming always fluctuates between 1.63s and 1.84s. The time consuming
of the training system based on case teaching is longer. Through the above experimen-
tal results, it can be found that the system is efficient in movement simulation, and can
shorten the simulation time of aerobics special movement.

In order to verify the stability of the proposed system, the average outage probability
of strength quality training of special movement for different systems is compared. The
comparison results are shown in Fig. 8.

It is clearly evident from Fig. 8 that under the condition of the average SNR less than
16 dB, the average outage probability of the proposed system is smaller than that of the

other two systems. When the average SNR is greater than 16 dB, the outage probability

of the three systems increases with the increase of the average SNR, but the average

outage probability growth curve of the proposed system is slow and obviously lower

than the other two systems. It shows that the proposed system has good stability.

In order to verify the memory consumption performance of the proposed system, the

proposed system, the system based on event-driven programming, and the system

based on case teaching are used to analyze the data analysis of five groups of special

It is clearly evident from Fig. 9 that the memory consumption of the training system
based on case teaching is largest. The training system based on event-driven program-
ming has larger memory consumption, while the memory consumption of the proposed
system is lower than the other two systems. It shows that by using the proposed system
to analyze the strength training data of special movements, the memory consumption
is smaller.

In order to verify the execution efficiency of the proposed system, the proposed sys-
tem, the system based on event-driven programming, and the system based on case

strength training. The execution time in the MapReduce environment is compared.

The results are shown in Fig. 10.

As shown in Fig. 10, for the training data analysis of five groups of special movement
strength, the running time of the training system based on event-driven programming
is lower than the running time of the training system based on case teaching. The run-
ning time of the proposed system is lower than that of the training system based on
event-driven programming. Experimental results show that the three systems can carry
out data analysis of the special movement strength training, but the efficiency of the
proposed system is the best.

The scalability of the proposed system is verified, that is, when the data of specific
movement strength training is more, it is verified whether it can process larger scale
data. The extensibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by using data set of specific
movement strength training (from 160 MB to 1280 MB) and comparing it with the
training system based on case teaching and the training system based on event-driven
programming. The results are shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 12 Acceleration ratio of the proposed system

It is clearly evident from the Fig. 11 that the proposed system has achieved better

scalability than the training system based on event-driven programming and the train-
ing system based on case teaching. The extensibility values of the three systems are
higher than 0.69, 0.62, and 0.55, respectively. The results show that the proposed sys-
tem has excellent scalability and adaptability for processing large-scale dataset.

In order to verify the acceleration ratio performance of the proposed system, the pro-
posed system, the training system based on event-driven programming, and the training
system based on case teaching are compared and analyzed in the same environment.
First, the acceleration ratio performance of the proposed system is evaluated with the
constant size of the three groups of real special movement strength training data, and
the experimental results are shown in Fig. 12. Secondly, the acceleration ratio perform-
ance of the three systems is compared, and the results are shown in Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 12, in the data analysis of the special movement strength training,
the proposed system can complete the analysis normally. Especially when the data node
gradually increases, the running time of the proposed system is reduced proportionally.
From Table 3, it can be seen that the execution time of the proposed system is much

lower than that of the other two systems. The results show that the proposed system
has good acceleration ratio performance and can effectively improve analysis efficiency.

The training effect of this system is analyzed from five aspects: the simulation of the
instrument, the time consuming of the system simulation, the importance of the train-
ing content, the accuracy of the power simulation, and the analysis of the information
content. The expert evaluation method is used to evaluate the results of the analysis of
15 groups of samples in Table 2 for the proposed system, the training system based on
event-driven programming, and the training system based on case teaching. The evalu-
ation score are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6.

Through the above experimental results, it can be observed that the results of the
special movement obtained with the proposed system are good in all aspects. From the
comparison results of the instrument simulation, it can be seen that the average score
of the proposed system is 96.9 points. The score of the training system based on event-
driven programming is 75.3 points, and the score of the training system based on case
teaching is only 64.3 points. The average score of the importance of the training con-
tent of the proposed system is 93.7 points. The score of the training system based on
the event-driven programming is 61.1 points and the training system based on case-
based training system is 49.7 points. It shows that the content of the proposed system
is more important for the training of the special movement strength quality. The scores
of simulation time consumption, strength simulation accuracy, and analysis information
content of the proposed system are 93.7 points, 93.3 points, and 93.7 points, respect-
ively. The score of the proposed system is far superior to the training system based on
event-driven programming and the training system based on case teaching. It shows
that the proposed system is very effective in the core training of the strength quality of

aerobics special movement.
