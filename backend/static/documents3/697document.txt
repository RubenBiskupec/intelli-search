Introduction

Adaptation of learning environments has recently become essential for confronting the
differences between the students in their needs, preferences, and learning styles. There-
fore, adaptive learning has occupied the interest of a large amount of literature and
specialized studies. Adaptive web-based system can help the student obtain informa-
tion in a form that fits the students’ characteristics and fulfills the user’s real needs
automatically over the web (Lo, Chan & Yeh, 2012).

The adaptive learning refers to the customization of the learning system by dynamic-
ally making adjustments based on learners’ preferences and learning styles (Somyiirek,
2015). It presents instructors with the possibility of providing learning opportunities
tailored to each student’s individual needs. Adaptive learning is particularly helpful for
the reduction of information overload which is frequently experienced on the Internet
or any other information system (Knutov, De Bra & Pechenizkiy, 2009). Moreover,
adaptive learning provides educators with the opportunities to develop their learning

strategies. Thus, it may contribute to improving students’ learning outcomes (Ross
et al. 2018).

One of the adaptive learning technologies is adaptive hypermedia systems. They are
alternative to the traditional “one-size-fit-all” approach. It builds a model of the aims,
preferences, and knowledge of each user and uses this model to adapt students’
learning (Brusilovsky, 2001). Therefore, adaptive hypermedia systems can be useful in
learning students with different goals and knowledge.

AHS have many techniques and methods. Literature and studies (Brusilovsky, 2001;
Bunt, Carenini & Conati, 2007; ElJanati, Maach & ElGhanami, 2019; Knutov et al.,
2009) have shown that the methods and techniques of adaptive hypermedia systems
include two basic areas: adaptive presentation and adaptive navigation. Each area has
different techniques. For instance, the adaptive presentation includes adaptive multi-
media, conditional text, flexible text, variant pages, various fragments, and various
frames. In order to design an adaptive hypermedia able to offer the best possible course
presentation, we should take some factors into consideration. Such factors primarily
include the learner’s cognitive characteristics, knowledge background, educational
preferences, etc. (Tsoulouhas, Georgiou, & Karakos, 2012).

Adaptive presentations play an important role in personalizing learning environment.
“The idea of adaptive presentation techniques is to adapt the content of a pages
accessed by a particular user to current knowledge, goals, and other characteristics of
the user” (Brusilovsky, 1997, p.13). Moreover, the adaptive presentation involves deter-
mining, based on the student and context, what information should be presented and
how it should be organized and displayed (Bunt et al., 2007). Also, the adaptively chan-
ging presentation can be used to either emphasize/reemphasize part of the content or
to suggest links to users (Knutov et al., 2009).

ElJanati et al. (2019) indicate that there is a lack of work in studying the adaptive
presentation, and the students are still finding it difficult to attend the classes due to
assigning a standard content presentation that does not meet their needs and
preferences.

This study is interested in two different techniques of adaptive presentation: adaptive
multimedia-based technique and frame-based technique. Multimedia referred to as the
melding of text, sound, photos, and video to create amazing documents and presenta-
tions (Kanellopoulos, 2009). Through the adaptive multimedia-based technique, the
content will show video, images, text, presentation, or the combination of those types
of content. Through the use of frame-based technique, all the information about a
concept is explained in frames and sub-frames that can contain paths to other frames,
examples, etc. Furthermore, depending on the learning management system, the
presentation of information pages may need to be placed in different frames/windows
and automatically be generated in the navigation structure (Knutov et al., 2009).

In general, the adaptive presentation techniques may contribute to the improvement
of the student’s learning outcomes. Learning outcomes refer to what a learner is ex-
pected to know, understand, and able to do at the end of the program (Gudeva et al.,
2012). While the researchers work in the educational field in the Faculty of Education,
they noticed a low level in students’ learning and performance, especially in the use of
applications and digital platforms in their lessons. According to UNESCO (2018),
efforts should be made to develop digital competencies for teachers/students while
Elmabaredy et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:20 Page 3 of 18

preparing them in Education Faculties. Many recent conferences also emphasize an
interest in improving students’ learning and qualification for the digital age, so this
study focuses on improving student learning outcomes related to the skills of using dis-
tance learning platforms (Google Classroom). The researchers also noticed that educa-
tional materials and content are presented in one typical form for all students, which
conflicts with the students’ needs and preferences and individual differences.

Accordingly, web-based adaptive presentation techniques WAPT may contribute to
the improvement of the student’s learning outcomes which reflect the achievement
(Schmid et al., 2009) and performance (Miller, Imrie & Cox, 1998) related to the educa-
tional technology course for undergraduate students. The achievement refers to the
knowledge and concepts acquired in an educational course (Schneider & Preckel,
2017). It is measured by the degree of achievement tests. The concept of performance
emphasizes a broad spectrum of skills (Laar, Deursen, Dijk & Haan, 2020). In the
framework of this study, performance refers to a set of skills that students practice and
apply while learning content, measured by an observation list.

Also, this study is expected to contribute to the development and provide the most
effective adaptation techniques, which can be used online to improve learning out-
comes in higher education. Moreover, it is providing scientific results which indicate
the best methods for web-based content presentation, which are appropriate for stu-
dents’ needs and preferences.

This study is organized as follows. The current section introduces the main problem
of the research. The second section presents the literature review, detailed in separate
parts containing adaptive hypermedia systems, adaptive presentation, and web-based
learning. The third section includes the research objectives and questions. Also, the
fourth section presents the methodology and procedures including participants, re-
search design, WAPT development, instruments, and data collection. The fifth section
presents the research results. Finally, the discussion and conclusion are presented in
the last section.

Literature review

Adaptive hypermedia systems (AHS)

Adaptive hypermedia systems can be defined as all hypertext and hypermedia systems
that fit student characteristics into the user model and apply this model to adapt vari-
ous visible aspects to the user (Brusilovsky, 1996). AHS builds a model that consists of
goals, preferences, and knowledge of each individual and uses these models to provide
adaptation required by the user (Lestari, Nurjanah & Selviandro, 2017).

Studies on adaptive hypermedia have become popular in recent years, due to the ex-
panded use of adaptive learning (Somyiirek, 2015); therefore, some researchers are in-
terested in developing adaptive hypermedia systems to improve and enhance students’
learning experiences. Knutov et al. (2009) introduced a survey of adaptive hypermedia
methods and techniques. Mohamad (2012) studied design, development, and evaluation
of an adaptive multimedia environment among teachers. Also, Ozyurt et al. (2012) de-
signed an adaptive hypermedia web-based system named UZWEBMAT. Learning ob-
jects were prepared in three different ways: Visual—Auditory—Kinesthetic for each
subject. According to the results, positive opinions of students became prominent and
Elmabaredy et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:20 Page 4 of 18

concluded that UZWEBMAT is a beneficial instrument for both students and teachers.
Anthony, Joseph, and Ligadu (2013) developed a web-based adaptive hypermedia sys-
tem, and the results show that students who used the adaptive system have shown an
improvement in their overall academic assessments.

In addition, Tsortanidou, Karagiannidis, and Koumpis (2017) investigated the peda-
gogical basis of adaptive hypermedia systems based on user's learning style, preferences,
and needs. Tmimi et al. (2018) proposed an intelligent and flexible model based on
adaptive hypermedia for developing and treatment educational problems. Moreover,
concerning modeling in the AHS, Khan and Mustafa (2019) designed and developed an
adaptive hypermedia system based on Merrill’s theory incorporating an appropriate se-
lection of adaptive multimedia and navigation structures to produce learner engaging
and effective learning outcomes. The results indicated that the system affects the

learner performance.

Adaptive presentation techniques
Adaptive presentation is the general term for techniques used to adapt the content of a
web page based on the user model (Surjono & Maltby, 2003). The content is adapted
by various technologies, such as frame-based technique. It is based on organizing the
basic concepts and information in the main pages, moreover, linking each page to sub-
frames that contain more information and exercises related to the concepts. Figure 1
presents an illustration for the frame-based technique.

Multimedia is based on the present of media according to each student’s preferences
and needs. Figure 2 presents an illustration for the multimedia-based technique.

Table 1 shows the differences between frame-based technique and multimedia-based
technique.

Due to the importance of adaptive presentation and its educational and instructional
features, some studies focus on developing different adaptive presentation techniques
and investigate its impact on the students’ learning. Filippidis and Tsoukalas (2009)

presented an adaptive presentation system; in this system, fragments of different images

present the same materials and the system can present the one most relevant to the

student based on the learning preferences. Rowe et al. (2010) presented the implemen-
tation and evaluation of an adaptive multimedia presentation system with contextual
supplemental support media. Tsoulouhas et al. (2012) introduced an adaptive content
presentation in asynchronous learning environments. Furthermore, Sanchez-Gordon
and Lujan-Mora (2015) presented a proposal to enhance MOOCs’ accessibility by
adapting course content presentation according to student needs, preferences, and
skills.

Agaba and Lubega (2016) developed a model to support the full adaptation presenta-
tion of learning objects with multi-format assets to improve re-usability in instruction
design. Also, Lestari et al. (2017) have come up with recommendations about the learn-
ing and adaptive presentation based on the learning style and working memory capacity
of students. Scheiter et al. (2019) developed an adaptive multimedia environment that
would support students when learning from texts and pictures. The adaptive

multimedia system was compared to a non-adaptive, static presentation of the same
materials. Results showed no differences between both learning systems in terms of
learning outcomes. Ahmadaliev et al. (2019) explained an overview of the current
trends of adaptive content presentation and sequencing in the context of adaptive edu-
cational hypermedia. Moreover, Apoki, Al-Chalabi and Crisan (2019) described the
content presentation in adaptive hypermedia, specifically, focusing on transition the
digital learning resources (text, graphic, audio, video, etc.) to adaptive learning objects
that conform to the characteristics of a learner.

Dahlan, Hussin and Ali (2019) proposed a content adaptation guideline for a different
type of learners in online learning systems, because employing the same instructional
conditions to all students can pedagogically be inefficient. For example, the use of the
same content and the same presentation method is not suitable for all students due to
their different needs and learning styles. The guideline was developed to direct the stu-
dents to the adaptation mapping depending on the information in their model. It was
carried out in four stages: organizing content, individualized content, adaptive naviga-
tion, and control level, Kumar and Ahuja (2020) presented an adaptive framework ac-
cording to learner characteristics that helps to provide the adaptive presentation and
feedback to the learner.

Web-based learning

The web-based learning model has shown benefits in enabling students to learn at any
time and in any place. It can be defined as an approach for delivering instruction to re-
mote students (Techataweewan, 2010). Web-based learning model use hyperlink and
multimedia techniques to access various online resources (Lo et al., 2012). There are
many studies that have focus on this model. For example, Wang, Li, and Chang (2004)
interested in incorporating adaptive presentation and 3D visualization into web-based
learning environments to enhance students’ learning outcomes. Furthermore, Romero
et al. (2009) proposed an advanced architecture for a personalization system to facilitate
web mining. They developed a specific web mining tool and have integrated a recom-
mender engine into the system in order to help the instructor to carry out the whole
web mining process. Techataweewan (2010) studied the efficiency of adaptive web-
based instruction for enhancing learning ability students. The findings show that the
students who learned through adaptive web-based instruction were significantly higher
in achievement than those who learned through traditional methods. In this context,
Lo et al. (2012) developed an adaptive web-based learning system according to stu-
dents’ cognitive styles. The results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the adaptive
web-based learning system. Kahraman, Sagiroglu, and Colak (2013) presented a novel
model for web-based adaptive educational hypermedia systems called SAHM (super-
vised adaptive hypermedia model); it helps to solve the problems encountered of adap-
tive hypermedia and helps developers that might develop adaptive hypermedia
applications easily, effectively, and successfully. Additionally, Wang, Kao, and Dai
(2019) developed a web-based multimedia assessment system to improve students’
knowledge acquisition under science laboratory instruction. The findings indicated that
the students in the group of the web-based system show significantly higher improve-
ments in their scientific conceptual knowledge and experimental knowledge. In this
Elmabaredy et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:20 Page 7 of 18

study, web-based learning refers to using the Moodle platform to publish and provide
the course to students anytime, anywhere, over the Internet. This was applied by pack-
aging the content with SCORM standards then uploading to Moodle platform to pub-
lish it on the web.

According to the previous works, it can be concluded that a great deal of interest
has been dedicated to studying and developing adaptive hypermedia systems in dif-
ferent educational systems (Tmimi et al., 2018; Tsortanidou et al., 2017). Also,
some studies focused on the students’ background, preferences, and cognitive
abilities through developing the adaptive content presentation (Ahmadialiev et al.,
2019; Kumar & Ahuja, 2020). Specifically, the adaptive multimedia (Khan &
Mustafa, 2019; Scheiter et al., 2019). Moreover, there is great effort for designing
web-based adaptive learning and its role in improving students’ achievements and
knowledge acquisition as opposed to the traditional learning systems. Nevertheless,
some studies focused on the adaptive presentation in general without studying its
different techniques, a few studies were interested in adaptive multimedia. There-
fore, the literature lacks studies that focus on comparing between the different pat-
terns of adaptive presentation techniques and determining the most effective
among them concerning students’ learning outcomes. There is a lack of studies
that dealt with the frame-based technique, so there is a need to know the best
method for designing the adaptive content; is it multimedia or frames? This study
distinguished a comparison between two patterns of adaptive presentation tech-
niques (multimedia/frames) and investigates their impact on enhancing students’
learning outcomes in higher education. It should be noted that both techniques
may be combined together, but this may lead to a conflict in the learning system,
and it may not be suitable for all student groups due to differences between them
(Brusilovsky, 2001; Khan, 2018; Knutov et al., 2009).

Research objectives and questions

The general objective of the current study is to develop and implement web-based
adaptive presentation techniques, specifically adaptive multimedia and frames. During
the developing of treatments, the researchers have taken into consideration the stu-
dents’ backgrounds, educational needs, and preferences. These techniques were de-
signed to enhance students’ learning outcomes in higher education. Moreover,
secondary objectives are to investigate the impact of the adaptive multimedia to en-
hance students’ outcomes in achievement and performance. Also, the study aimed at
investigating the impact of the frames to enhance students’ learning outcomes. Further-
more, the study aimed at comparing between adaptive multimedia and frames to deter-
mine which is more effective in enhancing students’ learning outcomes. Therefore, this

research seeks answers for the following questions:

e RQI: What is the effect of the adaptive multimedia-based technique on enhancing
learning outcomes in higher education?
e RQ2: What is the effect of the frame-based technique on enhancing learning

outcomes in higher education?
Elmabaredy et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:20 Page 8 of 18

e RQ3: Which technique of the WAPT (multimedia/frames) has the highest effect on

enhancing learning outcomes in higher education?

Methodology and procedures

Participants

All participants in the research experiment (” = 70) were third-year undergraduate
students at the Faculty of Education, Suez University. They were randomly selected. All
students have the pre-requirements and qualified to study the education technology
course. Besides, they have the basic skills to deal with computers and the Internet.
Moreover, they have the desire to participate and improve their achievement and skills
in an educational technology course. The participants were randomly divided into two
experimental groups: Group A (v = 35) taught content through the adaptive multi-
media technique and group B (um = 35) taught content through the frame-based
technique.

Research design

Given that the research aims at exploring the effect of the adaptive multimedia-based
technique on enhancing learning outcomes and exploring the effect of the frame-based
technique on enhancing learning outcomes, moreover, comparing between adaptive
multimedia and frames, therefore, it is justifiable in adopting a quasi-experimental
approach (Muller, 1985; Scher, Kisker & Dynarski, 2015).

We adopt a quasi-experimental approach by pre-testing the learning outcomes, then
implementing the intervention and experimental treatments, then post-test of the
learning outcomes. Accordingly, comparing the results of pre-test and post-test to de-
termine the effect size in the participants’ behavior was included in the analysis. There-
fore, instruments included an achievement test to measure the students’ theoretical
knowledge, as well as the observation list to measure students’ skills performance. The
following Fig. 3 shows the research quasi-experimental design.

The educational technology course was chosen to apply the experimental treatments
within its context. This course is one of the curricula taught for third-year students at
the Faculty of Education. It contains the knowledge and skills necessary to using and
employing the open source platforms at teaching. Therefore, the instructional materials

focused on using Google classroom platform https://edu.google.com/products/class-

room. The context was prepared in five lessons that include tasks such as install and

class materials, create assignments, and share questions.

Develop web-based adaptive presentation techniques (WAPT):

In this study, the approach of designing and developing adaptive presentation tech-
niques was made according to the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implemen-
tation, Evaluation) model, because it is a standard model and characterized by clarity
and coverage of all instructional design phases (Battou et al., 2017; Shelton & Saltsman,
2011). In the analysis phase, the characteristics of the target students, knowledge and
skills needed, general objectives, and the course content were analyzed and identified.
Besides, in the design phase, the script was designed as well as preparation of the
behavioral objectives, and selection of the sources and multimedia were made. In the
development phase, the authoring software (Photoshop—Camtasia studio—Audacity—Ar-
ticulate storyline) was used to produce the learning resources and multimedia.
Moreover, preparation of the learning content and designing the adaptive presentation
techniques were included.

Prepare the framework of adaptive presentation with the multimedia technique by
designing the background test and preferred media poll of the student. Furthermore,
support the content with a list of resources and multimedia, which display according to
each student’s preferences and needs. Where Kanellopoulos (2009) referred to the
adaption of multimedia content according to user preferences and system constraints,
representative examples are adaptive hypermedia and web personalization. Also, pre-
pare the framework of adaptive presentation with the frame technique by providing the
concepts and skills of dealing with Google Classroom platform in the main pages, then
provide a detailed explanation of each of the concept and skills in multiple sub-frames,
as well as designing more examples and exercises in other sub-frames, and then linking
all the main and sub-frames together. All frames are displayed according to the stu-
dent’s needs, whereas Knutov et al. (2009) emphasized that depending on the learning
management systems, the presentation of information pages may need to be placed in
different frames. The following Fig. 4 shows the framework of WAPT.

In the implementation phase, the contents were packaged according to SCORM
standards, then uploaded to Moodle platform to publish it on the web. Finally, in the
evaluation phase, the instructional design was introduced to some experts; accordingly,
some adjustments have made to improve adaptive presentation techniques. Figure 5
shows the publish WAPT online, and Fig. 6 shows the preferred media selection for
each student. Moreover, Fig. 7 presents a scene from multimedia-based technique, also
the Figs. 8 and 9 shows scenes from the frame-based technique.

Instruments

To measure the learning outcomes and data collection, an achievement test and obser-
vation list were developed. Achievement test aimed to measure the students’ acquisition
of knowledge and concepts of the context. To prepare the achievement test, we de-
signed the specification table and formulated the test questions which included 40
multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Then, the achievement test was developed online
based on Moodle platform. Chaikina et al. (2018) consider the electronic environment

SPSS software was used to verify the test stability by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha
coefficient, where its value was 0.77. On the other hand, the observation list aimed to
measure the students’ skills performance in the context applications. Therefore, it in-
cluded phrases that describe the expected performance of the students. After preparing
the list in an initial form, we presented it to some experts for their opinions and obser-

vations. Also, the observation list stability was calculated according to the observers’

that the observation list has high stability.

Data collection

An introductory meeting was held with the participants to inform them about the topic
and objectives of the research and encourage and motivate them to participate. More-
over, the students’ data were added to participants’ list in the learning platform, and
the username and password for each student were configured in order to enroll them
in system.

During the second semester of the academic year 2018/2019, the pre-test was ap-
plied. The students took the achievement test through the Moodle platform.
Whereas we applied the performance observation in the technology lab, then the
pre-test data were collected. At the beginning of the intervention and experimental
treatment, a practical demonstration to all the students was presented to explaining
how they can sign in to the platform and view the content and interact with the

system online. Then group A was directed to the adaptive presentation based on

multimedia technique, and group B was directed to the adaptive presentation based
on frame technique. However, students’ learning and their activity were tracked
through the Moodle platform via the Internet.

After finishing the experimental treatment, we applied the post-test. The students
took the achievement test. Furthermore, the observation list of the students’ perform-
ance was implemented. After completing the post-test, data were collected. After that,
the results were analyzed by using the SPSS, and the descriptive statistics of the results
were calculated. Moreover, a paired samples t test was used to compare the differences
between the pre-test and post-test and calculate the effect on behavior which resulted
from the experimental treatment. Also, an independent samples ¢ test was used to com-
pare the differences between the two groups’ scores in the post-test and calculate the
higher effect of multimedia and frames.

e RQI: What is the effect of the adaptive multimedia-based technique on enhancing

learning outcomes in higher education?

To answer this question, a paired samples ¢ test was used to verify whether there
were Statistically significant differences between pre-test and post-test. Then the mean
scores of the students in group A were compared, as shown in Table 2.

The results showed statistically significant differences between students’ scores in
pre-test and post-test for achievement and performance in favor of the post-test. Also,
the calculated t value for achievement and performance were (¢ = 8.35, p < 0.05; t = 70,

p < 0.05), respectively. These values are statistically significant.

e RQ2: What is the effect of the frame-based technique on enhancing learning out-

comes in higher education?

To answer this question, the mean scores of group B were compared in pre-test and
post-test using the paired samples ¢ test. Table 3 shows the results of the descriptive
statistics and paired samples f test.

The results showed statistically significant differences between the scores of group B
in pre-test and post-test for achievement and performance in favor of the post-test.
The calculated t value for achievement and performance (t = 8.8, p < 0.05; t = 45.25, p

< 0.05), respectively, show that these values are statistically significant.

e RQ3: Which technique of the WAPT (multimedia/frames) has the highest effect on

enhancing learning outcomes in higher education?

To answer this question, an independent samples ¢ test was used to investigate
whether there were statistically significant differences between group A and group B in
post-test results. Therefore, the mean scores were compared, as shown in Table 4.

Results in Table 3 show that the students in group A had a mean score of 23.74 and
the students in group B had a mean score of 17.83 in the post-test of achievement (¢ =
4.9, p > 0.05). Besides, the students in group A had a mean score of 181.5, whereas the
students in group B had a mean score of 172 in the post-test of performance observa-
tion (¢ = 4.86, p > 0.05). Figure 10 shows a graph of these results.

Discussion

The results indicated a significant improvement in achievement and performance for
students in each experimental group due to the impact of WAPT. This includes an ef-
fect of the adaptive multimedia on enhancing learning outcomes among the students in

group A. Besides, the results showed the effect of frame-based technique on enhancing
learning outcomes among the students in the second experimental group B. Moreover,
the comparison results showed that the adaptive multimedia-based technique had a
relatively highest effect than the frame-based technique.

These results can be interpreted in the light of a combination of factors. There are
possibilities of the adaptive presentation in identifying the students’ backgrounds and
educational preferences, then adapted with the available information. Accordingly, each
student is directed to the appropriate path based on their information and knowledge
needs. The reason for this is that it helps students to focus on the knowledge and ex-
perience that they need while learning as affirmed by Surjono and Maltby (2003) and
Tsoulouhas et al. (2012). Furthermore, the techniques have provided individual learning
for each student according to his speed and self-progress. So, the learning environment
was more flexible, personalized, and free to learn. It contributes to improving the stu-
dents’ learning outcomes according to Brusilovsky (2012) and Ross et al. (2018).

Organize the content into lessons and specific topics, Also, divide the complex skills
into sub-skills, then organize and display in a logical order. This assists students to
understand the relationships between learning aspects as well as providing various ac-
tivities and exercises within each lesson, as shown in Brusilovsky (2012). This also en-
courages students to do these activities and achieve maximum benefit, thus improving
their performance. In addition, the diversity of adaptive multimedia makes the learning
environment richer in resources. This diversity also attracts the students’ attention and
increases the use of their different senses appropriately during the learning. Conse-
quently, it resulted in improving the learning outcomes for the students according to
Cutts, Davies, Newell, and Rowe (2009, 2019); Khan and Mustafa (2019); and Knutov
et al. (2009).

Our results agree with the findings in the literature (Bikanga-Ada, 2018; Lestari et al.,
2017; Mohamad, 2012; Popenici & Kerr, 2017; Tarpin-Bernard & Habieb-Mammar,
2005; Techataweewan, 2010; Tsoulouhas et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2019) which found
that adaptive hypermedia techniques have a positive effects on improving the student’
learning outcomes. Nevertheless, it differs with Ross et al. (2018) that showed no im-
provement in students’ learning outcomes. Moreover, the present results confirm the
principles of some educational theories, such as the constructivist theory and cognitive
load theory (Sweller, 1994). Also, the results agree with the roles of a web-based learn-
ing strategy in improving learning environments (Jolliffe, Ritter & Stevens, 2001).

Conclusion

Adaptation of learning is an important educational issue to confront the differences be-
tween students at any education level for they differ in their educational needs,

preferences, and learning styles. Therefore, technology and techniques should be used
to achieve learning adaptation and personalization to improve the students’ learning
outcomes. In this study, we dealt with AHS; therefore, two techniques of WAPT were
developed as two treatments. When developing frame-based technique in this study, we
have included multiple paths that directed each student to suitable materials according
to his needs and previous knowledge. While in the multimedia-based technique, we
embed interactive video and infographic as a basic media besides the other technique
which adapts to each student’s preferences.

In light of the results, we conclude that employing web-based adaptive presentation
was generally positive and helped in improving students’ achievement and performance.
Moreover, both techniques helped in providing freedom and flexibility in learning, per-
sonalizing the learning environment, and supporting the environment with hypermedia
and multiple sources via the web.

This study and its results can be useful for teaching staff in improving the students’
learning in higher education, and use the instruments to test the learning outcomes.
Moreover, designers, curriculum developers, and educational decision-makers can
benefit from this study concerning the employment of web-based techniques to develop
methods of designing and presenting the educational courses. Also, it can attract

attention to the consideration of students’ characteristics, needs, and educational pref-
erences when designing e-learning environments.

However, the adaptive presentation techniques which developed in this study were
applied to a sample of third-year students in the Faculty of Education in specific de-
partments. It does not exceed the other students in different departments, levels, and
colleges in higher education. Hence, there is a need for further research that can ex-
pand the scope of this research beyond the different classes of students in higher edu-
cation to generalize the advantage of the idea. Consequently, we suggest further
research to investigate the impact of other techniques of adaptive hypermedia systems
and adaptive presentation on enhancing students’ learning outcomes in higher educa-
tion. In addition, comparison of different adaptive learning techniques identifies the
best effect in improving student learning and provides scientific results that support
the development of learning in higher education.
