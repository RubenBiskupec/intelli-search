effect on both the learning achievements and the attitudes of the students. A strategy for
improving the quality of explanation of the students during collaborative concept mapping
is to enable them to externalize their thinking in their private spaces beforehand. However,
students may face difficulties when they need to integrate their individual propositions with
the group concept map. This study employs the reciprocal kit-lbuild (RKB) approach to help
students externalize their ideas, understand and clarify their partners’ perspectives,
integrating with their comprehension, hoping they can construct a high-quality
collaborative product. The study is conducted in a linear algebra class in an Indonesian
university. The effect of the RKB as learning activities on the group outcomes is evaluated.
How students change their propositions, from the individual to the collaborative phase,
following the visualization of the difference map provided by the RKB system is also
presented. Perceptions of the students during these activities are examined to measure the
effectiveness of the approach from the viewpoints of the participants. The findings convey
that the RKB is promising for learning in a collaborative context despite some limitations in
the practical classroom experimental settings.

Introduction

Collaborative learning is defined as a situation in which two or more people attempt to
learn something together (Dillenbourg 1999). In line with the Social Constructivist
Theory of Vygotsky (1978), some previous researches have attached great importance
to the students’ interactions as a fundamental role in collaborative learning (Baines
et al. 2009; Webb 2009). The collaboration does not merely happen just because indi-
viduals are co-present (Baines et al. 2009; Roschelle and Teasley 1995; Webb 2009).

Instructional strategies attempted to employ scripts, scenarios, or representational tools
for encouraging the learner to collaborate.

In collaborative learning, individual learners need to make a continuous effort to construct
and maintain group-shared knowledge (Roschelle and Teasley 1995). They may have forgotten
prior discussion or feeling difficult to remember what they have discussed or co-constructed
(Jeong and Hmelo-Silver 2016). An external representation tool assisted the learner in articu-
lating and maintaining shared focus during discourse (Fischer et al. 2002; Suthers 2006; van
Boxtel et al. 2002). A concept map has been mainly utilized as a representational tool in a col-
laborative setting to facilitate group discussion, as well as to communicate complex ideas (Fi-
scher et al. 2002; Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017; Suthers 2006; van Boxtel et al. 2000).

A concept map is a graphical tool for organizing and representing knowledge which
consists of concepts and relationships among these concepts to facilitate meaningful
learning (Novak and Cafias 2008). In a concept map, the nodes represent concepts, while
the links with its descriptive labels explain the relationships among the concepts. Co-
construction of a concept map is an effort to co-create a representational tool of group
understanding. It allows learners to be consistent and gain convergence, rather than just
through a dialogue (Jeong and Hmelo-Silver 2016; Roschelle and Teasley 1995).

Previous research on collaborative concept mapping has extended the prior activity
by creating an initial design of a concept map individually to trigger more questions
and conflicts among learners (van Boxtel et al. 2000). This individual preparatory phase
contributed to promoting awareness of own understanding and limitations, better ex-
planation, and more elaboration (de Weerd et al. 2017; Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017; van
Boxtel et al. 2002). However, learners also faced difficulty in integrating different ideas
while creating a map collaboratively in a public space. In a study conducted by Gracia-
Moreno et al. (2017), more than half of the individual nodes were not transferred to
the group public space, and the students were in tendency to refuse other ideas through
online medium without asking for confirmation.

The study proposes an approach to see the perspective of others before co-creation of
concept map by reconstructing the partner’s map and discussing the similarities and dif-
ferences of two maps with the reciprocal kit-build (RKB) system (Wunnasri et al. 2018a).
After students externalize their thinking and understand the partners’ perspectives, they
are expected to build a shared understanding and find a better solution for the problem
task. The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of the RKB approach on collabora-
tive concept mapping in a practical classroom. A linear algebra class is selected as the
study subject since the class implemented various collaborative learning approaches for
both in-class and online activities. The research questions of the study are as follows: Does
the RKB approach affect co-construction of knowledge with concept maps? If so, to what
extent? The study focuses on identifying the effectiveness from the end-products (collab-
orative maps), the patterns of map changes from individuals to groups, and the percep-

tions of the students while following the learning activities.

Collaborative concept mapping
Fischer et al. (2002) divided collaborative learning process into four stages:

externalization of task-relevant knowledge, elicitation of task-relevant knowledge,
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:19 Page 3 of 22

conflict-oriented consensus building, and integration-oriented consensus building.
Using a concept map as a visualization tool in collaborative learning has the potential
to support all these processes. The externalization of abstract concepts and the rela-
tionship between them can serve as a common ground to ensure that interaction part-
ners understand each other (Jeong and Hmelo-Silver 2016; Roschelle and Teasley
1995). This representation may trigger a question and lead to elicitation of knowledge
(Fischer et al. 2002) because students’ thinking turns into explicit for sharing and mis-
interpretation can be clarified (Beers et al. 2006; Correia et al. 2008). The concept map
also reduces the ambiguity of utterances and different views is easily recognizable
resulting in cognitive conflicts and negotiation of meaning to reach a consensus (Chiu
et al. 2000; Fischer et al. 2002; Gao et al. 2013; Jeong and Hmelo-Silver 2016; Stahl
et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2017).

Some previous researches have examined the effect of collaborative concept mapping
on attitudes. Their findings postulated that collaborative concept mapping can facilitate
group motivational-emotional experiences and reduced participants’ anxieties (Czerniak
and Haney 1998), increasing group motivations (Beers et al. 2006). Students took more
responsibility for learning (van Boxtel et al. 2002), while the quantity of group inter-
action is significantly correlated to the group concept mapping performance (Chiu
et al. 2000). In summary, studies posited that concept mapping has a positive effect on
both students’ attitudes and learning achievements (Basque and Lavoie, 2006; Czerniak
and Haney, 1998).

Before creating a concept map collaboratively, some studies suggested an individual
preparation phase by creating a design of the concept map in the learners’ own private
spaces (de Weerd et al. 2017; Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017; van Boxtel et al. 2000). By de-
signing an initial map individually, students had time to reflect, organize, and develop
their understanding which leads to better explanation during the discussion (Gao 2008;
Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017; van Boxtel et al. 2000). They also asked more questions and
demonstrated more openness exhibited to group contributions because they were
allowed to elicit information that is relevant to their ambiguity from their partner (de
Weerd et al. 2017; Gao 2008; van Boxtel et al. 2002). Furthermore, the groups with in-
dividual preparation outperformed the group without preparation in their post-tests
(van Boxtel et al. 2000).

Students in the individual preparation group encountered difficulties in sharing devel-
oped ideas and integrating them into public knowledge in the group map (Gracia-Mor-
eno et al. 2017; van Boxtel et al. 2000). When students worked in a personal
workspace, they preferred refusing others’ ideas by deleting them directly in the digital
space instead of opposing them through talk (Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017). Furthermore,
the externalization of students’ thinking is an important requirement to find misrepre-
sentation. When students’ knowledge is visible, they can exchange their own under-
standing and track similarities and differences between each other’s representation. At
this stage, students may face socio-cognitive conflicts that are considered necessary for
conceptual changes in collaborative learning (Limon 2001; Nastasi and Clements 1992).
Socio-cognitive conflict is defined as an interaction, active engagement of participants
in a cognitive controversy or confrontation leading to points of view, interpretations,
different solutions, which makes group members overcome the differences together
and come up with joint solutions (Iancu 2014). Based on those recommendations, the
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:19 Page 4 of 22

current study highlights that concept map sharing and negotiation activities have the
potential to foster conceptual changes. Active inquiry to resolve conflicts is one of the
critical roles in knowledge construction, which can increase the number of shared-
knowledge that all group members had after collaboration (Beers et al. 2006; Chan
et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2018; Kalishman et al. 2012; Roschelle 1992; Roschelle and Teas-
ley 1995; van Boxtel et al. 2000).

When students’ prior knowledge is shared, they can be aware of the partners’ under-
standing, which is essential to reduce miscommunication (Nickerson 1999). When
knowledge of a partner’s information is lacking, a self-heuristic is applied to estimate
the knowledge of others, ie., using one’s knowledge. Imputing one’s knowledge to
others may result in overestimation, a situation when speakers expected the audience
to know everything they know (Nickerson 1999). Sharing the partner’s concept map
and the access to a resource underlying this knowledge improved the efficiency of
knowledge co-construction because students did not need to collect information and
able to directly start the problem-solving process (Engelmann and Hesse 2010).

The KB concept mapping approach

The Kit-Build (KB) is a re-constructional closed-ended approach to concept mapping
activity in which students construct a map based on predefined nodes and links ex-
tracted from an expert’s map (Hirashima et al. 2011; Hirashima et al. 2015). Figure 1 il-
lustrates the activity between a teacher and his/her students during KB concept
mapping. Given the set of unconnected map components, the students need to find out
the map structure. After the students upload their maps, the KB system will perform a
propositional-level similarity measure and show the comparison results in the KB
analyzer as feedback to the teacher. The analyzer displays three types of links: matching
link, excessive link, and lacking link. A matching link represents that the student cre-

ates the same proposition as appeared in the expert map, an excessive link indicates

that students create a new proposition that has not been defined by the teacher, while a

lacking link illustrates a teacher’s proposition that is not reconstructed by the students.
The teacher use this information to assess learners’ understanding of the given mate-
rials, identify students’ misconceptions, and adjust the next instructional strategy
(Yoshida et al. 2013; Hirashima et al. 2015; Kitamura et al. 2016; Hayashi et al. 2017;
Pailai et al. 2017).

The current study extended the use of the KB approach to support communication
and build shared knowledge between a pair in a computer-supported collaborative
learning setting. Unlike the standard KB, a dyad in the RKB has a similar level of ex-
pertise (novice-novice), and each group member is allowed to define the initial map.
The initial map components are decomposed to be reconstructed by the collaborating
partner. Subsequently, the RKB system performs similarity matching between the initial
map and the partner’s reconstructed map. The similarity results, in the form of match-
ing, excessive, and lacking links, are then presented to the learners to aid group discus-
sion afterward. This approach allows students to externalize their thinking in a private
space, elicits knowledge of partners, and resolves conflict through visualization of a dif-
ference map. By doing so, students had the opportunity to reflect their thinking on
their maps as well as their partners’ maps. Thus, incorrect notions became fine-grained
and challenging, which is necessary to improve the quality of the final concept map
(Roth & Roychoudhury, 1993). Inducing cognitive conflict by presenting anomalous
data or contradictory information is one of the most common teaching strategies re-
garding conceptual change implemented in the classroom (Limon, 2001).

Initial studies of the RKB approach showed that it promoted productive discussion
between partners compared to the group without reconstruction and difference map-
supported discussion (Wunnasri et al. 2018a). The RKB map also encouraged the pair
of partners to understand each other based on the similarity score of the individual’s
map after discussion (Wunnasri et al. 2018b). Their findings demonstrated that the
RKB can be used to share understanding as preparation for collaboration. However,
they have not evaluated the effect of applying this approach to collaborative knowledge
building, so far. Hence, the study evaluated the collaborative product (group map) after
the discussion guided by the KB visualization. The current study is also implemented

in a practical classroom and gains the perspectives of the participants.

Methods

Participants and context of the study

The unit of analysis of the study was Computer Science (CS) students from a large
public university in Indonesia (” = 44). Since all students were belong to the Faculty of
Computer Science, more male students were included in this research (nm = 32). Most
participants were freshmen (” = 39) in their second semester. They worked in groups
of two, which were freely selected by the students so that they could work on the task
conveniently. When students worked in a small group, they exhibited structures and
leadership to sustain the continuity of the discourse and regulated their cognitions
more than in a general class discussion (Junus et al. 2014). Group randomization could
not always be applied for the experiment in a practical classroom. Randomization of
group members would be necessary to ensure the fairness of the treatment for all par-
ticipants; however, based on suggestions from the responsible class teacher, the
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:19 Page 6 of 22

students were allowed to choose their own pair so that they would not be reluctant to
collaborate.

This study was carried out on a core subject in Computer Science and Information
System major named Linear Algebra which is a substantive core subject for under-
graduate students. However, since the experiment was not conducted on its regular
term, only one course was offered. This course provides students with the skill to solve
problems related to vector and matrix algebra, as well as to develop mathematical rea-
soning skills (clarity, consistency, and logic). Problem-solving skills are essential to ad-
vance learning in CS-related topics. To achieve these learning outcomes, the teacher
implemented the constructivism and student-centered learning approach during the 14
weeks course period. Both face-to-face and online courses were utilized as the learning
environments. The students were engaged in various collaborative learning activities
such as online discussion, think-pair-share, and jigsaw technique.

A preliminary study of students’ preparedness level in the computer-based learning
environment from the previous classes revealed that students had a good technological
competency, a moderate competency in interaction with learning content, but lacked
interaction skills with their learning community (Kasiyah et al. 2017). Therefore, the
use of concept maps for expressing students’ ideas and as a common ground during
discussion aligned with the teacher’s previous challenges on similar classes. Moreover,
the students were familiar with map building concepts, since the teacher had modeled
concept map creation, as well as asked the students to create their maps after she fin-
ished a topic.

The experiment was conducted in a laboratory where students might choose to use
the provided computers or their laptops. The students were placed side by side in pairs
(Fig. 2). The results of this experiment were accepted as a part of the mid-term exams.
A single group study design was employed in the class since the results will affect the
final grades of the students who completed the course.

Learning topics and activities
In this study, students were requested to create a concept map individually and collab-
oratively. There were two lessons covered in the concept map, which are general vector
space and inner product space. Some learning objectives of these courses were as fol-
lows: students can explain general vector space, identify a set that is a vector space, and
explain the definition of inner product function and inner product space.

During high school, the students became familiar with the concept of the vector in
R? and R°, but not in a more abstract space such as matrices or differential functions

over [d, b] space. After completing these topics, students were expected to do accom-
modation from the concept of a vector as an entity with length and magnitude, to a
vector as an element of vector space with the length and magnitude that calculated
based on the defined inner product space. Students were also expected to understand
that an inner product function is a function that maps VxV to R and must satisfy the
following four axioms: additivity, homogeneity, positivity, and symmetry. The axioms
are preconditions for defining an inner product function. It should be attached to the
function, not to a space V.

Before giving assignments to the students, the teacher wrote a concept map that in-
volved essential concepts in these lessons. It consisted of fifteen nodes and fourteen
links (Fig. 3). The nodes were extracted and became predefined nodes for the students.
The students had to find the relationships between those concepts (nodes) and pro-
vided linking words by themselves. The nodes were as follows: vector, vector space,
inner product space, directed line segment, additivity axiom, homogeneity axiom, posi-
tivity axiom, symmetry axiom, domain: VxV, codomain: R, inner product function, or-
thogonal projection, the distance between two vectors, length of a vector, and the angle
between two vectors.

During the experiment, the students used a web-version of the RKB system (Fig. 4).
Before the session, a video tutorial on how to use the system was presented to the stu-
dents. A brief tutorial about concept mapping activity and how to create a simple map
with the KB system was provided at the beginning of the experiment to ensure they
were familiar with the assignment and the system.

The experiment was administered for about 2 h and divided into two phases: individ-
ual phase and collaborative phase. The students created an initial map phase (25 min)
and reconstructed a KB map, given a set of unconnected nodes and links (kit) from
their partner’s maps (20 min), in the individual phase. They conducted a discussion fa-
cilitated by visualization of the similarities and differences between the two maps (10
min) and created a group map collaboratively (30 min) during the collaborative phase.

Fig. 4 The user interface to create an individual map or a group map

 

At the first individual phase, the students received predefined concepts (nodes) and

were required to define the links (connection) between those concepts which enabled
them to express their own understanding. The nodes were already defined by the
teacher in the expert’s map (see Fig. 4). The availability of the initial nodes served as
key concepts that enabled participants to brainstorm other related concepts and
proceed more efficiently (Gao 2008). The students could not add a new node to help
them maintain shared focus during discussion, but they could leave out some irrelevant
nodes (if any). Next, a set of unconnected nodes and links extracted by the system from
each individual map was presented only to their partners. Each partner was then re-
quested to build a new map based on those components, which is called the KB map.
After this reconstruction activity, the system performed a propositional-level exact
matching to identify the similarities and differences between the initial map and the KB
map. The system compared the connecting line (links) as well as the linking words that
defined the relationship between two nodes. Afterward, each group conducted a discus-
sion guided by difference map visualization, consisting of matching links, excessive
links, and lacking links. The matching link represents that the partner connected the
same link and linking words as in the initial map. While the excessive link denotes a
new connection that only appeared in the partner’s map and the lacking link signifies
initial linking words that could not be reconstructed by the partner. Subsequently, to
finalize the learning activity outcomes, each group constructed a single concept map
collaboratively. The latest phase demanded more time since several groups needed

extra time to conclude their final works, while some others had finished their task earl-

ier. Other learning resources such as course slides, the Internet, or textbook were open
to the students and they were allowed to read and use them.

After the experiment, the teacher provided feedback to students in the classroom.
During the feedback session, the teacher explained the most common mistakes that ap-
peared in the maps and showed some examples of the correct propositions. The feed-
back session was valuable because the students were informed of their misconceptions,
and they learned how to build a good concept map. This session was held within 30

min.

Data collection and analysis

The RKB system recorded all students’ individual maps, KB maps, and group maps.
As in a common classroom, the teacher evaluated the students’ individual and
group maps. The similarities between the individual and the group maps might be
an indicator of individual inputs to the group achievements, therefore similarities
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:19 Page 10 of 22

of propositions written in those maps were identified. Visualization in KB analyzer
(e.g., matching, lacking, and excessive links) was used to categorize the similarities
of propositions. In addition, a survey delivered after the experiment was analyzed
to gain the perceptions of the participants.

Concept map scoring

The teacher developed a grading rubric to evaluate students’ concept maps that used
the expert’s map as a criterion map (Osmundson et al. 1999). The teacher categorized
the types of information that should be included in the map, not merely a propositional-
level matching. Therefore, it did not rule out the possibility that there is a variation on the
map structure or the linking words which presented similar information (Chung et al.
1999). This scoring procedure involved comparing the similarities between students’ pro-
duced maps and the expert’s map, regarding the map contents and structures, which also
has been practiced in other concept mapping studies (C. H. Chiu 2004; Chiu et al., 2000;
Chiu et al. 2000; Kinchin et al. 2005). Such a scoring approach is reliable to measure
domain-specific knowledge with a strong positive correlation to other content knowledge
measures such as writing task (Herl et al. 1996).

Moreover, the teacher has considered students constructed propositions when finaliz-
ing the rubric. A full score was given to the map which contains all relations with cor-
rect linking words. A zero score was given to any proposition when the essential link
(relation) was unavailable, or the linking words were not defined correctly. Every mis-
take will get a penalty based on the error type (Table 1).

Proposition similarity

Every student constructed a concept map three times, both individually and collabora-
tively. The study identified how students transfer their individual propositions to form
group propositions. A propositional-level matching was utilized to identify the similar-
ity between these propositions. First, the same relationship (connecting line) between
the individual maps, KB maps, and group maps was identified. If both maps had the
same connecting line, the linking words were taken and pre-processed by normalizing
the text to lower case, removing punctuations, and stemming. Next, cosine similarity
matching between the represented vectors of the linking words was applied to finalize
the process. The same linking words means that they had a similarity score of 1.

Fatal error The students did not draw an essential link between the two nodes. —10

The students created a wrong definition, e.g., the vector was defined as a directed line
segment; the domain and codomain were linked to the inner product space/general
vector space, not to the function; a vector space was defined as a subspace of an
inner product space.

 

Moderate — The students connected a partially incorrect relation, e.g., the measurement-related —5
error nodes were connected to the vector and not to the inner product function; the
axiom-related nodes were connected to the inner product space, not to the inner
product function.

Minor error The students described partially incorrect linking words, but the relation was correct, —2
eg., a “must” word was not included when defining a relation to the axioms.

Questionnaire

After the experiment, a survey questionnaire was conducted to examine the students’ per-
spectives on the RKB approach for creating a collaborative concept map. The questions were
designed based on the preliminary results of the experiment. The survey covered items re-
garding the perspectives of the students on the task itself (e.g., attractiveness and stimulation
scales) and the system used (or non-task; e.g., perspicuity scale). The questionnaire scales
were adopted from the User Experience Questionnaire, an Indonesian version (Laugwitz
et al. 2008; Santoso et al. 2016). Since the aim of the study was to examine the perceptions
of the students on every stage of the study approach, only three representative items were
selected which were repeated for each stage (Fig. 6). The final sub-scales of the study con-
sisted of 15 close-ended items (Table 2), where students were requested to rate the re-
sponse set from 1 to 7 scale (left-to-right), and answer open-ended questions. The six
open-ended questions were given to uncover the positive and negative experiences
of the students during the experiment (e.g., “Mention the most interesting mo-
ments encountered while you were asked to create a concept map from your friend

Results

Overall group performance

This section of the study revealed how the quality of concept maps varied from the in-
dividual to the collaborative phase. The central tendency of individual and group con-
cept maps was illustrated in Table 3. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to
compare individual and group map scores. The results of the group maps (M = 90, SD
= 7.31) showed increasing scores compared to individual maps (M = 72.21, SD =
18.22), t(20) = 4.92, p < .01. The observed standardized effect size was large (Cohen’s d
= .87). The standard deviation (SD) of group map scores also became lower, compared
to individual scores. Some prior studies also used group maps to measure the effect of
concept mapping in computer-supported learning on task performance (Chiu et al.
2000; Stoyanova and Kommers 2002).

Figure 7 depicts the differences between the averages of individual scores and the group
map scores. A positive value shows an increasing score while a negative value represents
otherwise. Eighteen out of 22 groups increased their scores, 3 groups got a similar score,
while 1 group decreased their scores. Furthermore, the group ALG 18 was omitted from
the analysis because the individual and group maps received full marks (100 points).

Changes of concept map quality were indicated from the decrease of errors in the
group propositions (Table 4). The percentage of false propositions was reduced from
36 to 19%. Specifically, there was a change from the number of false propositions with

fatal errors. The reduction of fatal error propositions affected the increasing number of

true propositions or moderate/minor error propositions.

Figure 8 shows an example of a set of maps generated by group ALG 12 during the indi-
vidual and collaborative phases. The main difference between the initial maps is the Individ-
ual 1 connected the measurement-related concepts (e.g., length of vector, angle between
vector, distance between vector, and orthogonal projection) to the inner product space,
while the Individual 2 linked between the measurement-related concepts to the inner prod-
uct function. The KB maps were reconstructed based on the initial map components. The
similarities and differences between the initial maps and the reconstructed maps were visu-
alized to aid learners during the discussion. Finally, in the group map, they created the links

as in the Individual 2’s map, which is similar to the teacher’s map (Fig. 3).

The pattern of students’ propositions from the individual map to the group map

The process of knowledge co-construction was preceded by the externalization of indi-
vidual knowledge and the sharing of ideas between partners through concept maps re-
construction. During the experiment, students did not receive any feedback from the

teacher, but they could read other learning resources such as textbooks, course slides,

Fig. 8 Sample of individual maps and group map generated by group ALG12

or the Internet. This section explained the results obtained from students’ propositions

in every stage.

In the initial stage, all students wrote 582 propositions. From these propositions, the
partner constructed 75.26% (m = 438) matching links and 24.74% (m = 144) lacking
links. Based on the number of matching links, the students could reconstruct most of
the propositions that originated from their partner’s map, which implied that they
could find the initial maps structures. The number of excessive links as many as 141,
which means that there are three lacking links that did not become new propositions.
The presences of the excessive and lacking links indicated that there were misunder-
standings or disagreement between the group members.

It was then identified how students follow the visualization of the RKB links in the
group propositions. When constructing a map collaboratively, all group members can
determine whether they will use the same proposition as in the individual map, pre-
serve the relation (connecting line) but modify the linking words, or create a different

proposition. Figure 9 shows how the students adopted these reconstructed links to
compose group propositions. Most matching links have included in the group proposi-
tions with the same connecting line (81%, 1 = 354). Most of the excessive links (60%, 1
= 84) were used to compose group propositions, but more than half of the lacking links
were not used. The students modified the linking words from matching links, lacking

links, and excessive links with portions of 56%, 22%, and 47%, respectively.

KB visualization and group performance on the task

As mentioned above, the individual propositions written in the initial and KB maps
were generally adopted to become group propositions. In this section, the distribution
of the correctness level of follow-up propositions in the group map was presented. Fig-
ure 10 reveals that these propositions are mainly correct. Students thought deeply
about the propositions and found out the correct representation. Besides, Pearson’s
correlation analysis depicted that there was a moderate positive correlation between
the score differences and the number of excessive links presented in the KB analyzer
(R(21) = 0.58, p < .01).

Students’ perceptions of the RKB approach

Figure 11 displays the results of closed-ended items. Overall, students considered that this

5.00. The perceptions of the students revealed that the KB was valuable for integrating
ideas in a group, eliciting information from the partner, and discussing differences in
ideas. Consistently, these three activities were getting the highest scores on the attractive-
ness scale. The students also found that discussion and integration were the most compli-
cated parts, along with understanding the comprehension of their partners.

Based on the open-ended questionnaire, more than half of the students (60%) agreed
that the most attractive phase was the phase when they could see the difference be-
tween the initial concept map and the reconstructed map (e.g., “I was glad to see the
different way to connect the nodes by my friend”). The KB visualization of difference
map also helped them to realize their mistakes (14.9%, e.g., “I realized if I have miscon-
ceptions or incorrect notions”) and made them understand the comprehension of their
partner (8.9%, e.g., “I need to guess and try to understand perspectives of my friend’s

concept map.”). The KB links aided students in detecting alternatives perspectives as
well (25.5%, e.g., “It is interesting to see the variety of my friends’ concepts and discuss-
ing it together.”). Some students reported that they faced difficulties in integrating dif-
ferent perspectives (15%), especially when they had many differences (6.4%). Some
students felt like it was challenging to reach a consensus (12.8%, e.g., “It is difficult to

determine who was the most correct.”).

Discussion

Following the proposed approach, students achieve high-quality group products. A pos-
sible factor contributing to better group outcomes is the interaction during discourse.
The initial study of RKB presents that the pairs in the experimental groups demonstrate
more exploratory talk when they discuss each other’s ideas, compared to the pairs who
were not using the system (Wunnasri et al. 2018a, 2018b). Exploratory talk is a type of
talk in which partners engage in each other’s ideas critically but constructively (Mercer
1996). Students might actively dig for information when they agreed on what the other
party says or offers arguments and look for alternative solutions when they disagree.
Exploratory talk is considered the most educationally relevant type of talk that helps
groups to reason together and increase individual learning gain (Wegerif et al. 1999).

While creating an individual map is a method to express own understanding, the re-
construction activity is a method to understand the partner’s point of view. Ideas ex-
change through the reconstruction of concept map components from a partner’s map,
and the discussion of difference maps could encourage understanding of the partner’s
representation (Wunnasri et al. 2018b). Comprehension of partner representation be-
comes visible. Even though the study of Engelmann and Hesse (2010) shows that the
awareness of other knowledge might not necessarily affect the learning outcomes, it af-
fects the process of knowledge construction to make it more effective because learners
can reach consensus-building faster and no initial exploration is needed (Engelmann
and Hesse 2010). An awareness tool regarding knowledge of the collaborating partner
allows social comparisons and guides activities. Learners approximate and integrate
each other’s perspectives, synthesize their ideas, and jointly try to make sense of a task
(Nastasi and Clements 1992).

The reconstruction does not only assist learners in understanding the partner’s per-
spective but also reveals the similarities degree between a pair’s prior knowledge. The
correlation between the similarity of learners’ individual maps and the number of
matching and excessive links are .5283 and - .5205, respectively. These findings are
consistent with the previous study results suggesting that the similarity of learners’ map
is reflected on their KB visualization (Wunnasri et al. 2018a). Moreover, some students
agree that the reconstruction of the partner’s kit is an interesting activity to find out
the partner’s comprehension (27%). They become aware of the similarities and differ-
ences between their perceptions (25%). They also find new ideas or different represen-
tations from a similar idea (14.9%).

The reconstruction activity also raised conflicts because the students have to review all map
components and estimate the solution of their partners. After reconstruction, the system can
illustrate a difference map to facilitate students’ discussion. The students are then able to de-
tect a discrepancy between their representations. Prior research demonstrates that irregular in-
formation triggers students to actively process and resolve conflicts, which subsequently
Sadita et al. Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2020) 15:19 Page 18 of 22

compensates conceptual change and advancement of understanding (Chan et al. 1997). By
showing a difference map, students may elicit relevant information from the partners, so that
they can discuss to negotiate different understanding. This is a key step to resolve conflicts
among group members. Finally, the creation of a join map is a means to integrate similarities
and differences of individual knowledge and reach a consensus.

The results posit that, following the KB visualization, a clear majority of the students
preserve the matching links, a moderate proportion of them maintain the lacking links,
and more than half of the students preserve the excessive links in the group map with
the portions of 82%, 42%, and 60%, respectively. The map scores gain has a moderate
positive correlation with the number of excessive links. The students acknowledge the
visualization from the KB map when they decompose a group map. Although the stu-
dents keep the same link (relations), most of the linking words considerably differ in all
types of KB links, which revealed that the students do not merely follow others’ ideas,
but also constructively build on the group shared knowledge.

In the KB approach, knowledge is made publicly accountable, and comprehension of
others’ perspectives is visible. Contrary to other approaches that can be only visible in
the utterances (talks), comprehension and misunderstanding of partners’ representation
are not explicitly supported. The RKB is promising due to the reconstruction activity
and the visualization of lacking and excessive links that could stimulate learners’ pro-
gress on solving the task. By facing criticism, learners may be pushed to test multiple
perspectives or to find more and better arguments for their positions (Chan et al.
1997). When building a consensus in a conflict-oriented manner, learners need to iden-
tify specific aspects of their peers’ contributions and modify them or present alterna-
tives. Thus, learners need to operate more closely in the reasoning of their peers when
compared to a simple acceptance of peers’ contributions (Chan et al. 1997). Prior stud-
ies indicate that active pursuit of resolving conflicts is necessary for the construction of
knowledge (Kalishman et al. 2012; Roschelle 1992; Roschelle and Teasley 1995; van
Boxtel et al. 2002). Both the visualization and clarification assist the discovery of dis-
crepancies between individual knowledge representations, which provokes students to
explain their reasoning and allows them to develop their resolution of differences
through elaboration (van Boxtel et al. 2002). Learning effectiveness depends on the ex-
tent to which students share their learning; as a process of knowledge acquisition and
creation through direct interaction (Stoyanova and Kommers 2002).

The current findings show that after following the RKB activities, most dyads can
achieve high-quality group solutions and transfer their individual ideas, which are the rep-
resentative forms of learning effectiveness at the group level as a whole and as an inter-
action between individual students and group achievements as stated by Stoyanova and
Kommers (2002). Moreover, the students have also positively accepted the learning activ-
ities. The assessment of group performance is an important initial stage to identify the ef-
fectiveness of the RKB for collaborative learning. According to Dillenbourg (1999), the
validity of group assessments can be understood in practical terms since the need for col-
laboration among professionals is increasing and any educational institution is required to
improve the students’ performance in collaborative situations. Furthermore, an investiga-
tion of learning effectiveness at the level of individual students and the interaction of
group achievements with the individual post-collaboration outcomes is also interesting to
uncover how the RKB approach affect conceptual change at the individual level.

Limitations of the study and directions for future studies

This study is the first attempt to explore the potential use of the RKB system in a prac-
tical classroom in Indonesia. A single group study is conducted to ensure fairness in a
real classroom context. Future studies may conduct an experimental study in order to
measure the effectiveness of the RKB approach compare to a common collaborative
concept mapping approach with individual externalization and concept map sharing. A
within-subjects study with counterbalancing and group randomization can be a poten-
tial alternative for further research. To evaluate the effects of collaborative activities on
individual knowledge, students would be requested to build post-collaboration maps or
answer a pre- and post-test as parts of the experimental activities in the future. More-
over, the use of RKB in collaborative learning settings is administered in a dyad. The
issue of how to transfer this approach to more than two people would be another sub-
ject of future research.

Most students consider the RKB approach is attractive and stimulating, while the
lowest items are related to perspicuity scale. This may be because the students’ cogni-
tive loads are rather high. It is suggested differentiating the individual and collaborative
phase to reduce the students’ loads. Some students also report several technical issues.
The interface of the RKB system may require some improvements. Further, an analyzer
that shows students’ generated links might be useful to provide information about stu-

dents’ progress for the teacher.

Conclusion

This study investigates the use of RKB approach to support collaborative knowledge
construction, extending previous collaborative concept mapping approaches (de Weerd
et al. 2017; Engelmann and Hesse 2010; Fischer et al. 2002; Gracia-Moreno et al. 2017)
in two ways: by reconstruction of partner’s kit and by the visualization of individual
map differences. The study findings indicate that the combination of these activities
supports learners to achieve high-quality collaborative products as in the previous col-
laborative concept mapping studies with individual externalization and knowledge
awareness tool. The visualization of map differences acts as a guide during discourse
which is reflected from the patterns of modifications from the individual, i.e., initial
and reconstruction maps, to the group maps. Positive attitudes of the students toward
the activities signify the usefulness and attractiveness of the learning activities. The pro-
posed approach provides a means for sharing of individual ideas and discovers the di-
vergence of knowledge that has not been utilized in other studies. Though the results
from this initial study seem promising, to infer the generalizability of the proposed
approach more experiments in different classroom contexts and settings should be

conducted.
