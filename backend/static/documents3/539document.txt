Abstract

With the rapid development of location-based services in the field of mobile network applications, users enjoy the
convenience of location-based services on one side, and they are exposed to the risk of privacy disclosure on the other
side. Attackers may attack based on the semantic of the user's location and user's query location. A few of existing
works on location privacy protection consider to protect the user's location and his query location simultaneously,
while the query location may reflect his requirement. In this paper, based on the existing location privacy protection

framework, we first generate sensitive weight documents based on the user's sensitivity to different location semantics
automatically, then obtain the best collaborative segment for k-anonymity of the user's location by using the
reinforcement learning algorithm, and finally, the bidirectional k-disturbance of the user's location and query location is
performed based on the location semantics in real road network environment. The experiment verifies the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

1 Introduction

In recent years, with the increase of computing power and
storage capacity of mobile computing equipment, mobile
phones, vehicle terminals, and wearable intelligent devices
become more and more popular. At the same time, location-
based services (LBS) are blooming, such as Google Maps,
Bing Maps, Facebook, and Twitter. Users can obtain related
services based on their locations, which can be acquired by
the inner GPS (Global Positioning System) in the mobile
equipment.

When enjoying the convenience of location-based ser-
vice, people are exposed to the risk of privacy disclosure,
which may result in economic and honorary loss and
even live threat. When using LBS, the user sends his
own location information and service request to the lo-
cation provider. Although the location provider claims
that he is trustworthy, if the server data are stolen by the
attacker, even the location provider himself is the at-
tacker, and users’ location information will be leaked.
Based on the location information, the attacker can infer

the user’s identity, behavior, habits, health status, social
relations, and other privacy information.

The existing location privacy framework can be divided
into two categories based on whether the third-party
trusted server is used. In order to reduce the client compu-
tational cost, most works use third-party trusted servers.
However, the third-party trusted server is not absolutely
credible, since it can also become the objective of the at-
tack, thus resulting in information disclosure. Although we
use the existing location privacy service framework, there is
a difference when the service request is sent to ensure that
the user’s real location cannot be uniquely identified.

Existing location privacy protection methods mainly
include k-anonymous, space cloaking, dummy position
generation, and encryption. However, few works on
location privacy protection consider the semantic infor-
mation behind the location of the real road network or
consider protecting the user’s location and his query lo-
cation simultaneously. For example, suppose that a user
searches for “nearby skin hospital” after drawing money
from the bank. Previous work only provides protection
to the user’s location, and not to the user’s query loca-
tion which may reflect the user’s need. If such sensitive

need is obtained by malicious attackers, the user’s priv-
acy will be leaked, so the user’s query location also needs
to be protected.

There are three problems with the existing location priv-
acy protection solutions. First, different users have different
sensitivity weights to different location semantics, while
users’ different preferences are not incorporated into exist-
ing solutions. For example, if John is a doctor, the hospital
is not a sensitive place for him and it is normal that he ap-
pears in the hospital. But if Alice is a supermarket em-
ployee, she does not go to hospital often, so the hospital is
a sensitive place for her. Therefore, each user should obtain
personalized protection due to different location semantics
sensitivity. Second, when k-anonymizing a user, his location
is anonymized with other sections of the road except for
his real road section, but the user’s sensitive location se-
mantics in other sections are not considered. For example,
if Bob is sensitive to location semantics A and B, Bob needs
three segments to achieve k-anonymity. If A and B on the
three selected road segments are more than that on the
other three unselected segments, although the kK-anonymity
requirement is reached, the algorithm is still not satisfactory
since it does not consider the user’s sensitive location se-
mantics on the candidate roads in the anonymity set. Third,
protecting the user’s location is important, but the location
that the user has queried is also important, since the query
location may reflect the user’s living habits, personal health,
or status. For example, Bob inquired about “dermatology
hospitals” near “banks,” and the two locations are sensitive
to Bob, so it is necessary to protect the user’s location and
the query location at the same time.

In order to solve the three problems, in this paper, we
propose a personalized location privacy protection
framework based on location semantics, which consists
of three steps: first, we propose a personalized sensitivity
weight assignment algorithm, by which the location se-
mantics sensitivity preference of the user can be ob-
tained quickly without manual settings; second, in order
to protect the user’s location, we propose a collaborative
road segment matching algorithm using reinforcement
learning, which gets the safest collaborative road seg-
ments for kK-anonymity based on the user’s sensitivity to
location semantics; Third, in order to protect the user’s
query location, we propose a bidirectional location k-dis-
turbance algorithm based on location semantics, which
can k-disturb the user’s location and query target at the
same time, and greatly reduce the privacy leakage caused
by the intersection of anonymity sets when continuous
queries are encountered.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Related work is discussed in Section 2. The prelimin-
aries of this paper are given in Section 3. The pro-
posed approach is illustrated in Section 4. The
experimental results are presented in Section 5. And

finally, the conclusions and future work are given in
Section 6.

2 Related work
The existing work on location privacy protection can be
divided into the following 4 categories:

(1) k-anonymous [1-9]. kK-anonymous is the basis of
many privacy protection methods. For example,
Gruteser and Grunwald [1] proposed the location
k-anonymous, and the main idea is that the
location of the user who sends the service
request cannot be differentiated with other k-1
user's location so that the probability that the
user is identified does not exceed 1/k. Yiu et al.
[2] in the Space Twist program introduced a
trusted third-party server so that users can avoid
sending their own specific location to the loca-
tion provider, which reduces the possibility of lo-
cation information disclosure. In addition, the
introduction of a third-party trusted server can
greatly reduce the client’s computing overhead,
and the user can access to services more quickly.
Mokbel et al. [3] proposed a k-anonymity protec-
tion method, which also needs to introduce a
trusted third party. But the k-anonymity protec-
tion method will produce a k-1 dummy location
of the generalized area to interfere with location
providers so that the possibility of identifying the
user for the location provider cannot be greater
than 1/k. In addition, trusted third-party server
also has a filtering function, which can remove
the dummy location’s request results and return
request service results to the client.

(2) Space cloaking [10-17]. Space cloaking is a popular
location privacy protection method. Chow et al.
[10] proposed the Casper cloak algorithm, which
uses the quadtree data structure to divide the
spatial structure into H layers, each with
information about the entire spatial structure.
The algorithm allows the user to customize the
minimum anonymous area A, jn and generalize
the user’s location into the area. Sun et al. [11]
designed a geolocation tag to distinguish sensitive
locations and common locations in order to
minimize the response time of the requesting
service and to protect the user’s location privacy
through spatial stealth technology.

(3) Dummy position generation [18-22]. Dummy
position generation method is commonly used.
Kido et al. [18, 19] first proposed a dummy
location method in the study of location privacy
protection. Guo et al. [20] realized trajectory
privacy protection by using the dynamic
Kuang et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

pseudonym change mechanism and user-
controllable dummy location generation mechan-
ism combining with a geometric transformation
algorithm.

(4) Encryption [23-29]. Instead of using a third-party
trusted server, the method directly sends encrypted
requests to the server and then decrypts in the client.
Although the security of this method is very high, the
computational cost is huge, the deployment is com-
plex, and the algorithm needs to be optimized.
Khoshgozaran et al. [23] proposed a Hilbert curve
based on the encryption method. The user’s location
and points of interest are transferred from the two-
dimensional coordinates to one-dimensional encryp-
tion space, and one-dimensional encryption space,
transferred through two different parameters of the
Hilbert curve, still maintains the proximity in two-
dimensional space, so that k-nearest neighbor query
and range query can also be performed in one-
dimensional encrypted space. PIR (private informa-
tion retrieval) [24] method replaces the homo-
morphic comparison step with an unconscious
transfer to achieve a more secure solution. The PIR
method has the advantage of high privacy protection
security, but the client computing is very large. Lu
et al. [25] proposed PLAM privacy protection frame-
work, which uses homomorphic encryption technol-
ogy to protect the user’s privacy, and cannot only
achieve satisfactory privacy requirements, but also re-
sist most of the external attacks.

Most of the existing work on location privacy protec-
tion do not take the real road network situation, the se-
mantic meaning of locations and _ user’s_ sensitive
preference to location semantics into account. More and
more researchers begin to devote themselves to privacy
protection based on _ location semantics [30-42].
Damiani et al. [30] considered the semantic information
of the user’s location and introduce a framework that in-
cludes semantic perception ambiguities to generate cha-
otic space. Xiao et al. [31] proposed p-sensitivity
mechanism. The mechanism uses PE-Tree to divide the
query into sensitive and non-sensitive categories, but the
query is not protected. If the query location is sensitive
to the location semantics, it is possible to disclose the
user’s privacy. The paper [32, 33] proposed the PROBE
framework, in which the user can edit the privacy docu-
ment according to his own sensitivity to the location se-
mantics, but the operation is too complicated. Xue et al.
[34] protected the user’s location privacy by using the
generated semantic position. In order to improve the k-
anonymous protection efforts, it is necessary to ensure
that each query is at least related to k-different semantic
positions.

In summary, the main contributions of our paper are
as follows:

(1) We protect the security of the user’s location and
the query location simultaneously and conduct the
bidirectional k-disturbance based on the semantics
of the user’s location and query location.

(2) User’s sensitivity preference to different location
semantics can be obtained more conveniently
without manual settings.

(3) According to the users’ sensitivity preference to
different locations, the collaborative road segments
with the highest security for users can be matched
to meet the demand for k-anonymity.

3 Background and problem definition

3.1 Location service framework and workflow

As shown in Fig. 1, this paper uses a semi-trusted anonym-
ous server location service framework [43]. The framework
workflow is shown in Fig. 1 marked with Arabic numerals
1 to 4. The first step, two-way concealment: the client will
form the k-anonymous user’s location and the query re-
quest location information and submit to the intermediate
server together with sensitive location semantics informa-
tion selected by the user; the second step, the query request:
the intermediate server will submit the kK-anonymous loca-
tion information and query information to the location ser-
vice provider; the third step, the intermediate server
receives the return result set of the location service pro-
vider, and the intermediate server does comprehensive
scoring combining the result set, the user’s sensitive loca-
tion semantics information, and the distance between the
user and the query result, and then, the intermediate server
can form a query target rank; the fourth step, the client re-
ceives the data processed by the intermediate server, filters
out the redundant data, and finally sends the request result
to choose corresponding to the user’s location.

3.2 Location semantic information

Definition 1: location semantics. It represents the true
meaning behind the location. All the location semantics
is divided into n classes, TP = {tp,, tpo, tp3,...,tp,}, TP is
all types of position semantics.

Definition 2: road information. The research object of
this paper is the location semantic information in the real
road network, and road; (rid, Setag,Setsem) is used to denote
the road information, where rid denotes the road number,
Set,g; denotes the number set of adjacent road, and Setsem
denotes the collection of all location semantic on the road.

Definition 3: user location. We use Upos,(rid,id,x,y,tp)
to denote the user’s location, where rid is the road num-
ber, id is the user identifier, x is the longitude of the
user’s location, y is the latitude of the user, and tp is the
type of the user’s location semantics.

Definition 4: location semantics sensitive set. Users
will set up sensitive collections based on their sensitive lo-
cation semantics before using the service for the first time.
We use SEN,,={(sentp, level), (sentp, evel), (sentp, level) ,...,
(sentp, level)}to represent the user’s sensitive location se-
mantics set, sentp, represents different types of user's sen-
sitive location semantics,

Definition 5: collaboration sections. Use Cr; to indicate
the ith collaborative segment required by the user’s
demand for k-anonymity. Cr... represents a collection
of all the collaborative segments required by the user.

Definition 6: privacy requirements. The user’s privacy
requirements can be represented as PPD (privacy protec-
tion demand) = ( SEN,,k). SEN, denotes the user’s own
sensitive location semantics collection, and k denotes
that the process of k-disturbance of the user’s location
and the query location needs to be done respectively.

3.3 Problem definition

The purpose of this paper is to solve the user’s location se-
curity and user’s query security. On this basis, in order to
make users get the service of high privacy security and
service quality, in the background of real road network,
taking the user’s location semantics sensitivity and the dis-
tance between the user and the query location into com-
prehensive consideration, give a comprehensive rank,
which provides the user with reference basis to choose.

In this paper, we make the following assumptions on the
attack: (1) the attacker has the map information, the location
semantics information on each road section; (2) the attacker
has the user's location information and the user’s query infor-
mation; (3) the attacker has the id identifier information of
each inquirer.

4 Method

4.1 Personalized sensitivity weight assignment algorithm
4.1.1 Definition 7 Location semantic sensitive weights
Although each user has a location semantic privacy collec-
tion SEN,, that can know what type of location semantic the

 

user is sensitive to, but cannot reflect the user’s sensitivity to
different location semantics. So we design a personalized sen-
sitivity weight partitioning algorithm for different users. We
appoint that the value of the sum of the user’s location se-
mantic sensitive weight is 1, expressed as

Wip, + Wtp, + Wip, +. + We, = 1 (1)

As shown in Fig. 2, we design a semi-automated method
of obtaining user-sensitive weights. When the user first uses
the service, he needs to drag the user-sensitive location se-
mantics from all location semantics columns to the sensitive
location semantics column. Sensitivity columns 1 to 3 indi-
cate the degree of sensitivity. We will divide location seman-
tic sensitivity into three levels, recorded as level 1, level 2,
and level 3, and each level has the same location semantics
sensitivity and the assigned sensitive weight, each sensitivity
of the position semantics in level 1 > level 2 > level 3. The
weight of the location semantics sensitivity that has not been
dragged into the sensitive location semantics column is 0.
With the information, the middle of the server can automat-
ically figure out the user’s location semantic sensitive weight
so that users do not need to fill in the privacy documents,
which makes it faster to access to the user’s location seman-
tic sensitivity and increases the user experience of service.

If the amount of sensitive location semantics in level 1
is 1, in level 2 is nz, and in level 3 is nz. Because the lo-
cation semantics sensitivity in each level is the same,
marking it as w; for level 1 is w,, for level 2 is wz, and
for level 3 is w3. Based on the above information and
formula (1), we can deduce the following formula:

Ny - Wy +2 + Wo +n3°-w3= 1 (2)

We already know each sensitivity of the position se-
mantics in level 1 > level 2 > level 3, so we can deduce
the following formula:

Wi > W2 > W3 (3)

Setting up (1) and (2) simultaneously, we can get the
region of solution to wy, w2,and w3, calling the location
semantic sensitive weight FR (feasible domain). Finally,

4.2 Cooperative segment matching algorithm

As shown in Fig. 3, the location semantics marked as
red in the figure are user-sensitive semantic information,
and the semantic information marked as black is non-

 

sensitive semantic information. In the picture, the user’s
location is “Supermarket,” and R, is the user’s location
road. In order to protect the user’s query location, we
use the classic location disturbance protection mechan-
ism. The core idea is to select an area on the user’s loca-
tion, which includes the location of the user and the
other k-1 users, to confound the user’s true location. In
this paper, we discuss semantic-based location privacy
protection, so the difference from the existing method is
that we choose the k-1 class location with the user’s lo-
cation to confound according to the different type of se-
mantics of the user’s location. For example, if the user
selects k = 3, the other two types of locations where the
user is located are preferred to meet the location k-dis-
turbance requirement.

If the chosen k is greater than the category of the
location semantics contained in the road segment, the
user’s location road and the adjacent section are used
to complete the user’s k-anonymous request together.
For example, the user selects k = 8, while the user’s
location road has five types of location semantics
which cannot meet the user’s needs. We can obtain
adjacent sections collection Set,g; of the user’s loca-
tion road from road,(rid,Setag;,TP). If a random sec-
tion is selected from Seta; as a collaborative section,
a path with higher semantic sensitivity may be
chosen, which exposes the user’s sensitive location
with a high probability and increases the risk of user
privacy disclosure. Therefore, the ability to accurately
and intelligently select low-sensitivity roads as a col-
laborative link is critical to the privacy of users.

The process of finding a collaborative segment can be
seen as an intensive learning process that continuously
adds collaborative segments to meet the user’s k-ano-
nymity requirements. The advantage of intensive learn-
ing is that there is no “supervised” signal and only has
the “reward” signal. The whole process of finding a col-
laborative road segment is independently performed by a
computer, the process has a certain degree of random-
ness, and the higher the randomness of anonymity, the
higher the security. In this learning process, the two
main bodies of “Agent” and “Environment” are included;
“Agent” is a learner and a decision-maker and achieves
goals by interacting with the environment [44], and the
interaction process is shown in Fig. 4: “Agent” makes ac-
tion A, based on the current state S,, and “Environment”
responds to get the state S,,, and the reward R,,, at
the next moment, in which the state S and the reward R
at the same moment appear in pairs, and the ultimate

goal is to maximize the sum of the rewards Sno R,. In
the decision-making process of obtaining the sum of the

maximum rewards, the “brain” that leads the dominant
process to be better is the Q table [45, 46], and the value
in the Q table represents the return value of performing
an action in a specific state, and “Agent” through continu-
ous updating and looking up the table to find the execution
action with the highest current return. The R matrix is
similar to the Q table, it represents the return value of the
“Agent” to each state, and the main purpose of updating
the Q matrix is to provide data so that the “Agent” can find
the optimal execution action in the R matrix. The update
of the Q value can be defined as follow:

Q(s,a) = ¥, Reals, 4) + Yo + Rua (sa) +A-+ max{Q(s,a)}
(4)

where s represents the current state, a@ represents the
current action, s represents the next state that is not de-
termined, and a represents the next action that is not
determined. Q(s,a) represents the expected maximum

benefit that can be obtained by taking action a under
state s. y1, Y2, respectively, represent the greedy factors
of the return values R,,(s,a) and Ria(S ,a@) represents
the return value immediately obtained by the current ac-
tion, Rna(S »@ )represents the next action return value,
and s, a, respectively, represent the next determined
state and action. A represents the greedy factor of the
maximum value of Q(s,a), and max{Q(s,a)} represents
the expected maximum benefit that can be obtained by
taking action a in state s.

By using the personalized sensitivity weight division al-
gorithm in Section 4.1 to derive the position semantic
sensitivity weight feasible domain, we can get the num-
ber of semantic sensitivity levels of each location of the
user, then we mark 1 =3, N2=5, and n3=10, and get the
feasible solution w,=0.1, w2=0.08, and w3=0.03 through
formulas (2) and (3). Because the higher the sensitivity
weight, the more sensitive the user is to the semantics of
the location, which means that the reward value is in-
versely proportional to the sensitivity weight, we use Rj,
R», and R3 to represent the return values of the three
sensitive levels, and find R,=0.03, R,=0.08, and R3=0.1.
We use an example to explain how to find the maximum
value action by updating Q table, and the initial value of
Q table is 0. Taking the location semantic road network
of Fig. 3 as an example, the sum of the return values of
all position semantics of each road is taken as the return
value of the road segment. R table is shown in Fig. 5a,
the first row of the R table represents the name of the
road segment, and the value in the table represents the
return value of one road matching to another road,
where the value of - 1 indicates that the two road seg-
ments cannot communicate. The Q table is the same as
the R table, the first row column indicates the name of

 

the road segment, and the value in the matrix indicates
the expected maximum benefit that can be obtained by
taking the action a under the state s. Q table is shown in
Fig. 5b-—d, where different epochs represent different
training rounds, Fig. 5b shows the matrix obtained after
a round of training in the initial state where Q table is
all 0 when epochs = 1, Fig. 5 c and d are the matrices
obtained by training with epochs = 10 and epochs = 100,
respectively, and the values in the Q table obtained by
training epochs = 10 and epochs = 100 are very close,
which indicate that Q table has converged when epochs
= 10.

If the required k value of kK-anonymity is 15, the user’s
location semantic on the road segment R, of Fig. 3.
There are only six location semantics on Rj, which can-
not meet the requirement of k = 15, and need other road
segments to cooperate to complete the k-anonymous
task. Sometimes, the k value will be larger, and then
more road segments are needed as collaborative road
segments. The collaborative road segment can be found
through the updated Q table, where the user can be lo-
cated as R, and corresponding to the first row or col-
umn in the Q table (randomly take the rows in the
table). The largest value in the first row is Q (1, 4), so
we choose R, as the collaborative segment of R,, but the
requirement of k = 15 cannot be satisfied at this time,
we need to continue to match R,’s collaborative seg-
ments, and the largest value in the fourth row is Q (4,
1), but R, is already a collaborative road segment, we
need to select the section with the largest remaining Q
value. At this time, the largest value is Q (4, 2) and k =
18 satisfies the anonymity requirement of k = 15, and
the collection of collaborative segments is R,, Ry, and Ro.
If the user-required k is larger, more road segments can

3.The first case: Bob searches nearby “Restaurant” in
the “Supermarket,” so the client chooses “Supermar-
ket,” Bob searches nearby “Restaurant’s” location k-
anonymity; the second case: if Bob does not move to
another location semantics range and searches for the
nearby “Bar,” the k-anonymous result is still “Super-
market, Café, Hardware store”; the third case: if Bob
moves to “Hotel,” k-anonymous results will change,
and the client will choose “Hotel, Café, Supermarket”
to do the user’s location k-anonymity. Using k-dis-
turbance for user’s location algorithm can solve the
intersection problem in continuous queries.

4.3.2 k-disturbance for user’s query objectives algorithm

This paper proposes a k-disturbance for user’s query ob-
jectives algorithm. The content of the algorithm is that
the client randomly selects k-1 class location semantics
and the location semantics of user queries from user’s
location road or adjacent sections to meet the k-an-
onymous request. k-disturbance for user’s query objec-
tives algorithm also needs to solve the intersection
problem in the continuous query. If the query location
semantics of the client does not change in a continuous
query, the k class location semantics of the first query
target location k-anonymity is still used; but if the query

 

location semantics is changed into new, a new k class
query targets’ location semantics is selected to do the lo-
cation k-anonymity. When the user’s location semantics
change, a new k class query targets’ location semantics
also needs to be re-selected to do the location k-ano-
nymity. Because if the user location changes, the user
may not be in the original section or the original k-1 lo-
cation semantics used to meet k-anonymous require-
ments may not be in the user’s section and adjacent
sections. For example, set k = 3, the first case: Bob
searches nearby “Bank” in the “Supermarket,” so “Bank”
will be changed into k-anonymous “Bank, Bar, Hotel”
after k-anonymity; the second case: if the user still re-
quests for nearby “Bank” query services in the “Super-
market,” k-anonymous result is still “Bank, Bar, Hotel”;
the third case: if Bob in the “Supermarket” requests for
the nearby “Bar” query services, two new location se-
mantics will be re-selected to meet k-anonymous re-
quirements, and the possible results can be “Bar, Hotel,
Pastry shop”.

The set of road segments used by k-disturbance for
user's location algorithm or k- disturbance for user’s
query objectives algorithm when anonymizing the user’s
location is provided by cooperative segment matching al-
gorithm. We combines k-disturbance for user’s location
algorithm and k-disturbance for user’s query objectives
algorithm comprehensively as Bidirectional location k-
disturbance algorithm, and Bidirectional location  k-
disturbance algorithm is as follows:

5 Experiment and results
5.1 Experimental setting
In this paper, the road network data in Oldenburg,
Germany [47] includes a total of 6105 roads, which are
composed of 7035 vertices. The vertical and horizontal co-
ordinates of these vertices are between 0 and 30,000 and
between O and 25,000, respectively. The road network
generated from the roads and vertices in the original data
is shown in Fig. 7. The research content of this paper is
mainly based on the location semantic information in the
road network, which needs to generate the location se-
mantic information according to the original data set. The
experimental setting randomly generates 3 to 10 kinds of
location semantic information on each road in the original
road network and generates a road network with semantic
information as shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 9, The
generator generates 10 different location semantics that
randomly are distributed in the original road network.
The experiments in this paper include the required
time to anonymize of the proposed BLk-disturbance al-
gorithm, the needed roads to complete anonymity ac-
cording to the size of user-selected k of BLk-disturbance
algorithm, anonymous success rate of anonymous
method based on location semantics compared with ran-
dom dummy location generation, and the quality of ser-
vice comparison between BLk-disturbance algorithm and
random dummy position generation algorithm. The ex-
perimental code for this article is written in Python and
runs on Windows10 operating system configured with
Intel (R) Core i5-4590 CPU, 8GB, 64-bit.

5.2 The required time to anonymize of BLk-disturbance
algorithm

Bidirectional location k-disturbance includes two parts:
k-disturbance algorithm for the user’s location and k-dis-
turbance for query targets, where the time spent on the
user’s location using the user’s location k-disturbance

algorithm is shown in Fig. 10a. The first, second, and
third cases correspond to the user location status when
three kinds of users of the user’s location k-disturbance
algorithm inquiry in chapter 4.2. In order to compare
the time consumption corresponding to different k
values selected by the user in three cases, 10,000

Kuang et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

experiments were carried out in each of the three cases,
and the time consumed in each case was the average of
10,000 experimental results. Anonymous time of the first
and third cases is more similar, because the first and
third cases need to generate kK dummy positions and use
the same mechanism, and the time spent was only linked
with the size of k. However, in the second case, only the
dummy position generated in the first case is reused, so
the time consumption is almost zero.

The time spent on user’s query target anonymity
using the user’s query target k-disturbance algorithm
is shown in Fig. 10b. Similarly, with the experiment
above, the first, second, and third cases correspond to
the three cases of the user’s query target k-disturb-
ance algorithm in chapter 4.2. The time consumption
of the first and second cases is similar because the
first and second cases need to generate k dummy po-
sitions and use the same mechanism, and the time
consumption was only linked with the size of k. How-
ever, in the third case, only the dummy position gen-
erated in the first case is reused, so the time
consumption is almost zero.

5.3 The needed roads to complete anonymity of BLk-
disturbance algorithm

In the experiment, 2 to 10 kinds of location semantic
information are randomly distributed on each road.
The number of roads needed to complete anonymity

(2020) 2020:1 Page 13 of 16

varies with the k value. As shown in Fig. 11, the
matchbox bar represents the statistical value of the
number of roads that the user needs to complete
anonymity under the different k-value requirements.
As the value of k increases, the number of roads re-
quired to complete anonymity increases. Because the
larger the value of k, the more semantic information
on the road is needed. However, the semantic distri-
bution of the location of each road does not necessar-
ily meet the user’s demand for k, so cooperation with
a number of roads is needed to complete the ano-
nymity of user’s location and query target. The solid
black line in Fig. 11 represents the number of roads
to anonymize for different values of k, which is ob-
tained by rounding up the statistics number of re-
quired road and more intuitively represents the
relationship between k and anonymity required the
number of required roads to anonymize in real
meaning.

5.4 Anonymous success rate of anonymous method
based on location semantics compared with random
dummy location generation

Anonymous success rate can evaluate an anonymous al-
gorithm. In the real road network, each location seman-
tic information has the geographic location range.
However, the anonymous algorithm based on random
dummy location generation does not consider the

geographic location range, and k dummy positions are
generated randomly in a given anonymous area. And if
used in road network, two or more dummy locations
will distribute within the geographic range of the same
location semantics. If an attacker attacks based on loca-
tion semantics information, user’s kK-anonymous require-
ment cannot be met, or anonymity fails. As shown in
Fig. 12, the proposed method based on location semantic
information anonymity has a 100% success rate, but the
anonymity success rate of anonymous method based on
random dummy location generation decreases with the
increase of k value. When k is set as 9 or 10, the success
rate is essentially zero, which greatly increases the prob-
ability of an attacker’s successful attack.

5.5 The quality of service comparison between BLk-
disturbance algorithm and random dummy position
generation algorithm

In order to compare the quality of service finally ob-
tained by the BLk-disturbance algorithm and the ran-
dom dummy position generation algorithm, we set up a
comparative experiment. Regardless of the final selection
of several roads to complete the anonymity, the final cal-
culation of the distance from the user to the target is
only related to the location of the user and has nothing
to do with the other sections that jointly accomplish the
k-disturbance. In order to evaluate the quality of service
that the algorithm ultimately enables the user to obtain,
10,000 experiments were conducted in which the quality
of service was replaced by the relative distance of the
user-selected target. The relative distance is the distance
between the dummy location and the user’s location.
The smaller the relative distance is, the better the service
quality is. As shown in Fig. 13, the more semantic infor-
mation of the location there are on the road where the
user is located, the smaller the relative distance differ-
ence is and the more accurate the quality of service ob-
tained is. As can be seen in Fig. 13, the quality of service
obtained by the random dummy position generation al-
gorithm is inversely proportional to k, but the quality of
service using dummy position generated by BLk-disturb-
ance is superior to the random dummy position gener-
ation algorithm when the user selects the same k value.

6 Discussion

The above analysis is based on location privacy protec-
tion in areas with rich location semantic information. In
fact, if the location semantic information is sparse, it is
not easy to reach the requirement of user k-anonymous,
and the purpose of location privacy protection is also
not achieved. The research on location privacy protec-
tion in areas with sparse location semantic information
is one of the directions that are worthy of further
research.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a personalized location privacy
protection framework based on location semantics. We
first obtain the user’s sensitivity preference of various lo-
cation semantics without trivial manual settings. In
order to provide better privacy protection and service
quality for users, we then propose cooperative road sec-
tions matching the algorithm which uses the idea of
reinforcement learning and short-time learning, which
can get the cooperative road sections for kK-anonymity
based on user’s sensitivity preference. Then we propose
a bidirectional location k-disturbance algorithm, which
disturb the user’s location and the query location by
using the candidate set of road segments. In the future
work, we will consider the issue of location privacy pro-
tection for more complex inbound queries in bidirec-
tional road networks.
