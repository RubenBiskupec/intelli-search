Longitudinal spatial dataset on
travel times and distances by
different travel modes in Helsinki
Region

Henrikki Tenkanen@*?:?™ & Tuuli Toivonen@*?

Comparable data on spatial accessibility by different travel modes are frequently needed to understand
how city regions function. Here, we present a spatial dataset called the Helsinki Region Travel Time
Matrix that has been calculated for 2013, 2015 and 2018. This longitudinal dataset contains travel time
and distance information between all 250 metres statistical grid cell centroids in the Capital Region

of Helsinki, Finland. The dataset is multimodal and multitemporal by nature: all typical transport
modes (walking, cycling, public transport, and private car) are included and calculated separately

: for the morning rush hour and midday for an average working day. We followed a so-called door-
- to-door principle, making the information between travel modes comparable. The analyses were

based primarily on open data sources, and all the tools that were used to produce the data are openly
available. The matrices form a time-series that can reveal the accessibility conditions within the city
and allow comparisons of the changes in accessibility in the region, which support spatial planning and
decision-making.

Background & Summary

Spatial mobility between locations is an inherent part of urban systems. Understanding travel times and travel
distances between places is a key to analyse the city structure from a functional perspective. Travel times and
distances also form the basis for measures of accessibility, which are often used as conceptual and methodo-
logical tools in spatial planning processes and decision making. Accessibility links e.g. landuse, transportation,
socio-economic factors together in an easily understandable manner. Hence, accessibility assessment has become
one of the “basic” analyses and part of the decision making process when planning new infrastructure or services
in cities. Accessibility, which can be defined as “the potential for interaction”', can be measured in various ways
depending on the approach and the question at hand (e.g.*-*). However, time and metric distance are by far the
most widely used measures of accessibility.

The ability to measure travel times and distances has evolved enormously during the past two decades. Simple
Euclidian metrics have been replaced by advanced network-based measures” that aim at modelling the distances
and travel times for different modes of transportation’ as realistically as possible. Various advanced routing algo-
rithms® have been developed to help citizens to navigate through the cities, or to gain travel time information for
different travel modes. However, using the same algorithms in broad-scale analyses requires high computational
capacity due to the complexity of multimodal and multitemporal travel time estimation. Hence, planners and
decision makers interested in general spatial patterns have often needed to rely on more simplistic distance meas-
ures’, such as atemporal Euclidian distances*’, or considering only a single travel mode’*'’.

Openness in data sharing has increased enourmously in the past decade or so’. Transportation data have been
at the forefront of the openness and data are widely available from many parts of the world, including online data
portals such as transitfeeds.com and transit.land, that provide public transport data from hundreds of cities across
the world. These advances in data sharing has made it possible to develop sophisticated tools that support analysis
of transportation and travel times in order to understand how dynamic cities function®. Increasing computational

capacity (such as cloud computing and high performance computing) have made it possible to analyse data with
higher accuracy and to a broader extent than ever before.

Stemming from these technical advancements and information needs, we introduce an open dataset called the
Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix, and a set of open source tools that were used to compute it. The dataset pro-
vides longitudinal spatial information for analysing accessibility in Helsinki Capital Region, comparably during
2013, 2015 and 2018. The Helsinki Capital Region (referred to as Helsinki Region in the rest of the manuscript)
provides an interesting setting for transportation research, because many large-scale transportation infrastructure
projects have been completed during the past five years, and the city region is growing rapidly. The data described
provide windows to regional-scale accessibility realities with all common travel modes (public transport, car, bike,
walking) in an easily-accessible format that can be linked with various other spatial datasets. The easy availability
and usability of this information has led to the data being widely used by cities, services and businesses in the
study area.

In this article, we have documented and shared the methodologies, tools and approaches that were used to
produce the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix following the principles of open science. We provide detailed
description of the dataset and its production, data quality assessment of the data against other data sources, and
present examples of how the data can be used to provide insights into the urban dynamics and regional accessi-
bility patterns. As the concept of accessibility naturally binds together questions of land use, transportation, econ-
omy and so on, the given dataset can deliver relevant information to support decision making in the study area.

Methods

Being able to compare travel modes to each other (realistically) at different hours of the day requires following
a so-called door-to-door approach (Fig. 1). This means that travel time and distance are calculated comparably
between travel modes by considering every step of a journey when calculating a route between origins and desti-
nations. These steps include walking legs and transfers from one vehicle to another and the time it takes to search
for a parking space or lock/unlock one’s bike. Considering these steps makes the travel times between transport
modes more comparable with each other, and realistic measures of accessibility can be provided.

A variety of input datasets (Table 1) and methods were used to capture and model accessibility for different
travel modes in a dynamic manner at different hours of the day. Figure 2 represents a generic workflow for pro-
ducing the data. Specific preprocessing steps were applied for private car and cycling analyses to improve incorpo-
ration of the spatio-temporal dynamics of travel. After the initial pre-processing step, dedicated graphs were built
for different travel modes that are required to calculate the shortest path routes between locations in the study
area. Finally, the results were parsed and harmonized into a systematically formatted matrix, and the data quality
was assessed against other data sources. The next sections provide further details about the analytical approaches
used for each travel mode. Details on how to reproduce the data can be found at helsinkimatrix.github.io includ-
ing processing codes and source data.

Travel time calculations. Travel time and distance calculations were done separately for each travel mode:
public transport, private car, cycling and walking. Furthermore, the calculations were conducted separately for
the morning rush hour (08:00-09:00) and midday (12:00-13:00) times, to be able to understand the dynamism
of the transport system due to changes in timetables and congestion levels on the roads. The centroids of the
statistical grid cells (Fig. 3) were used as origin and destination points for the calculations, covering the cities of
Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen. The statistical grid (helsinkimatrix.github.io/grid) was originally cre-
ated by Statistics Finland and the Finnish Environmental Institute (FEI), and it has the ETRS89/ETRS-TM35FIN
projection. Hence, the data can be directly used with statistical data obtained from these institutions.

Public transport. A dedicated tool called MetropAccess-Reititin (helsinkimatrix.github.io/reititin) was
developed for public transport routings. As input data, MetropAccess-Reititin uses Kalkati.net XML data" that is
a specific data format used by Helsinki Region Transport for publishing public transport schedules, stops, routes
etc. OpenStreetMap data were used for walking paths including areal features such as squares and plazas, and the

data were obtained from Geofabrik’’ in Protobuf format. MetropAccess-Reititin is written in JavaScript and it
uses a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm that considers transit timetable information when finding the optimal public
transport route between given origin and destination locations (see’® for details). MetropAccess-Reititin is openly
available from helsinkimatrix.github.io/reititin.

The tool considers the entire travel chains (following the door-to-door approach) from the origin to the des-
tination (see also Fig. 1):

¢ possible waiting at home before leaving
e walking from home to the transit stop

¢ waiting at the transit stop

e travel time to next transit stop

e transport mode change

e travel time to next transit stop

e walking to the destination

When routing, the tool first searches for the closest street edge from the origin (based on Euclidian distance).
Following the network, it then finds 3-5 closest public transport stops, and considers all available transit options
from those stops to find the fastest route between the given origin and destination points (for the given departure
time). If the origin and destination are close to each other, the tool uses walking as the fastest route (whenever
walking is faster than taking any of the public transport options). Walking speed was determined as 70 metres
per minute. The tool stores detailed information about all steps of the journey that makes it possible to derive
information about the exact distances for each travel mode. This makes it possible for example to calculate the
CO, emissions produced when using transit (see e.g.'”'®).

For the travel time calculations, we obtained pareto optimal routes (due to varying departure times), by using
ten departure times within the calculation hour using the so called Golomb ruler (departure minutes: 0, 1, 6, 10,
23, 26, 34, 41, 53, 55). The Golomb ruler makes it possible to gain maximal representation of departure times
within one hour. The fastest route from these calculations is selected for the final travel time matrix. The travel
times were calculated separately for the morning rush hour and midday on a typical work day using the effective
schedules for those hours and days (see Table 2). Detailed documentation and instructions how to reproduce the
public transport travel times/distances can be found at helsinkimatrix.github.io/pt_analyses.

Private car. For private car analyses, we first developed a dedicated intersection delay model (see! for details)
to generalise and associate the effect of congestion for the whole street network. In the model, we used GPS data
from floating car measurements to understand how much congestion reduces driving speed at different parts of
the study area (at different times). The deceleration effect of congestion is associated into the network by applying
intersection penalties for different road classes and intersections. Hence, e.g. ramps at motorways have different
intersection penalties compared to intersections affected by traffic lights on local main streets. By running the
network through the intersection delay model, each road segment is given a different drive through times at
different times of the day (rush hour, midday, whole day average, and speed limit based “freeflow” drive through
times). The floating car measurements were collected by Helsinki Region Transport and the City of Helsinki.
Preprocessed car network can be downloaded from helsinkimatrix.github.io/car_network.

When running the analyses with the modified street network, we followed the door-to-door approach, which
includes:

e walking time from the real origin to the nearest network location (based on Euclidean distance)

e average walking time from the origin to the parking lot

e travel time from parking lot to destination

e average time for searching a parking lot

e walking time from parking lot to nearest network location of the destination

e walking time from network location to the real destination (based on Euclidean distance) See also Fig. 1.

For considering the time that it takes to walk to the car from home, we used values based on previous research
conducted in Finnish city regions*®”'. The distance was set as 180 metres (~2.5 minutes) in the city centre areas of
Helsinki, and 130 metres in other areas (~2 minutes). The time that it takes to find a parking lot, was also based on
previous literature*’, and it was specified as 0.42 minutes across the study area. Calculations were done separately
for two times of the day following rush hour (08:00-09:00) and midday (12:00-13:00) traffic conditions.

The calculations for 2018 were done with a dedicated open source tool called Door-to-door Routing Analyst
(DORA) that was developed on top of PostGIS database v.2.3.3 (PostGIS community, 2019). DORA (helsinkima-
trix.github.io/dora) is an open source multimodal routing tool that uses door-to-door approach when retrieving
travel times between multiple origins and destinations. It can be used to route car, cycling and walking routes and
is able to read any road network setup in a database with the pgRouting v2.3.2 (pgRouting community, 2019)
extension. Detailed documentation for reproducing the data can be found at helsinkimatrix.github.io/car_anal-
yses. Car routing for 2013 and 2015 was conducted with the ArcGIS v.10.1 (Environment Systems Research
Institute, 2012) Network Analyst tool using a dedicated toolbox developed for the purpose. The ArcGIS toolbox

(requires ArcGIS -software) is openly available at helsinkimatrix.github.io/md-tool. We ensured that the DORA
and ArcGIS routing tools produced similar results, making the datasets between the years comparable; see hel-
sinkimatrix.github.io/dora_validation for further details.

Cycling. For cycling analyses, we built a customized routing network called MetropAccess-CyclingNetwork
by utilising GPS data from the Strava sport tracker application from 2016. The Strava dataset is based on data
from 5223 unique users. We first linked the GPS points to the closest streets by using customised map matching
techniques**”’. We then identified the roads that are most commonly used by cyclists and calculated user-based
cycling speeds for different road segments. Finally, we aggregated this information into an average travel speed
per segment. See’*”? for details on how the Strava data was processed.

Since the cycling speed is heavily influenced by personal characteristics of the cyclist (e.g. gender, fitness, age,
etc.), the cycling speed we identified was not used directly. Instead, we associated each road segment with infor-
mation about how much faster or slower the cyclists typically ride at a given road segment compared to the total
average travel speed across the network according the Strava data. For instance, segment A is ridden 10 percent
faster than on average, and along segment B the speeds are typically 5 percent slower than the baseline average
speed.

Once the speed profiles were linked to road segments, we calculated ride through times by using the average
cycling speed (19 km/h) of Strava sport tracker users as the reference value for “fast cyclist”. We also calculated

separate ride through times for “slow cyclist’, in which we used the average cycling speed of a city bike system
users (12 km/h). The average travel speed for city cyclists is based on data from a highly popular bicycle shar-
ing system (BSS) in Helsinki. The data contains information about the origin and destination bike station, as
well as distance travelled and the time it took. This information was used to calculate the typical travel speed
of city cyclists. We also included extra time (1 minute) for unlocking and locking the bike, in order to follow
the door-to-door principle. The unlocking/locking time is a naive measure, as it is the same for every location.
However, because of this, it is easy to modify the time if needed, or if more accurate information is available.
Due to privacy reasons and our licensing agreement with Strava, we cannot publicly share the raw Strava data.
However, the preprocessed cycling network that contains segment wise travel speeds based on Strava data can
be downloaded from helsinkimatrix.github.io/bike_network. The Python scripts that were used to produce the
cycling network can be found at helsinkimatrix.github.io/bike_preprocess. Documentation for reproducing the
cycling travel times and distances with DORA routing tool is available at helsinkimatrix.github.io/bike_analyses.

Walking. The walking routes were calculated using the MetropAccess-Reititin by disabling all motorised
transport modes in the calculation. Thus, all routes are based on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) network obtained
from’ at the time of the analysis. OSM is a good data source for estimating pedestrian travel times especially in
urban areas”’, as the data contain paths that are not available in the national road network (which is specifically
targeted at car drivers). We used a static walking speed of 70 metres per minute (4.2 kilometres per hour) that is
also used by public transport journey planner in Helsinki Region (reittiopas.hsl.fi). The same walking speed was
applied also for the walking legs in the public transport calculations. Further details on how to reproduce the data
for walking can be found at helsinkimatrix.github.io/walk_analyses.

Data Records

The Helsinki Region travel time matrix is a multidimensional dataset that provides information about accessi-
bility from multiple angles. Figure 4 illustrates these dimensions using a data cube representation. The dataset
for each year is fundamentally a 13231-ordered tensor covering accessibility matrices for 13 231 statistical grid
cells for 2013, 2015 and 2018. The data” can be download from Zenodo, an open data repository maintained by
CERN.

Each matrix contains accessibility information (travel times and distances) from every grid cell in the region
to the given target cell by different travel modes (public transport, bike, car, and walking). To consider diurnal
dynamics, the indicators have been calculated separately for the morning rush hour and midday times for public
transport and private car. The data contains 175 059 361 rows and 18 columns (see Table 3). Hence, the data
contains approximately 3.15 billion individual values for year 2018. The number of values is lower for 2015 and
2013 due to lower dimensions: the 2015 dataset does not contain cycling information; the 2013 dataset does not
contain cycling information, nor accessibility information for the morning rush hour.

The datasets are distributed separately for each year as compressed zipfiles. The data have been divided into
13231 text files according to the destinations of the routes. The datafiles have been organized into subfolders that
contain multiple (approx. 4-150) matrix files. Individual folders consist of all the travel time matrices that have
same first four digits in their filename (e.g. 5785xxx). The dataset is licensed with the Creative Commons 4.0 BY
license that allows its use for any purpose (including commercial use) as long as appropriate credit for the dataset
is stated.

Table 3 represents all attributes of the dataset and their description. Accessibility information can easily be
linked back to the statistical grid for visualisation purposes based on the from_id column, which contains a
unique id for each statistical grid cell in the area. Each matrix layer contains travel time (and distance) informa-
tion to a single target. Data are distributed as separate text files for each target grid cell that are named after the
target grid cell-id (ie. to_id), such as travel-times-to-5975375.txt. In the text file, the separator is semicolon (‘;’),
and no-data is reported with value —1. Visualising this information on a map reveals the regional accessibility

patterns in the Helsinki Region by different travel modes, and makes it easy to compare the travel modes to
each other (Fig. 5). The statistical grid can be downloaded from helsinkimatrix.github.io/grid for visualisation
purposes.

Table 4 represents basic statistical characteristics of the data. Because we did the calculations from every grid
cell to every other grid cell in the study area, it is possible to extract the fundamental performance characteristics
of the whole transportation system in the region. These statistics reveal that the average travel time between all
statistical grid squares in the Helsinki Region during rush hour (2018) was 84.3 minutes by public transport and
44.5 minutes by private car. Comparing these values to average cycling travel time by fast cyclist (59.1 minutes)
reveal that cycling is a highly-competitive travel mode: it is faster than public transport on average, and only
15 minutes slower than car during rush hour. However, these travel times assume that the cyclist would be able to
maintain the fast average cycling speed of 19 km/h.

As we calculated the accessibility information for three years, following the same methods and similar data-
sets, it is possible to identify overall trend in the performance of the transportation system in the area. The sta-
tistics show that the travel times in the study area have been increasing slightly during the five-year time-period
(2013-2018). Average travel time by public transport at midday has increased from 81.3 minutes to 86.2 minutes,
whereas the travel time by private car (midday) has increased from 37.7 to 38.9 minutes. The changes are modest,
but they can reveal how the changes in the transportation infrastructure affects the overall performance of the
system from the travel time perspective.

Technical Validation

We validated the data quality systematically by comparing the travel time estimates to other data sources (see
helsinkimatrix.github.io/validation) based on a random sample of 100 locations in the region (Fig. 6). To estimate
the data quality of our public transport travel time estimates, we calculated routes between all sample points (9
900 origin-destination connections) using MetropAccess-Reititin and OpenTripPlanner v1.3 (OpenTripPlanner
community, 2019). We used identical schedules with both tools, ie. 29 January 2018 at 7 am with 10 departure
times according the Golomb ruler (see Methods section). OpenTripPlanner is a widely used public transport
journey planning tool that is also used by Helsinki Region Transport.

For private car, we compared our rush hour car travel times to drive times obtained from the Google Maps
website (www.google.com/maps). Travel time estimates from Google Maps take into account traffic conditions
on the roads at different times of the day and provides typical travel times for given hour of the day. Travel times
on Google Maps are reported as time ranges (such as, “typical travel time is 22-28 minutes”) where the lower
value represents time without congestion effect, and the upper value represents travel time in which congestion
has affected the trip duration. We calculated the arithmetic mean travel time based on the lower and upper values
of Google's travel time estimates following the traffic conditions of Monday 6 May 2019 (a normal workday).
Furthermore, we added an additional 3 minutes to these travel times to approximate the time it takes to find a
parking space and walk to/from the car (following the door-to-door approach). We then compared these values
against average travel time estimates based on the DORA tool using the same approach. We calculated the average

travel times as an arithmetic mean based on the freeflow (column car_s/_t) and rush hour travel times (column
car_r_t).

For cycling and walking, we compared our travel time estimates to OpenTripPlanner using the same walking
(70 metres per minute) and cycling speeds (19 km/h) that we used to produce the dataset. Because our cycling
travel time estimates are based on a custom cycling network which is adjusted according to the observed travel
speeds of Strava users, we also validated the cycling using OpenStreetMap data without any customisation. In
this way, could evaluate if there are differences in the travel time estimates due to algorithmic differences/routing
tools. For cycling, an additional minute was added to OpenTripPlanner time estimates to approximate the time it
takes to lock/unlock a bicycle, following door-to-door approach.

Figure 7 shows that, in general, MetropAccess-Reititin produces slightly higher (6 percent) travel times by
public transport with average travel time of 62.2 minutes compared to OpenTripPlanner’s 58.3 minutes mean
travel time. Car travel time estimates based on DORA are on average three minutes higher (10 percent) com-
pared to estimates obtained from Google Maps. Walking travel time estimates based on MetropAccess-Reititin
are on average 9 minutes shorter (4%) than the travel times calculated by OpenTripPlanner. Cycling travel times
based on DORA are on average 7.6 minutes shorter (13%) compared to OpenTripPlanner estimates when using
OpenStreetMap data (without any modifications), and 13 minutes shorter (22%) when using customised cycling
network based on Strava data. These values are based on the overall travel times of the random sample, and do
not consider trip-wise differences.

Figure 8 represents the differences between the tools in more detail by showing trip-wise differences when
the travel times of each trip between origins and destinations are compared to each other. Trips are ordered by
the duration of the trip (see the upper x-axis labels) to assess if the similarity in travel times changes depending
on the length of the trip. Results show that MetropAccess-Reititin and DORA produce results similar to those
produced by OpentTripPlanner (OTP) and Google Maps with all travel modes up to 30 minutes travel time from
origin (within +5 minutes range). On longer trips, the difference (and variance) in travel times increases, and the
travel time estimates in the matrix tend to be slightly higher with car and public transport (Fig. 8a,b), although
this fluctuates trip by trip. However, the travel times tend to be slightly lower in the matrix by walking and cycling
(Fig. 8c,d). The reason for travel time differences after 30 minutes is most probably due to algorithmic differences
to find the most optimal route: OTP uses the A* routing algorithm, whereas MetropAccess-Reititin and DORA
use Dijkstra’s algorithm.

In addition, differences between the datasets used for routing causes differences. In terms of car analyses,
Google uses its own street network, which differs from OpenStreetMap and Digiroad, and they also utilise
real-time and historical GPS data from mobile phones to produce the travel time estimates, whereas our car
travel time estimates are based on a generalized model that has been built on top of floating car measurements.
There are also clear differences between travel time estimates for cyclists. This can be seen from the faster cycling
travel times with the Strava-adjusted street network that tend to produce faster travel times than the OSM
street network which has not been modified in any way, and the travel times are based on static travel speed
and length of the road segments (Fig. 8e). OTP tend to produce higher travel times than DORA when using an
unmodified OpenStreetMap dataset (Fig. 8d). We believe this difference is related to how the routing network

Fig. 8 Systematic travel time comparisons were conducted with MetropAccess-Reititin, OpenTripPlanner,
DORA and Google Maps to evaluate the data accuracy. The plot shows travel time differences in minutes trip
by trip between randomized validation points by public transport (a), private car (b), walking (c), cycling with
OSM network (d) and cycling with Strava network (e). The differences between the routing tools’ time estimates
are within +5 minutes if the observation is located between the dashed black lines. With car and public
transport, MetropAccess-Reititin and DORA tend to produce slightly higher travel estimates on longer trips,
while with walking and cycling they tend to produce lower travel times.

is generated by default for cycling in OpenTripPlanner. OTP is more selective in terms of the roads that will
be used when routing with bike as there are specific weights applied to roads to produce more “bike friendly”
results. In our data, this approach has not been used and the results represents the unweighted shortest path time
estimates. Further details about bike routing in OTP can be found from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/
OpentTripPlanner#Basic_Permissions.

Considerations on data quality. When assessing the differences between different data sources and tools
(see Validation), it is important to understand that there is no absolute and “correct” travel time between loca-
tions, as the routes and their conditions are always generalisations of reality. Although current data sources and
algorithms can provide accessibility information more accurately than ever, it is important to note, that pure
chance (or “bad luck”) might also have a significant role in increasing (or sometimes decreasing) significantly the
travel time from one location to another. In addition, it is important to understand that travel times by walking
and cycling are greatly influenced by personal characteristics, such as age, fitness, gender and how experienced a
cyclist the person is**”®.

One limitation in the dataset is that there are obvious gaps in the data considering a range of dimensions. If
one’s interest would be to make longitudinal comparisons e.g. between years 2013 and 2018, the current dataset
provides limited number of dimensions for these analyses, namely including midday travel times and distances by

public transport, car and walking. Hence, cycling information is only available for 2018, and rush hour indicators
are only available for 2015 and 2018.

The comparability of the indicators between travel modes relates to the quality of the available input data. Data
used to estimate the congestion levels, or the time that it takes to find a parking space in different parts of the city,
or how much time it takes to get and unlock a bike when departing from home, all affect the results. Furthermore,
obtaining good quality data about these factors can be difficult, which might be a challenge in terms of producing
a similar dataset elsewhere.

Usage Notes

While our dataset covers the Helsinki Region in Finland, the workflow presented is generally applicable to gen-
erating similar datasets in other regions. Globally-available transit schedule datasets following standards such
as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)”’ or Network Timetable Exchange (NeTEx)**, OpenStreetMap”’
road network data, and multimodal routing tools such as OpenTripPlanner make it possible to conduct similar
analyses in thousands of cities across the world. For cycling, Strava’s API°° and heatmap”! serve to retrieve rele-
vant information about cycling speeds in various parts of the world. Openly available traffic data such as Uber
Movement” can be used to retrieve information about traffic conditions and car travel speeds in different parts
of the world.

The dataset presented here allows a variety of different kind of analyses of accessibility. When combined with
other data sources, such as demographic data, it is possible to extract a variety of policy relevant information
about the characteristics and developments of the city region.

Spatial differences in accessibility patterns. One of the most obvious use cases for the data is to inves-
tigate how accessible locations are. This allows questions like, is location A more accessible than B by travel mode
X to be answered. The maps in Fig. 9 represents the travel times to two locations in the study area (airport and
central railway station). The patterns reveal clearly how the accessibility patterns vary between locations. As the
calculations were based on centroids of the statistical grid, it is easy to link accessibility information e.g. with
population data. The cumulative population graphs in the Fig. 9 reveal the number of individuals reaching the
locations within given travel time, and makes it possible to detect differences between locations.

Detecting changes with time series data. The Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix has been produced
for three years: 2013, 2015 and 2018. As the datasets follow the same methodological approaches, it is possible to
detect changes in the transportat system that have occured in the region during the five-year period. Figure 10
represents an example of the annual differences in accessibility for the selected destination (Helsinki- Vantaa
airport) using midday travel times. The maps reveal clear improvements of accessibility to the airport in most of
the region (due to a new direct rail connection), but also a decline in the levels of accessibility in the western part
of the region. The decline occured after a new metro line to the west of the region opened in 2017. This generally
increased the travel times to the airport as more people needed to make transfers between busses and the metro.
In a similar manner, the dataset would allow investigation of diurnal changes (comparing rush hour times to
midday times) and detecting temporal changes by different travel modes.

Travel time differences between travel modes. The door-to-door approach makes it possible to com-
pare travel modes realistically. Figure 11 represents three maps comparing public transport, private car and
cycling to each other. The maps reveal that there are clear differences between travel modes, but the regional
patterns vary depending on which modes are compared.

Detecting the most central areas by travel mode. The Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix is fun-
damentally a 13231-dimensional matrix from the spatial perspective. This makes it possible to extract rich
system-level information from the data considering different transport modes (such as the statistics in Table 4).
Figure 12 presents the most accessible areas (best 10 percent) in the study region by public transport, car and
walking (including overlapping areas). The centrality has been calculated with simple map algebra using local
operation through the 13231-dimensional data. As an output, median travel time was calculated for each location,
and the best 10 percent of those values were selected for this map. The map reveals that the most central areas in
the study area vary significantly depending on the transport mode. The most central areas by public transport are
located more to the south and extend to a few spots with good rail connections, whereas the most central areas
by car are concentrated more to the north where the ring roads and major highways are located. The most central
areas by cycling follow the natural centrality of the street network in the given study area quite closely. This is an
important finding e.g. for city planners and traffic planners when thinking about the equity of service access or
focus areas for public transport development.

Location-allocation. Accessibility is often one of the key criteria for finding an optimal location for a spe-
cific purpose. The dataset described here makes it possible to conduct sophisticated location allocation analysis
based on multiple criteria. Figure 13 shows an example of such analysis, in which accessibility information com-
bining different travel modes have been used together to find the most suitable apartments in the Helsinki Region.
In this example, we integrated the accessibility information in a search tool that identifies optimal locations by
minimizing the need for travel to commonly-visited places such as work, hobbies, school etc. Users can select the
points of interest from the map as well as the travel mode they typically use to travel to the given location and the
number of times the location is visited per week. As a result, the tool finds the most suitable areas in which to buy
an apartment and ranks the available apartments based on this area.
