Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, research challenge is reliable and repeatable movement detection using

Iran electromyography. In this study, the analysis of the muscle synergy pattern has been
considered as a key idea to cope with this main challenge. The main objective of this
research was to provide an analytical tool to recognize six wrist movements through
electromyography (EMG) based on analysis of the muscle synergy patterns. In order to
design such a system, the synergy patterns of the wrist muscles have been extracted and
utilized to identify wrist movements. Also, different decision fusion algorithms were used
to increase the reliability of the synergy pattern classification. The classification
performance was evaluated while no data subject was enrolled. In terms of the achieved
performance, using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network as the fusion algorithm
turned out to be the best combination. The classification average accuracy, obtained in an
offline manner, was about 99.78 + 0.45%. While the classification average cross-validation
accuracy, obtained in an offline manner, using Bayesian fusion, and Bayesian fuzzy
clustering (BFC) fusion algorithm were 99.33 + 0.80% and 96.43 + 1.08%, respectively.

1 Introduction

The electromyogram (EMG) signal represents the electrical potentials generated in the
muscles during muscle contraction, which shows the important neuromuscular informa-
tion [1]. The EMG signal recorded from each surface electrode is the total potential of the
motor units in the region where the electrode is positioned [2]. Due to the useful applica-
tion of EMG signal in clinical diagnoses, and biomedical applications as well as rehabilita-
tion, they are considered as one of the best resources of controlling (i.e., prostheses, robots,
and human-computer interfaces), recognition of intended limb movements [1, 3]. Extensive
research has been done in order to control various functions and increase the efficiency of
prostheses (i.e., several degrees-of-freedom (DoF). One class of the known control ap-
proaches are based on recognizing the pattern of EMG signals elicited from the residual
healthy muscles [3]. Many researchers are engaged in improving the performance of such
recognition algorithms in order to improve the efficiency of prostheses. Hence, the

estimation algorithms, pattern recognition and regression methods [4, 5], and their combin-
ation [6, 7] are among the topics of interest to researchers.

Pattern recognition algorithms are applied to classify the EMG activity patterns in multiple
muscles. So, in these researches, the first step is windowing the EMG signal [8, 9] and extract-
ing a set of important features from time-windowed signal in the time domain (TD) [10, 11]
and in the frequency domain (FD) [10-13]. The computational cost of TD features is less than
the computational of FD features, yet yield comparable classification accuracy [10].. The classi-
fication accuracy in the classification model depends on the type of classification algorithm (ie.,
supervised or unsupervised) and the features which are selected [12], [14, 15]. Also, it depends
on the type of subject (able-bodied or amputee) [3]. Sang et al. [10] recognized six predeter-
mined tasks of muscle activation patterns using TD features and linear discriminant analysis
classifiers in stroke subjects. Similarly, Francesco et al. [16] investigated the recognition of hand
and finger movements individually and reported the different accuracies for able-bodied sub-
jects and amputated ones. They used the feed-forward multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and four
TD features [16]. In the other study, Chu et al. [13], nine types of wrist movements were de-
tected based on packet wavelet analysis using MLP and self-organizing feature map (SOFM)
neural networks with an accuracy of 97%. The research results of the past decades have shown
that the pattern recognition-based methodology has promising results [12]. But some impedi-
ments such as number of the selected features, the computational cost of the required, and the
minimum number of the data required for training the classifier can limit their practical appli-
cations. The other challenge is detecting the movements with multi DoF [17, 18], and some re-
search works were focused on detecting the movement with only one DoF [3, 6, 8].

The authors believe that most of these challenges are raised because of specificity move-
ment detection approaches used in the aforementioned researches. In fact, according to a
specificity approach, activation dynamics of each involved muscle is analyzed distinctly. In
this manner, the muscle coactivation dynamics, characterizing the movement pattern, cannot
be revealed. While using the synergy-based analysis, the muscle interaction dynamics can be
studied. The synergy-based analysis is a type of movement analysis which addresses the
interactive behavior among the involved sub-systems (muscles, joint), instead analyzing the
behavior of each sub-system (muscles, joints) separately. Since the real movement emerged
from the interaction among the muscles, it is expected that the synergy-based analyses can
better reveal and discriminate the different motion dynamics in comparison with the non-
synergetic analyses. Therefore, the analyses approaches designed based on muscle synergy
patterns can be preferable to the analyses approaches based on the electromyography of the
individual muscle distinctly. But most of the related published works have been designed
based on electromyography of the individual muscle distinctly [13-17]. Hence, researchers
believe that controlling and detecting neural information based on synergistic patterns [3, 8,
18-21] is preferable than other methods [2, 4—6]. Recently, studies have been done on the
synergy pattern [3, 8, 18-21]. For example, Jiang et al. [3] extracted muscle synergy patterns
using non-negative matrix analysis in order to two DoF control of wrist. Similarly, Jiaxin
et al. [21] used muscle synergy matrixes to control wrist movements (open, close, pronate,
and supinate). The main goal of this paper is presenting a new muscle synergy-based wrist
movement recognition algorithm. In this study, the extracted muscle synergy patterns were
used as the input data for SOFM classifiers instead the TD or FD features. For improving
the movement recognition performance, six different classifiers were applied, and different
fusion algorithms were used to combine the classification results.

It is worth noting that muscle activation onset can give rise to the presence of transient
dynamics which may degrade the performance of movement classifiers. Therefore, in this
study, a specific algorithm has been utilized for muscle activation onset detection.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Experiments and data collection

In this study, eight able-bodied subjects (5 males, 3 females: 26—40 years; all right-handed)
without any history of a disease or other skeletal disorders participated in the experiment.
Everyone read and signed the consent form before any data was collected and the local eth-
ics committees approved this study. During the experiments, the subject seated comfortably
and held a hand horizontally forward and in pronation. For all individuals, six pairs of Ag—
AgCl surface bipolar electrodes were placed on the extensor digitorum, flexor pollicis
longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, abductor pollicis longus, pronator teres, and supinator fore-
arm muscles. The reference electrode is placed on the ulnar styloid bone. In these subjects,
surface EMG signals of wrist movements were recorded by a commercial bio-signal ampli-
fier (16 channels, ME6000, Canada) with a 1000 Hz sampling frequency. Wrist movements
included extension, flexion, abduction, adduction, pronation, and supination. Each move-
ment was repeated 10 times; the duration of each repetition and the rest time between the
repetitions were recorded 4—5 and 3 s, respectively. Sixty seconds of interruption was con-
sidered between movements individually to relieve muscle fatigue. The total duration of
each movement was 72 + 5 s. The EMG data were filtered between 10 and 450 Hz using a
fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter to reduce the effects of noises and movement arti-
facts. Maximum voluntary contractions were performed before the data were collected to
verify the validation of the electrodes and normalize the signal. All processing was done in
Python library and MATLAB 64 bit, running on a system with a 1.8 GHz processor and 6
GB of memory. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental setup.

The appropriate response time for hand myoelectric control has to be less than 300 ms
[22]. Because, in this manner, no delay will be perceived by user [22]. Therefore, the moving
window length was set to 256 ms (256 samples at 1000 Hz sampling) in conformity with
the previous researches [13, 22]. The more important parameter is window increment
length which data processing has to be carried out during this time band. In this study, ac-
cording to the calculated processing times, the incremental window was set to 10 ms and
increased gradually to 150 ms. Each incremental step was 10 ms. In this manner, the influ-
ence of the incremental window length on the proposed detection algorithm was evaluated.

2.2 The proposed movement detection algorithm

To address the wrist task discrimination problem, we have proposed a protocol that allows
us to use the EMG data for differentiating the tasks from one set. The input of this pro-
posed protocol is EMG data and its outputs are the detected tasks. At the first step, the hier-
archical alternating least squares (HALS) algorithm was used for extracting the muscle
synergies of the wrist movement from filtered EMG signals. Then, extracted muscle syner-
gies, as the extracted features, were regarded as the input data for classification. Two differ-
ent classification algorithms were applied and compared. In the first algorithm, a single
SOFM network was used as a single classifier. In the second algorithm, a fusion method
was utilized alongside six distinct SOFM networks, as six distinct classifiers, for detecting

six different wrist movements. The applied SOFM networks were trained using the Koho-

nen algorithm as an unsupervised algorithm [23]. We evaluated four fusion methods includ-
ing SOFM, MLP fusion, Bayesian fusion, and Bayesian fuzzy clustering (BFC) fusion
algorithm, respectively. The schematic of the proposed scheme is shown in Fig. 2.

In order to assess the proposed algorithms performance, a K-fold cross-validation (K
= 10) method was adopted. For performing this approach, the samples of data recorded
during each wrist movement was labeled firstly to determine the type of wrist move-
ment elicited each recorded data. Then, the labeled data was partitioned into 10 sub-
sets. During each round of cross-validation, the training process performed on one
subset (called training set), and validating process performed on the other subsets
(called the testing set). Multiple rounds of cross-validation were performed using differ-
ent partitions, and the validation results were combined.

2.3 Identification of the synergy model

EMG signal analysis is a linear combination of time-varying muscle synergies, with each
synergy individually having an amplitude and a time shift. The weight coefficient and syn-
ergy of each muscle are different for each motion. Each synergy has a weight coefficient and
a range of amplitude as well as a time shift, by combining these synergies, the muscle activa-
tion pattern is generated [24]. The time-varying synergy model is defined as follows [24]:

(MLP based, Bayesian based, BFC based) were used along with six SOFM classifiers

Here, M is the time-varying muscle activity pattern; N denotes the number of time-
varying synergies, c; is a non-negative coefficient for synergy ith; and ¢; is the delay in
the start of synergy ith. w is a synergistic matrix and w; is the muscle activity for ith
synergy at time ¢;. Here, C and W are non-negative.

The synergy patterns of each movement are extracted by the HALS algorithm [25] from
the corresponding EMG signal. In this method, a gradient of a local cost function based on
the optimality conditions (KTT) [26] is used to update the stationary points (ie., the matrix
of coefficients and the synergies). The cost function using the Frobenius norm is as follows:

1
Di. (M* awe) = 5||M" - cxmell (2)

Where M* is the time-varying muscle activity pattern, C, and W;, are the matrix of
synergy matrixes and their corresponding coefficient matrixes, respectively; k denotes
the number of current iteration of the HALS algorithm.

Detailed description for the synergy is presented in Table 1.

2.4 Applied classification methods

In this study, two different classification methods have been used. Figure 2 shows the struc-
ture of the adopted methods. The first algorithm was designed based on using a single
SOFM without using the fusion algorithms. The second algorithm was designed based on
using multi SOFM alongside the fusion algorithms. The proposed methods are elaborated
in the following subsections.

samples vector and the weight vector of each neuron is taken. The Kohonen algorithm was
used for training the SOFM network. In performing the Kohonen algorithm, the weight vec-
tor of each neuron is updated gradually in a manner that the Euclidean distance between
the input training samples vectors and the weight vector of each neuron reduces. In this
manner, all the neurons are involved in a competition. At the end of the training process,
the neuron which its weight vector has the minimum Euclidean distance to the input train-
ing samples vectors is regarded as the winner neuron among all neurons [23]. This winner
neuron is called the best matching unit (BMU), and its weight vector is called voronoi vec-
tor. The position of the winner neuron within the SOFM network determines the label of
the class which the date belongs to it. The position of the winner neuron changes as the
class which the input training samples vectors belongs to it, changes. In this manner, the
SOFM network can be used for multiclass classification. Accordingly, in this study, the per-
formance of a single SOFM was firstly evaluated for classification of six wrist movements
(Fig. 2, the first algorithm). The range of changes is decreased based on the time and dis-
tance from the BMU. In this study, a 10 x 10 two-dimensional (2D) lattice SOFM with
neighborhood function h(t) with radius of o(¢), a learning-rate parameter y(t), and training
of 1000 epochs were used. The learning rate and neighborhood functions are applied as de-
creasing functions to the SOFM network [13] and defined in (3) and (5), respectively.

In the end, voronoi vectors are applied to the fusion block. Detailed description
for the task discrimination with this approach is presented in Algorithm-I

2.4.2 Classification using multi SOFM

In this approach, each SOFM network was used as a two-class classifier to recognize a
single movement. Since six different movements must be differentiated, six SOFM net-
works were applied (Fig. 2, the second algorithm). Then, for improving the perform-
ance, different fusion algorithms were used to combine the classification results (Fig. 2,
the second algorithm). The applied fusion algorithms are elaborated in the following

sub-sections.

2.4.2.1 MLP-based fusion In this study, the MLP network has been used to
process output data of the SOFM network. The extracted muscle synergy matrixes
were regarded as the input data of the MLP network. The MLP network has two
hidden layers. Each hidden layer had 10 neurons with the rectified linear activation
function (Eq. 6). The number of neurons in the output layer was six, and the soft-
max was regarded as the activation function of the output neurons (Eq. 7).

F(x) =x’ = max(0,x) (6)
Where x is the input to a neuron in hidden layer ith.

In the formula, k represents the index of the output node, and j represents the
indexes of all nodes in the group or layer. The Levenberg-Marquardt used as
the learning algorithm. The network structure was used as determined by trial
and error based on K-fold cross-validation results. Two hidden layers were envi-
sioned which each layer had 10 neurons. Figure 3 shows the structure of the
used MLP.

2.4.2.2 Bayesian model-based fusion The Bayesian classifier is a straight forward based
on probabilities inference. There is a probability model for each quantity that can be
adopted optimal decisions by assumption about the probability distribution of new data. For
estimating the parameters Bayesian model, the maximum likelihood estimation approach is
applied. Given the proposed probability model, Bayesian classifier is trained by supervised
learning. Let us suppose the X is input data which contains n synergy vectors {x;:i= 1, 2, ...,
n}, and Cj shows the jth class which X can belong to it {Cj:j=1, 2, ..., c}. Then, the
conditional probability of class C; to input X is can be calculated as follows [27]:

The conditional probability of class C; to input X is calculated using minimum error
Bayesian classification [27]. The input belongs to a class which has the highest
posterior probability.

P(X|Cj)-P(C))

arg max P(C,|X) = arg max P(X) (9)

Where

P(C;)): The probability of belonging the input data to the jth class (C))

P(C;| X): The probability of belonging the input data to the jth class (C;) given that
the input data is X

P(X| CG): The conditional probability of class C; to input X.

P(X): The probability that the input data is X. P(X) is constant for all classes, only
the P(X| C))P(C;) need to be maximized.

2.4.2.3 Bayesian fuzzy clustering-based fusion Fuzzy clustering is an unsupervised
algorithm which every data point from a data set simultaneously belongs to all
clusters with a varying degree of membership [28]. Each data point, X, for n= 1,
2, ...N has a non-negative membership function u,, in each fuzzy set c=1.2. ....
C. The membership function sum of each data point in all sets is equal to 1, iee.,

3 Results

3.1 Wrist muscle synergies

At the first step, the number of the synergy vectors required to discriminate different
tasks was determined. R* criterion was used to determine the number of synergies in
(22) [19]. Here, SSE is the sum of the remaining squares, SST is the sum of the
remaining squares of the mean activation vector (m). Figure 4 shows the number of
muscle synergies is used in the HALS algorithm to reach the best reconstruction
accuracy. The R* criterion for all individuals and tasks with muscles synergy number
was evaluated (1-8) using (22).

respect to the number of the regarded synergy matrixes. As it can be seen, the
reconstruction accuracy has significantly increased as the number of synergy matrixes
hit 5 and more (p < 0.05). But, no significant improvement was observed when the
number of synergy matrixes increased more the 5 (p > 0.05). As shown in Fig. 6a,
reconstruction accuracy has been significantly improved due to increasing the number
of synergy patterns from one to five (p < 0.05). According to the carried out analyses,
the achieved results were repeatable. For example, as shown in Fig. 6b, the same result
has been achieved using the data recorded during different recording trials. It can be
seen again in Fig. 6 that reconstruction accuracy has been significantly improved due to
increasing the number of synergy patterns from one to five.

3.2 Quantitative comparison of the proposed methods

3.2.1 Evaluation without applying the moving window

At first, the performance of the proposed detection algorithm implemented using
different fusion strategies was evaluated while only 70% of the data recorded during
performing movement used for processing and detection. In other words, the early and
final parts of the data samples, related to muscle activation onset and offset, were
removed. In this manner, the data were related to the transient times coincide with the
muscle activation onset and offset were removed. As a preliminary evaluation, it can be
an acceptable compromise between off-line accuracy and real-time performance [8].

In order to assess algorithms performance, a K-fold cross-validation (K = 10)
method was adopted. Then, the quantitative measures computed to compare the
efficacy of the applied classification methods using ANOVA test. The statistical
analysis showed that there is no significant difference (yp > 0.05) among the overall
accuracies and sensitivities of the classification methods designed utilizing the
MLP, Bayesian, and BFC fusion algorithms along with the classifiers. Overall speci-
ficity of BFC-based classifiers significantly differs from two other classifiers de-
signed based on MLP and Bayesian fusion algorithms (p < 0.05). In addition, there

respect to the number of the regarded synergy patterns

 

is a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the performance of the SOFM-based
classification method and used fusion-based classification methods.

Figure 7 shows the overall results and comparison of the proposed algorithms
using the data recorded from different subjects. As Fig. 7 shows, using a single
SOFM entailed the accuracy value, sensitivity value, and specificity value equal to
87.88 + 1.54%, 83.38 + 1.93%, and 74.51 + 3.03%, respectively. Also, the accuracy
values for MLP, Bayesian, and Bayesian fuzzy clustering (BFC) fusion algorithms
were 99.78 + 0.45%, 99.33 + 0.80%, and 96.43 + 1.08%, respectively. Also,
sensitivity value for MLP, Bayesian, and Bayesian fuzzy clustering (BFC) fusion
algorithms were 99.78 + 0.45%, 99.31 + 0.79%, and 95.93 + 1.74%, respectively. In
addition, the specificity values for MLP, Bayesian, and Bayesian fuzzy clustering
(BFC) fusion algorithms were 98.96 + 1.06%, 98.56 + 1.08%, and 90.63 + 1.56%,
respectively. Overall, the average accuracy, average specificity, and average
sensitivity achieved through utilizing the fusion algorithms were 97%, 95%, and
96%, respectively. While the average accuracy, average specificity, and average
sensitivity achieved through utilizing a single SOFM classifier were less than 88%,
less than 75%, and less than 85%, respectively.

The presence of learning interference due to using a single SOFM classifier might
cause such relatively low efficient classification. In fact, it can be clearly seen that
adopting the fusion algorithms has improved the movements separation.

3.3 Evaluation with applying the moving window

After preliminary evaluations, the detection algorithms were evaluated again while a 256
ms moving window was applied. In fact, a sliding window (256 ms) was moved over the
data recorded during a movement. The time window was moved by the moving step
called window increment length. In this context, an online mechanism for muscle
activation onset detection (integrated profile method) has to be used [29]. According to
the adopted mechanism, the continuous integration of rectified SEMG was conducted.

must be less than or at least equal to the envisioned window increment length.
Therefore, the processing time needed for performing the proposed algorithm as
implemented using different incorporated fusion algorithms. Since the classification
performance using a single SOFM was not acceptable, the single SOFM classifier was
excluded. Table 3 shows the calculated processing time related to the proposed
detection method as implemented using different fusion algorithm.

As Table 3 shows, the needed processing times are less than 10 ms. Accordingly, the
increment window length must be set to at least 10 ms. In order to determine the optimal
increment window length, incremental window length increased gradually from 10 ms to
150 ms. Each incremental step was 10 ms. The statistical analyses (AVOVA) proved that
increasing the increment window length did not have a significant influence on the overall
performance of the proposed classification methods designed using incorporating the
different fusion algorithms (p > 0.05). Therefore, the increment window length was set to
the least possible size equals 10 ms. Then, the assessment procedures repeated again using
K-fold cross-validation method (K = 10). As Fig. 8 shows, using a single SOFM entailed the

In addition, the specificity values for MLP, Bayesian, and Bayesian fuzzy clustering (BFC) fu-
sion algorithms were 97.77 + 0.50%, 97.15 + 0.11%, and 88.24 + 2.11, respectively. Overall,
using the fusion algorithms yielded the average accuracy more than 96%, the average specifi-
city more than 93, and the average sensitivity more than 94%. According to the statistical
analysis, it was showed again that there is no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the
overall accuracies and sensitivities of three utilized fusion-based classification methods.
While overall specificity of BFC-based classifiers significantly differs from two other classi-
fiers designed based on MLP and Bayesian fusion algorithms (p < 0.05).

4 Discussion

In this paper, the separation of different wrist movements based on muscle synergy
patterns was performed using SOFM and based on fusion (i.e., MLP, Bayesian, and BFC)
algorithms. The idea of this approach is to use synergy patterns to cover the coordination
between the muscles. Furthermore, the fusion mechanism was used to enhance the
separation of movements due to the different synergy patterns. The obtained results can
be analyzed from different aspects. We will discuss these aspects as follows.

4.1 Number of the synergy patterns

In this study, the effect of the number of extracted synergy vectors on reconstruction
error of the wrist muscle activation pattern was analyzed. The results show that
increasing the number of synergy vectors more than 5 did not improve the reconstruction
performance. In addition, the performance of the movement detection for all subjects are
close to each other using five identified synergy patterns. As a result, it can be considered
that muscle activity pattern of each movement is extractable with a limited number of
synergy vectors. Such results are in conformity with assumptions related to the muscle
synergy theory [18], [30, 31].

4.2 The role of the fusion algorithms

The preliminary results that showed the performance of a single SOFM, as a classifier,
were not acceptable. It was attributed to the learning interference could arise from
possible mutual dependence among the different EMG signals recorded from different
participants. Therefore, adopting the fusion approaches seemed necessary to prevent
learning interference [32]. Before applying the fusion algorithm, some pre-processing is
recommended to enhance the separability of the input data [32, 33]. In this study, three
fusion algorithms with non-linear, probabilistic nature, and fuzzy characteristics have
been utilized. The obtained results showed that when a fusion method is used, the re-
sults of various movements separation in all participants increased significantly (p <
0.05) compared to a classification using a single SOFM. In fact, instead of using a clas-
sification block SOFM for all different movements, a classification block SOFM is con-
sidered for each separate movement. Then, the final output of the classification blocks
is applied to a fusion block. The statistical analysis showed that there is no significant

difference (yp > 0.05) among the overall accuracies and sensitivities of three utilized
fusion-based classification methods. But, it is worth noting that the average specificity
of BFC-based classification method is significantly less than the average specificity of
the classification methods designed based on two other fusion algorithms. The BFC fu-
sion algorithm works based on creating the membership functions for each clusters
and determining the center of cluster using a probabilistic approach [28]. Therefore,
the performance of this fusion algorithm is fully dependent on the clustering accuracy.
In other words, mis-clustering can give rise to increase the number of members nega-
tively clustered in the clusters except the desired cluster (false positive (FP)). Thus, such
relatively lower specificity can be attributed to relatively high value of FP arises from

likely mis-clustering.

4.3 Comparing with the previous works

Movement discrimination based on synergy muscle can potentially be more appropriate
than other methods since it contains vital information in relation to the muscle activity
pattern generated by neural processes [8]; because synergy vectors represent contractions
of low-dimensions muscle activities [34]. Hence, the analysis of synergy vectors with dif-
ferent techniques could be a good strategy to improve the approach of the upper limb
prostheses. In the last decade, studies have been conducted for movement separation, es-
pecially for controlling prostheses based on muscle synergy analyses [3, 8]. The reported
separation accuracies are about 95% [3, 8]. While, in this study, the separation average ac-
curacy was obtained more than 97%. This relatively increased accuracy can be attributed
to effect of incorporating the fusion algorithms and using six distinct SOFM neural net-
works as classifiers. This elucidates again the degrading role of learning interference on
the performance of the single SOFM-based classifier.

5 Conclusion

In this study, the separation of different wrist movements based on muscle synergy
analysis was investigated. In fact, instead of considering each muscle activity patterns and
features of each muscle individually, the synergy pattern of movement was extracted.
Since the separation of the activity of each muscle and the elimination of the interactions
of other muscles is difficult, the authors believe that synergy vectors can be used directly
for controlling the rehabilitation and dependent devices in further innovation. The
promising achieved classification accuracy can confirm such believe. Nevertheless, more
experimental data has to be recorded and has to be analyzed to prove decisively that the
achieved results are generalizable. In addition, though the EMG is a good tool to analyze
the muscle electrical activity, but the EMG devices are relatively expensive devices and
the EMG preprocessing is time consuming. Thus, using the cheap and reliable muscle
sensors is preferable for practical implementation of electromyography-based motion de-
tection system. It is recommended to perform initial evaluations on patients in order to

implement it practically on basic microcontroller systems.
