1. INTRODUCTION

Clouds computing becoming the most prominent technology due to it services because it provide
the services with the help of internet and work on the base of pay and gain rule these services consist of
hardware and software [1,2]. These applications are used in various field of life and improve the quality of our
life. Cloud computing is emerging technology due to its main property which is know as virtualization process.
Different physical machine run as virtual machine.Vitual machine play important role in cloud computing.
Cloud computing become popular among the communities of business and researcher due to it virtualization
property [3, 4]. Figure 1 show the working of cloud computing in which different devices are connected and
get their required application. It is emerging field which is used for enormous-scale disseminated computing.
Its framework used for ultimatum network admittance to achieve collective puddle of computing resource.
As we know that cloud computing is increasing rapidly and user demand for better services in accurate and
fast time [5, 6]. Cloud computing architecture consists of four layers. The inner layer is the hardware layer next
to the inner layer is the infrastructure layer. Platform layer is above the infrastructure layer and the application
layer is the outermost layer [7, 8]. There are four types of cloud computing which are used in different field of
life with specific rule and respective specification [9]. Types of cloud computing which private cloud, public
cloud, hybrid cloud and community cloud computing. Virtualization is one of the main characteristic of cloud
computing. Virtualization is the process in which physical instance of single application or resource share
among multiple organization or users. This technique is done by assigning physical resources as logical
form [10, 11]. Its play an important role in cloud computing like sharing data as application but actually with

the help of virtualization user share the infrastructure. Furthermore the main elements of virtualization are
known as VM (virtual machine) [12, 13].

A single physical resource can appear as multiple resources this process can be achieved with the help
of a virtual machine. It contains matched environment for a physical computer system its run an operating
system and applications[14, 15]. It can be implemented through with the help of software, framework, and
hardware. With the help of VM cloud computing reduce the real operating cost but still there are
different issues facing by VM which are storage of resource, time, resource wastage, energy and data
management [16, 17]. Resource allocation is the process which provides service and storage for data or
particular task. Resource allocation is one of the important issue still exit in cloud environment and it has
various level of issue like scheduling, computational, performance, relocation response time, QoS, and energy
management system [18, 19]. In this study we focus on data allocation sysytem for VM system for cloud
computing in the related work we study about the Grey Wolf technique which is used for scheduling process
in VM and find out gap and desgin propsed technique for that gap.

2. RESEARCH METHOD

The author [20] proposed GWO-VMP algorithm for virtual machine placement for improvement in
energy efficiency in cloud data centre. Because different active physical servers they are reducing the power
consumption. Therefore the author used this technique to reduce the active host and make less energy
consumption. The technique reduces the VM number and save more energy so the proposed technique is
effective in energy management system for cloud computing.

The author [21] modified Grey Wolf technique for multi objective task scheduling in cloud
computing. With the help of proposed technique improve the time, executation cost, and energy consumption.
In the proposed technique the author change the fitness function and update additional term is incorporated
using the combination of alpha and beta solutions due to these change it improve the result of the network.

The author [22] modified Grey Wolf technique for improvement in data scheduling in cloud
computing. The modification took place in encircling and hunting operations have been modified by adding
mean value to the equations. It is used for improving the efficiency of each wolf's motion and suitable path in
searching area. With the help of this improvement the energy consumption and task executation improve in
cloud computing.

The author [23] used Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm for parallel Job scheduling in cloud
computing with the help of this technique it reduces the makespan and flow time. Changes are make in
the fitness function and it makes quite significant improvment over the task executation in cloud computing.

The author [24] proposed a hybrid technique with the combination of particle swarm optimization
(PSO), Biogeography-based optimization and Grey wolf technique used for resource allocation technique in
cloud computing. The proposed technique improves the throughput using well balanced load across virtual
machines and overcome the problem of trap into local optimum based on the result the proposed technique
work more efficient.

The author [25, 26] used GWO algorithm for VM allocation system before the user sent request for
resource manager which forward this message to the tuner it sent to all groups for resource but the researcher
used the new technique which work on prioritization system therefore the load on server substantially reduced
and improve response time and preparation time.

The author [26, 27] proposed Grey Wolf Algorithm it consist of different parameter which are alpha
(a) wolf, beta (B) wolf and delta (6) wolf and the other reaming are called omega (@) solutions. The author

modified first two step and improve the eliminate the waiting time in data allocation system of cloud
computing. Based on result the proposed algorithm reduces the total query execution time and resource
consumption. From the study of related work it seem that Grey Wolf algorithm used for data allocatin system
for VM in cloud computing after the study of realted work it seen that Grey Wolf algorithm need some
modification at some section for improvement in data allocation system in VM therefore in this study we
improve two main section of the algorithm with the help of those changes we improve some of the main
parameter of load balancing technique in cloud computing.

3. METHODOLOGY

The resource scheduling indicates the process of assigning the different task to different VM which is
hosted on PMs of cloud data centre. Some situation these task are not properly distributed among different VM
which affected the network performance. Therefore in this study proposed M.GWO technique which allocate
the data to different VM in cloud computing. In the modified GWO technique two section are modified first
section ABC algorithm searching section used for first iteration or local iteration because the GWO algorithm
local search is not good as compare to ABC algorithm second modification make at fitness function of GWO
technique it due to the improvement of energy system of the network. Cloud computing consist of different
dynamic servers which provide the required of different user. Different VM assign different task by cloud data
centre and they depends on different policies and as well as different load. If resource allocation not done
properly in cloud computing it efficient on the entire network. Lets task [T1, T2......Tn] and different VM are
present as VM [VM1, VM2......VMn]. So in the proposed technique is design that we assign proper task to
proper VM and for selection of VM randomly selection methord used by ABC local selection methord which
express below.

Where K o@ [1,2....n] and j a [1,2...n] are randomly choice indexes Xij is the current food source with the ith

The Grey wolf optimizer technique consists of grouped in to 4 classes which are alpha, beta, delta and
omega. Alpha present the leader from leader lowest domain present omega best solution is the top-level a,
the second-best solution is level B, the third-best solution is 6 and other solutions belong to the lowest level o.

From the second iteration the vectors A and € are calculated as.

Where the length(i) is the length of cloudlet (1) and Pei is the number of processing element (PE)
request by cloudlet (1) MIPSj (millions of instruction per second) PEi is the number of PE in VMj and n is
the number of VMs in a data center. Hence we need to choose the solution schedule such that the F value is
minimized [28, 29].
