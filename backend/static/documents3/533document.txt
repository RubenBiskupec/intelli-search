1. INTRODUCTION

It is the way toward procuring more elevated level data of a picture, for example, shading, shape and
Texture. It is one of the significant qualities utilized in recognizing items or Region of enthusiasm for
a image. Surface, the example of data or exhibit of the structure set up in a image, is a huge component of
many images types [1]. From a general perspective, surface alludes to surface attributes and presence of
Texture highlights can be removed in a few strategies, utilizing factual, auxiliary, and model-based and
change data, in which the most well-known way is utilizing the gray level co event matrix (GLCM). GLCM
contains the second-request factual data of spatial relationship of pixels of a image [2].

Generally, the exactness of any arrangement framework mostly relies upon the best possible
decision of the highlights. Thus it is fundamental to locate a decent arrangement of highlights. Essential
period of structure in any grouping framework is the choice of a decent arrangement of highlights which have
the capacity of sign detachment in the component space. An order calculation will consistently give an
outcome, yet a poor element portrayal will prompt an outcome that doesn't mirror the genuine idea of
the hidden information. The information ought to be streamlined without loss of data. Finding the best
highlights is a troublesome assignment, and it frequently must be practiced through an experimentation
procedure. In this work, a dim level co-event grid (GLCM) is utilized, which is a measurable technique that
uses the spatial relationship of pixels.

Davis et al., [3] started the use of dim level co-event grid (GLCM) so as to discover the highlights
that are to be produced dependent on a pixel's neighborhood. Davis et al., proceeded with crafted by in such
a method of the directional dispersion of GLCM includes and proposed a lot of polar gram measurements
which are rotationally invariant. Haralick et al., [4] recommended that revolution invariant highlights could
be acquired from co-event networks by taking the normal and scope of each element type over the four points
that is utilized. The dark level distinction insights is another surface depiction technique, which is firmly
identified with GLCM, Weszka et al., [5]. A co-event grid, additionally alluded to as co-event appropriation,
is characterized over a picture to be the dissemination of co-happening esteems at a given balance. It speaks
to the separation and rakish spatial relationship over a picture sub-locale of explicit size. The GLCM is made
from a dim scale picture. The GLCM is determined how regularly a pixel with dim level (grayscale force or
Tone) esteem I happens either on a level plane, vertically, or corner to corner to adjoining pixels with
the worth j. A notable factual apparatus for removing second-request surface data from pictures is the dark
level co-event. The GLCM lattice is one of the most well known and viable wellsprings of highlights in
surface examination. For a district, characterized by a client determined window, GLCM is the lattice of
those estimations over all dim level sets. In this technique, highlights are determined dependent on the total
contrasts between sets of dim levels or normal dim levels rather than unique dark level pixel values [6].
This methodology makes the measurements somewhat more powerful to brightening varieties than on
account of GLCM. The paper is organized as follows. The image information base is portrayed in segment 2.
The component extraction strategies are portrayed in segment 3. The arrangement strategy is listed in area 4.
The examination work is finished up in segment 5.

2. IMAGE DATABASE

The images used for testing the algorithms developed are medical images. In this work also,
the normal lung images and a cancer affected lung images are taken from fifty different peoples to
characterize the lung cancer. The image data for this research work is grouped as normal and abnormal
images. The Medical Images are CT Lung axial view images, CT Lung sagittal view images and CT Lung
coronel view images are taken from ten different people in DICOM format. A sample of normal CT lung and
cancer affected CT lung images are shown in Figures | and 2 [7, 8].

3. HARALIC TEXTURE FEATURES

Haralick implemented fourteen texture features from GLCM for an image. These features are
as follows:
- Entropy: It is a measure of randomness of the input image. Mathematically, it can be represented by

ij-o PG, j) * [-InPG,j)] (1)

- Contrast: It will measure the intensity or gray-level variations between the reference pixel and its neighbor.
Contrast = )N=4 n2 Yi — j = nPd(i,j) (2)

- Correlation: This feature measures how a pixel is correlated to its neighborhood. It the equation is given by

sic;
- HomogeneityL: The equation is given by
y=0(PG j)11 + Gi — j)} (4)
- Energy: itis represented by
E= Yivzo PC j)2 (5)

- Autocorrelation: It is the measure of the coarseness of the image. If low value, texture is rough.
- Dissimilarity: It is a measure of dissimilarity between gray pixels of an image.

- Cluster shade: The cluster shade will give information about the skewness of the matrix.

- Variance: The equation is given by

Zio Lyeo i— HW) PdO(i, j)? (6)
- Angular second moment (ASM): The equation is given by
_ _ v2
Xizo Lj=o PdOGi,}) (7)

- Inverse difference moment (IDM): IDM measures the closeness of the distribution of the GLCM
elements to the GLCM diagonal.

Here Fast Fuzzy C means algorithm used for segmentation. Threshold segmentation is called
the threshold process, the easiest for of segmentation of images. This approach is based on a clip-level
(or threshold value) to turn a gray-scale image into a binary one. The trick to this approach is to pi the thread
value [9]. The segmentation goal is to reduce or alter an images portrayal into one that is more concrete unit
simpler to interpret. I make segmentation usually used in the CT images to identify normal and cancer. In this
research work many classification algorithms have been developed for finding cancer in Lung images [10].
In this work, the identification task done by classification method from a set of groups the images [11].

4. RESULT AND DISCUSSION

This section centers around back-propagation neural network (BPN) system-based classifiers that
are appropriate for deciding sickness [12]. One of the generally experienced dynamic errands of human
movement is order. The order can be characterized as the distinguishing proof undertaking to which
a lot of the gathering, another perception has a place, based on preparing a lot of information containing
observation [13, 14]. In this examination work, the diverse CT images are the gatherings and the preparation
information incorporate the highlights, which were removed from typical and strange images [15, 16].

In this work, the BPN organize is utilized for characterizing the CT images. The highlights are
separated from CT images of ordinary lung and malignant growth influenced lung are taken into
the examination. GLCM based highlights are extremely helpful in distinguishing sicknesses since
the highlights are indicating the wide contrast between the two classes [17, 18]. The BPN is utilized to
arrange these images [19, 20]. The exactness of the system is changed so as to improve the order of
the classes dependent on the capacity of created calculation. The inferred highlights, which are tabulated in
Table 1, gives a wide distinction between the typical and malignant growth pictures and the proposed
pressure calculations don't influence the qualities much. The ideal calculation is picked dependent on
the arrangement accuracy [21, 22]. The GLCM features are analysed in this work, so as to characterize
the lung CT images. The variation between the normal image and cancer image, clearly reveal the capability
of this method to classify the normal image from the cancer image [23-25].

5. CONCLUSION

In this work, the algorithm is developed for classify the bio medical images. The features are
extracted from CT images of normal Lung and Cancer affected Lung is taken into the study. Even though,
each disease type has unique characteristics and patterns, some similarities are also found among these
categories that will lead to difficulty in designing a classifier with a correct decision boundary.
Hence, the selection of features is a complex problem, which is overcome by careful trial and error process.
Moreover, efficient feature selection is still a problem in medical Images and it can be addressed in future,
in an effective manner to achieve better results. The classification accuracy of the Binary classifier finds
the proposed algorithms suitable for identifying the cancer disease.
