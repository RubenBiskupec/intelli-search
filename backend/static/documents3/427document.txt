nondestructive study of the permeability of
multiple oocytes

Abstract

Investigation of oocyte membrane permeability plays a crucial role in fertility preservation, reproductive medicine, and
reproductive pharmacology. However, the commonly used methods have disadvantages such as high time
consumption, low efficiency, and cumbersome data processing. In addition, the develoomental potential of oocytes
after measurement has not been fully validated in previous studies. Moreover, oocytes can only maintain their best
status in vitro within a very limited time. To address these limitations, we developed a novel multichannel microfluidic
chip with newly designed micropillars that provide feasible and repeatable oocyte capture. The osmotic responses of

three oocytes at different or the same cryoprotectant (CPA) concentrations were measured simultaneously, which
greatly improved the measurement efficiency. Importantly, the CPA concentration dependence of mouse oocyte
membrane permeability was found. Moreover, a neural network algorithm was employed to improve the efficiency
and accuracy of data processing. Furthermore, analysis of fertilization and embryo transfer after perfusion indicated
that the microfluidic approach does not damage the developmental potential of oocytes. In brief, we report a new
method based on a multichannel microfluidic chip that enables synchronous and nondestructive measurement of the

permeability of multiple oocytes.

Introduction

Oocyte permeability refers to the water conductivity
(Lp) and other small molecule permeability (P,) of the
oocyte membrane’. Investigation of oocyte membrane
permeability plays a crucial role in fertility preservation,
reproductive medicine, and reproductive pharmacol-
ogy”. These studies significantly promote the develop-
ment of assisted reproductive technology (ART)*. In
particular, oocyte cryopreservation” ’ has attracted ever-
increasing interest® and has been considered one of the
most promising techniques to preserve human fertility’.
However, despite encouraging achievements in successful
fertilization and birth, the pregnancy success rate of

cryopreserved oocytes remains quite low’”'’, which is

because current methods for cryopreservation still have
shortcomings’. Generally, the oocyte cryopreservation
process includes cryoprotectant (CPA) addition/removal
and a freeze-thaw cycle’’®. Oocytes are more sensitive to
extracellular osmotic pressure variations than other
cells'’, During cryopreservation, oocytes are more sus-
ceptible to osmotic shock to CPA solutions, as well as
extra/intracellular ice formation-induced mechanical
injury’'*. Therefore, accurate measurement of oocyte
membrane permeability is of great significance in the field
of oocyte cryopreservation and ART”.

The permeability of the oocyte membrane has pre-
viously been extensively investigated'”'°-*°. Traditionally,
micropipette perfusion and direct microscopic observa-
tion were utilized to quantify the permeability parameters
of the oocyte membrane~”*””®. With the development of
microfluidics””-**, microfluidic devices have shown great
advantages and prospects in cell research*’**. Diverse

microfluidic devices have been developed to measure the
permeability of oocytes instead of using manual methods.
For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic
platforms were reported to quantitatively measure oocyte
volume response during CPA addition'®'®. Recently, a
microfluidic platform with precise temperature control
was reported for studying the temperature dependence of
oocyte permeability*’. In addition, a non-PDMS-based
microscope diffusion chamber and _ microperfusion
chamber were reported to measure the permeability of
oocytes’, Zhao’s group recently developed a novel
sandwich-structured microfluidic perfusion approach for
accurately characterizing the permeability of human
oocytes and achieving high-quality oocyte selection’**'.
However, all of the above methods can only measure a
single oocyte or sole CPA concentration at one time.
These methods are labor intensive or have low efficiency,
which greatly restricts their applications’”. In addition, the
developmental potential of measured oocytes has not been
fully validated in the above studies. As is known, oocytes
are a precious cell type and can only maintain normal
viability within several hours after extraction*”*’. The
developmental potential of oocytes also has a profound
impact on the early development and pregnancy of
embryos’. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a device
capable of simultaneously and nondestructively measuring
the membrane permeability of multiple oocytes. In addi-
tion, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of CPA con-
centration on the permeability of oocyte membranes has
received less attention and has not been fully investigated”.

Herein, we present a new microfluidic approach that is
suitable for the simultaneous study of the permeability of
multiple oocytes. The newly designed micropillars in the
microchannel support oocyte automatic capture while
avoiding undesired influences on extracellular CPA mix-
ing. The chip provides simultaneous measurement of
three oocytes exposed to three independent osmotic
shifts, thereby making it possible to investigate the CPA
concentration-dependent of oocyte membrane perme-
ability. In addition, the chip can simultaneously measure
three oocytes exposed to the same osmotic shift, which
greatly improves the measurement efficiency. Moreover, a
neural network algorithm is employed to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of data processing. Furthermore,
subsequent fertilization and embryo transfer (in vitro
fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET)) indicate that
the microfluidic approach does not impair the develop-
mental potential of oocytes. These special features can
enable nondestructive and high-efficiency measurement
of oocyte permeability and CPA concentration depen-
dence. We are confident that this novel microfluidic
approach has great application prospects in the field of
fertility preservation, reproductive medicine and repro-
ductive pharmacology.

Results
Microfluidic chip and its system

The microfluidic chip is shown in Fig. la. The channel
sizes are 200 and 150 um (Wx H). Two inlet (Ij, In) paths
are designed with a symmetrical structure, and the dis-
tance from the inlet to the outlet is the same to ensure the
same resistance. A serpentine channel is designed to allow
the solution to mix thoroughly and achieve different
concentrations, which can be used for investigating per-
meability concentration dependence. The structure for
oocyte capture, each channel has two micropillar obsta-
cles. The size of each micropillar is 20 um in radius and
150 um in height. The obstacles set here are to capture
oocytes, to prevent the oocytes from entering the ser-
pentine channel, and to retrieve them easily. Moreover,
the newly designed micropillars can avoid undesired
influences on extracellular CPA mixing. During the
experiment, oocytes are injected and retrieved from cell
inlets (Cy, Cy2, and Cj3). Figure 1b shows the main pro-
cedure of chip fabrication.

As shown in Fig. $1, the whole system mainly includes a
BDS series inverted biological microscope (Aote Optics,
Chongqing, China), microfluidic chip, and high-precision
programmable syringe pumps (WK-101P, Nanjing Anerke
Electronic Technology, Nanjing, China). The microscope is
equipped with an industrial camera (KP-2307 HD, KOP-
PACE, Shenzhen, China) and connected to computer soft-
ware to observe and record the morphological changes of
the oocytes. In this system, silicone hoses are used to con-
nect the syringe pumps to the inlets of the microfluidic chip.
These silicone hoses are of a certain thickness, which can
improve the anti-interference ability and reduce the dis-
turbance. The oocyte inlet channel is connected to the cell
transplantation hose via a 0.7 mm needle.

Simulation of the CPA solution concentration profile and
flow in the microfluidic channel

For the simulation results, the geometrical parameters
and their boundary conditions are similar to those of the
experimental microfluidic chip, as shown in Fig. $2. To
ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the experimental
model, finite element method (FEM) was used to obtain
the variation in solution concentration at several specific
points (P1 to P31). The simulated concentration changes
along the mixing channel at these specific points are
shown in Table S1. The concentrations at inletl and
inlet2 are 1.5 and 0.5 M, respectively. Both inlets are set to
the same flow rate of 10 uL/min. As shown in Fig. 2a, two
solutions gradually mix when flowing through the inter-
mediate channel, and the characteristics of the laminar
flow in the microchannel appear at the initial intersection.
When driven along the respective paths, due to the con-
centration difference, the solute diffuses at the boundary
of the contact. After a certain length of the serpentine

channel, the solution gradually mixes and reaches equi-
librium. The velocity profiles of the solution flow in the
three serpentine channels are almost the same (Fig. 2b).
The final concentration of the middle channel is the
average of the initial concentrations at the two inlets, as
shown in Fig. 2c. These results demonstrate that the
concentration gradient generation structure of the chip
can effectively achieve different concentrations, and when
reaching the oocyte capture region, the solution has
reached the required consistency. Figure 2d shows the
CPA solution concentration profile in the whole micro-
fluidic chip. Since the size of the microchannel is not very
large relative to mouse oocytes, the replacement of the
solution around the oocytes can be seen as a uniform
process. To further investigate the rationality of the
oocyte capture region design, the detailed simulation
results are shown in Fig. 2e. This subfigure displays the
detailed concentration profile, flow rate and shear rate of
the oocyte capture region. It should be noted that opti-
mization design of the oocyte capture region was con-
ducted. Three other different capture structures were
designed and modeled to compare the pros and cons, as
shown in Fig. $3. The results demonstrate that the design

 

that we used is much better than other designs because
the flow rate and shear rate are both optimal and have
minimal impact on oocytes.

Characterization of the solution concentration change in
the microfluidic channel

To verify the validity of the FEM, the solution flow in
the microfluidic channel was verified by fluorescent dye
and food dye solutions. Two fluorescent dye solutions
were prepared by adding two different doses of sodium
fluorescein to an aqueous solution. These solutions
exhibit green fluorescence under blue excitation light.
Two syringe pumps were simultaneously turned on to
inject two concentrations of fluorescent dye solution into
the microchannel, and the mixing of the solution was
judged by the fluorescence intensity at different positions.
The fluorescence images at different locations of the
channel were obtained by software photographing, and
then, acquired images were further processed to obtain
the fluorescence intensity graph, as shown in Fig. 3a. This
subfigure shows the fluorescent solution flowing through
the microchannels, and the two partially enlarged views
represent the middle mixing channel and the oocyte

capture locations. Under a fluorescence microscope
(BX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), the process of gradual
mixing between two solutions can be seen in the micro-
channel. Three oocyte capture locations also showed
different fluorescence intensity variations. To further
obtain the quantitative results of the fluorescence inten-
sity, different positions were selected along the mixing
channel to measure the fluorescence intensity variation.
The normalization fluorescence intensity curve (Fig. 3b)
indicates that the fluorescence intensity at the exit of the
serpentine mixing channel decreases to half of the initial
maximum intensity, which means that the mixing of the
two solutions has been completed, and the mixed solution
with the required concentration will reach the oocyte
capture region. Meanwhile, the normalized fluorescence
intensity change at three oocyte capture locations (Fig. 3c)
indicates that the concentration of the three capture
locations has multiple relationships, which is consistent

 

with our design philosophy. Moreover, the fluorescence
map corresponding to three oocyte capture locations with
the same concentration and fluorescence intensity varia-
tion at three oocyte capture locations is shown in Fig. S4.

In addition, a two-color food dye solution mixing
experiment in the middle channel was conducted. As
shown in Fig. 3d, two kinds of food dye are utilized to
prepare solutions, and three flow rate ratios are selected.
The two solutions occupy different spaces of the channel
at first and then mix along the serpentine channel. Finally,
the solution becomes one color. With different ratios, the
final color tone is different. These results also demon-
strate the practicability and rationality of the microfluidic
chip.

part (Up Block) in the green dotted box (Fig. 4a). Blue
dotted arrow lines indicate the skip connections. The blue
and green bars both include two convolutional layers,
while orange only includes one. The Up Block model
supports the construction of accurate results, which is
similar to the Down Block. With skip connections,
information can be directly transferred from the Down
Block to the Up Block.

The most important part of the neural network method
is to train the network to achieve precise results*’. The
data used for training are prepared as shown in Fig. 4b. An
image containing one oocyte (256 x 256 pixel) is taken out
as the data set, and the corresponding label image
represents a correct image segmentation. Approximately
2000 images and 250 images were extracted from different

 

experimental videos and used as the training set and
validation set, respectively, to train the neural network.
Figure 4c shows the loss function curve of the neural
network, which indicates the performance of the image
process. In this subfigure, one epoch represents that all
the training sets are used once. The loss values of the
training set and validation set decrease with similar
trends, and both loss values converge well after training
for 100 epochs. The training and validation curves almost
coincide with each other, indicating that the neural net-
work does not suffer from overfitting. Moreover, the
training accuracy and validation accuracy are 0.9857 and
0.9790, respectively. Compared with that of traditional
manual processing and other image processing methods,
the test accuracy is 0.9820. These results indicate that our
neural network method is much better and more

the oocyte volume response. The segmented images can
be obtained by inputting the original images into the

drawn in the corresponding input image based on the
black-and-white boundary of the segmented image to
visualize the coincidence degree between the original

that the input images and the segmented images have very
high coincidence, which proves the accuracy of the neural
network method. In general, neural network algorithms

 

significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data
processing.

Oocyte volume responses to CPA, determination of mouse
oocyte membrane permeability and its CPA concentration
dependence

To study the effects of different concentrations and
kinds of CPA on oocyte membrane permeability, experi-
ments were performed at room temperature (23 °C) using
three different concentrations of ethylene glycol (EG) and
1,2-propanediol (PG), separately. Representative micro-
graphs of the oocyte volume response to different CPA
concentrations are shown in Fig. 5a. There is one oocyte
captured in each channel. It can be seen that the volume

of oocytes undergoes a process of shrinking and then
expanding. Owing to the initial difference in the chemical
potential of intra- and extracellular water, oocytes were
first dehydrated and then gradually rehydrated because of
the effect of the cotransport of water and CPA. Never-
theless, the oocyte volume response with time is slightly
different because the concentrations in the three channels
are different from each other. Moreover, oocytes in three
channels were simultaneously added to the same con-
centration of CPA solution, and the corresponding
representative micrographs are shown in Fig. S5. In this
study, to avoid oocyte deformation by external mechanical
stress, slow mixing was adopted when perfusing CPA
solution. The zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte
provides a good supporting effect to prevent the closed
oocyte membrane from being deformed by external

mechanical stress. In addition, any oocytes with irregular
or aspherical volume changes were not selected during
data processing to ensure measurement accuracy.

Figure 5b, c shows the normalized volume changes of
representative oocytes exposed to EG and PG at three
different concentrations and the corresponding curve
fitting results (lines) with a two-parameter (2-p) transport
model. In addition, the normalized volume changes of
representative oocytes exposed to the same CPA con-
centrations (1.5 M EG and 1.5 M PG) are shown in Fig. 5d, e.
The normalized volume can eliminate the influence of
the volume difference of oocytes. As observed from the
results, for a given CPA, the volume changes caused by
different concentrations are not the same, and for the
same concentration, the volume changes caused by dif-
ferent CPAs are also different. Therefore, prior to the

addition and removal of CPA, it is necessary to consider
not only the concentration added at each step but also the
type of CPA used. For EG and PG, the change in oocyte
volume is relatively low at the concentration of 0.5 mol/L,
causing an insignificant effect on oocytes. However, at
concentrations of 1 and 1.5 mol/L, the change in oocyte
volume is intense, which causes a negative impact.
Moreover, the change in the oocyte volume due to EG is
more intense than that with PG. The above results show
that for the addition of EG to oocytes, a lower con-
centration step should be adopted to avoid excessive
damage. By fitting the experimental volume change data,
the permeability coefficient L, of the oocyte membrane to
water and the permeability coefficient P, to the CPA can
be obtained, and the specific values are shown in Fig. 5f, g.
It can be seen that at the same temperature, the perme-
ability of the oocyte membrane to different kinds of CPA
is different. In addition, the determined L, and P, of
mouse oocytes with different concentrations of EG and
PG are listed in Table S2. It can be seen that the per-
meability values of oocytes increase with increasing con-
centration. The permeability (ZL, and P,) of the mouse
oocyte membrane to EG and PG reported in the literature
using the standard technique is also listed in Table S3 for
comparison with the values of this study.

Fertilization and developmental potential analysis after
the experiment

To investigate whether the microfluidic chip and the
approach that we used impair the physiological function

of the oocytes, in vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed
to inseminate the oocytes postperfusion to assess the
developmental potential. The fertilized oocytes were cul-
tured for both the control group and the perfusion group.
As presented in Fig. 6a, phase contrast micrographs show
the morphologies of the mature oocytes and embryo at
the 2PN stage, 2-cell stage, 4-cell stage, 8-cell stage, and
16-cell stage. There was no visible difference in terms of
the morphology and development capacity of the perfused
oocytes compared with the control group. In addition,
there was no statistically significant difference in the fer-
tilization and cleavage rates between the two groups (Fig.
6b). These results are attributed to the slow and steady
flow rate of the perfusion fluids, which can alleviate
osmotic stress. This approach has a very important pro-
tective effect on oocytes because oocytes are much more
sensitive to osmotic shock. The developmental potential
verification indicates that our microfluidic chip and
method are feasible and safe for oocytes.

To further confirm that the procedure used in this study
is safe and valid, an in vitro embryo transfer study was
also conducted. The 2-cell embryos obtained from per-
fused oocytes and fresh oocytes were transferred into the
oviducts of pseudopregnant females. Figure 6c shows a
photo of embryo transfer surgery. Approximately 3 weeks
after the embryo transfer, offspring were produced. Ima-
ges of the baby mice 1 day and 1 week after birth are also
shown in Fig. 6c; the mice grew well, and there were no
abnormalities. The birth rates of the control group and
perfusion group (Fig. 6d) were 57.5% vs. 48.3%,
Chen et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:55

respectively, and no obvious difference was observed. The
rates of fertilization, cleavage and reproduction of the
control group and the perfusion group are listed in Table
$4. Offspring production further demonstrates the prac-
ticability and effectiveness of the microfluidic chip and
research method.

Discussion

The above measured membrane permeability para-
meters can further be utilized to optimize oocyte cryo-
preservation, reproductive pharmacology, etc. For
example, during cryopreservation of oocytes, to avoid
osmotic damage, it is common to use a stepwise CPA
addition/removal protocol. However, this protocol pro-
longs the exposure time of the oocytes to CPA, which will
cause severe cytotoxic damage. Using the determined L,
and P, values, we can predict cell migration during CPA
addition/removal and develop an optimal CPA protocol
to minimize osmotic damage and cytotoxicity to oocytes.
In addition, this approach can help to minimize solute
damage and intracellular ice formation by optimizing the
cooling rates*’. Understandably, measurement of mem-
brane permeability parameters plays a vital role in
achieving successful oocyte cryopreservation. Further-
more, such measurements can help to select the optimal
CPA for a particular cell type, helping to optimize the
addition and removal of CPA. We are confident that the
current approach also has great prospects in the cryo-
preservation of other cells.

In previous studies, the permeability of the cell mem-
brane to water and CPA was considered constant and
independent of CPA concentration**. However, there is
evidence that the water permeability decreases with
increasing CPA concentration*®**’. The CPA concentra-
tion dependence on permeability has received less atten-
tion in the literature, and these studies have yielded
conflicting conclusions. Moreover, there has been no
study on the concentration dependence of mouse oocyte
membrane permeability. According to the results of this
study, the permeability of the oocyte membrane to water
and CPA both increases as the concentration increases,
which is different from other cells. Presumably, this result
may be because oocytes contain more intracellular water
because of their larger size. At a certain concentration of
CPA, the permeability of the oocyte membrane is posi-
tively correlated with the concentration of CPA. There-
fore, the permeability of the oocyte produces a different
result from other cells. Nonetheless, further research is
required for verification.

In conclusion, accurate characterization of the perme-
ability of the oocyte membrane is of great significance to
the investigation of oocyte cryopreservation, assisted
reproduction, and reproductive pharmacology. Here, a
specific microfluidic chip was developed to synchronously

Page 9 of 12

and nondestructively measure the permeability of multi-
ple mouse oocytes. The chip integrates three independent
microchannels, which automatically capture oocytes and
simultaneously measure three oocytes exposed to differ-
ent or identical osmotic shifts. This chip was successfully
used to investigate the effect of CPA concentration on
oocyte membrane permeability, and it greatly improved
the measurement efficiency. Meanwhile, the adopted
neural network algorithm significantly enhances the data
processing efficiency. The results indicate that the per-
meability of the mouse oocyte membrane is positively
correlated with CPA concentration over a range of CPA
concentrations. In addition, this chip is easy to manu-
facture and is safe for oocyte developmental capacity. This
novel microfluidic chip approach has important applica-
tion prospects in fertility preservation, reproductive
medicine, and reproductive pharmacology.

plexes (COCs) were released from the ampullary region of
each oviduct using a 28-gauge needle. Then, the COCs
were incubated in DMEM containing 80 IU/mL hyalur-
onidase at 37°C for up to 3 min and further washed 3-4
times with DMEM to obtain clean oocytes. Oocytes were
then transferred and cultured in gamete buffer medium
(K-SIGB 50, Cook Medical, USA) at 37°C and 5% CO,
until further experimental use.

Design and fabrication of the microfluidic chip

The microfluidic chip mainly contains a concentration
gradient generation region and oocyte capture region. This
chip is fabricated using a photoresist mold protocol.
Briefly, to create the master mold, a negative photoresistor
(SU8 3035, Microchem, USA) is used to create the
structure of the microchannel via a lithography procedure
on a silicon wafer. It should be pointed out that a two-step
Chen et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:55

spin-coating and three-step exposure method was utilized.
After the mold was completed, polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS; Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Michigan, USA),
prepolymer, and curing agent (10:1) were poured onto the
aforementioned mold and cured at 78°C for ~3h. Then,
the chip was removed from the mold, and holes were
drilled. Finally, the chip was bonded to a glass slide for
experimental use.

Modeling and simulation of the microfluidic chip channels

To verify the reliability and practicability of the chip, a
FEM using COMSOL Multiphysics software was intro-
duced to simulate the microfluidic channel. The volume
controller of the model contains the continuous fluid in
the two parallel flow tubes, and their inlet and outlet align
with the microfluidic channel. FEM requires discretiza-
tion of the domain, so a user-controlled mesh (free tri-
angular) was utilized to solve this model.

When two or more fluids flow together in the micro-
channel, the fluid will flow forward side by side, and the
mass transfer will be carried out by diffusion under the
pressure or concentration difference. Therefore, the
concentration change model in the microfluidic channel
can be regarded as a laminar flow with the transport of
diluted species model. In the simulation, the single-phase
laminar flow can be calculated using the Navier—Stokes
equation (N-S equation), and the equation for the
incompressible flow is as follows*®:

pot + plu -Viu=V- [pl + (Vu + (vu)") +F
(1)
pV -u=0 (2)

Equation (1) represents the conservation of momentum
for incompressible laminar flow. The solution of the
equation is always solved together with Eq. (2), which is
known as the mass conservation equation. In the
equation, p represents the density of the fluid, 7
represents the dynamic viscosity, u denotes the fluid flow
rate, pl represents the X, Y, and Z axis pressures, and F
represents the external force acting on the fluid.

The channel wall boundary condition of the micro-
channel is set to no slip:

u=0 (3)

The boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the
microchannel are:

u = —uon (4)

where Uy represents the flow rate, and 1 represents the
normal unit vector. Two important parameters to

Page 10 of 12

consider before calculations are the viscosity and diffusion
coefficient of the solution. The CPA solutions that we use
are 1.5mol/L EG and PG, and via the Stokes—Einstein
equation (SE equation), we can find the diffusion
coefficient D,:

kT

D; =
67ryr

 

(5)

where 7 is the viscosity, kg is the Boltzmann constant, r is
the van der Waals radius of the solute molecule, and T is
the temperature.

The transport of diluted species means that the physical
properties such as the density and viscosity of the solution
do not change with the uneven distribution of the con-
centration. At both inlets, the boundary conditions of the
concentrations were set to 0.5 and 1.5mol/L. The
boundary condition of the outlet is set to be negligible
perpendicular to the boundary, i.e.,

—NX DV cj = 0 (6)

Oocyte perfusion experiment and data processing
DMEM solution was used as an isotonic solution, and
the CPA solutions of EG and PG were used with different
concentrations of 0.5 and 1.5 mol/L, separately. All solu-
tions were filtered beforehand to remove impurities.
Before the experiment, the most important step is to drain
out the bubbles from the channel because oocytes can be
constrained during the perfusion process, causing the
oocytes to be deformed and damaged. In addition, the
bubbles can affect the observation of certain parameters
during the experiment, such as volume change, which
cannot be observed. To drain out the bubbles, the flow
rate of the syringe pump was set as 30 uL/min to make the
isotonic solution fill the channel. After all bubbles were
eliminated, the oocytes in the syringe were loaded with a
hose, and then, oocytes were injected into microchannels
through the three cell inlets. When the oocytes were
captured by the microcolumn array in the three channels,
the CPA solution perfusion experiment was performed,
and the flow rate was 10 uL/min. There are also three
syringe pumps used to collect the waste solution. Here,
three different (Inletl: 1.5 M, Inlet2: 0.5 M) or identical
(Inlet1: 1.5 M, Inlet2: 1.5 M) osmotic shifts may be pro-
duced and applied to the oocytes captured in the channels
by introducing different combination of CPA solutions
from the two inlets. The microfluidic chip was placed
under an inverted microscope with an industrial camera
to view and record the whole oocyte capture region. The
experimental temperature was room temperature (23 °C).
To precisely and quickly process the experimental data,
a neural network method was adopted to analyze these
Chen et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:55

images*”*””°. Prior to using the neural network, datasets
for training should be made. In brief, each recorded video
was cut into three subvideos with 256 x 256 pixels, each
containing one oocyte. Then, the subvideo was converted
into a series of images, and partial images were selected for
further processing. These selected images manually circled
the shape of the oocyte membrane. To accurately measure
the permeability of the oocyte membrane, the oocyte
membrane manually circled only contains cytoplasm,
without zona pellucida. Then, the pixel values of the oocyte
and other positions in the image were set to 255 and 0,
respectively, to make a gray image as the output label of the
network. The theory and procedure of this neural network
approach are described in detail elsewhere*’*’. After pro-
cessing by the neural network, the obtained data were
calculated to obtain the oocyte volume value. Finally, the
normalized volume data were substituted into the 2-p
equation”', and the mouse oocyte membrane permeability
coefficient was obtained by fitting”’.

In vitro fertilization, embryo culture, and embryo transfer
For IVF, male KM mice older than 8 weeks were
euthanized by cervical dislocation, and sperm were col-
lected by dissecting the epididymis. The sperm were put
into 1mL of equilibrated sperm washing solution, the
epididymis tissue was removed, and the sperm were
incubated at 37 °C in 5% COs, air for 20—25 min to make
the sperm free swimming. Then, 10 uL of the above-
mentioned preliminarily incubated and well-dispersed
active sperm suspension was added to 50uL of equili-
brated washing solution and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5%
CO, and saturated humidity. Five oocytes were insemi-
nated with 2 x 10* sperm for ~5h in a 100-uL droplet of
fertilization medium (K-SIFM 50, Cook Medical, USA).
Subsequently, fertilized oocytes were selected for culture
in a drop of 50 uL of cleavage medium (K-SICM 50, Cook
Medical, USA) at 37°C in 5% COg. In the following days,
the development of the fertilized oocytes, that is, the
formation of 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and 16-cell embryos, was
monitored and recorded by optical microscopy.

Prior to embryo transfer, female mice (B6/CBA) were
copulated with vasectomized male mice as pseudopreg-
nant mice. Tubal embryo transfer (TET) was adopted to
implant 2-cell embryos. During surgery, the pseudopreg-
nant mice were anesthetized, the hair on the back of the
surgical area was removed, and a 10mm longitudinal
incision was cut. The ovaries, fallopian tubes and part of
the uterus were removed by routine operation. After
cutting the fallopian tube, the microtubule-containing
embryo was inserted into the incision, and the embryo
was injected. Subsequently, the ovary was gently pushed
into the body, and the wound was sutured. The mice were
kept warm after surgery until they woke up, waiting for
the birth of the baby mice.
