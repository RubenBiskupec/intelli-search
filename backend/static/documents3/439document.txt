incorporate physical features, e.g., the thickness ratio, that drive the complexity of the
mathematical model. In other words, NN can trigger fast informed decision-making on
the structural model to use and the influence of design parameters without the need of
modifying, rebuild, or rerun an FE model.

Introduction

Shell finite elements (FE) are standard options to model two-dimensional (2D) curved
structures. In commercial codes, shell FE have the assumptions of the classical theories
[1-3] leading to up to six degrees of freedom (DOF) per node. Such assumptions may be
too restrictive in the case of composite structures in which the high transverse deforma-
bility and the transverse anisotropy require the proper modeling of shear and normal
transverse stresses, and variations of the displacement field at the interface between two
layers with different mechanical properties, i.e., the Zig-Zag effect [4]. 3D FE can incor-
porate such effects but can lead to prohibitive computational costs due to severe aspect
ratio constraints. 2D FE remain computationally more efficient and attractive and, over
the years, many strategies emerged to extend their capabilities via, for instance, the use
of higher-order polynomial thickness expansions leading to increasing DOF per node
[5]. This paper presents a new methodology to assess shell FE for linear static analyses

of composites, and the following literature survey focuses on this specific area. More
comprehensive reviews are in [6-9].

Concerning the solution schemes, analytical and FE strategies are among the most used.
Analytical models received a great deal of interest as they provide very useful exact solu-
tions to, for instance, verify FE modelings. Such exact solutions can take into account the
shear deformability [10-16] or directly provide 3D solutions [17—23]. Research on refined
shell FE focused on higher-order models [24—26], the inclusion of transverse stretching
and continuity [27-29], and the development of solid-shell elements [30-37]. Regardless
of the solution scheme, the most important strategies to enhance the capabilities of shell
models are either asymptotic or axiomatic. The former exploit asymptotic expansions of
most relevant parameter, e.g., the thickness ratio, to build models with a priori known
accuracy as compared to 3D models [38-41]. The latter, on the other hand, build models
based on assumptions and, usually, less assumptions lead to more cumbersome models.
The axiomatic way has various directories starting from the improvement of classical
models [42—49]. As mentioned above, the proper modeling of the transverse behavior
of composites is decisive as proved by the efforts of many researchers over the past few
years. The focus is on improved modelings of the interlaminar stresses and through-
the-thickness continuity [50—55], shear correction factors [56], Zig-Zag models [57-61],
Layer-Wise (LW) models [62-65], and mixed formulations [66-68] allowing for the a
priori modeling of transverse stresses.

Another powerful approach is the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) method
[69,70] in which the construction of the refined model and the solution of the problem
take place simultaneously.

From the structural standpoint, the methodology in this paper adopts the Carrera
Unified Formulation (CUF) allowing to obtain any-order shell theory without formal
changes in the problem matrices [4,71,72]. One of the capabilities of CUF is the
axiomatic/asymptotic method (AAM) [73,74] to analyze the relevance of any general-
ized displacement variable. The systematic use of AAM leads to the definition of the Best
Theory Diagram (BTD), i-e., a 2D plot to localize shell models with minimum DOF and
maximum accuracies [75,76]. One of the aims of this paper is to reduce the computational
costs to obtain BTD via neural networks (NN). Such networks are mathematical mod-
els inspired by biological nervous systems and composed of simple computational units
interlinked by a system of connections [77] to learn through training via samples. In this
paper, CUF FE provides the samples for the supervised learning of multilayer perceptrons
to evaluate the accuracy of refined shell models avoiding FE matrices and analyses. The
use of NN in structural and material simulation is increasing due to the superior computa-
tional efficiency [78-80]. Recent applications for composites concern the prediction of the
elastic properties [81], buckling load [82,83], failure strength [84,85], natural frequencies
[86-88], and geometry optimization [89].

In this paper, “Finite element formulation” section provides a brief theoretical descrip-
tion of CUF and its FE formulation. “Best Theory Diagram” section introduces the concept
of BTD. “Neural networks and coding” section describes the use of NN to evaluate the
accuracy of a shell model. Results and conclusions are in “Results” and “Conclusions”

sections, respectively.

Best Theory Diagram

One of the CUF capabilities is the axiomatic/asymptotic method (AAM) to evaluate the
relevance of generalized variables and the accuracy of structural theories [73,74]. The
fourth-order, equivalent single layer shell model, is the reference model of this paper and
all the theories evaluated stem from the combinations of the full fourth-order expansion,
i.e., 2)° models. The CUF generates the governing equations for the theories considered. In
particular, the CUF generates reduced models having combinations of the starting terms
as generalized unknowns. Two parameters can identify a theory, namely, the number
of active terms and the error or accuracy provided. The Best Theory Diagram (BTD) is
the curve composed of all models providing the minimum error with the least number
of variables, see Fig. 3. Given the accuracy, models with fewer variables than those on
the BTD do not exist. Given the number of variables, models with better accuracy than
those on the BTD do not exist. In this paper, the error refers to the maximum transverse

The combined use of CUF and AAM allows the evaluation of the accuracy of any
finite element, as shown in Table 1. Black and white triangles indicate active and inactive
generalized displacement variables, respectively, and DOF the nodal degrees of freedom of
the element. N = 4 is the full expansion of fourth-order. Other three models, well-known

from literature, have incomplete expansions, namely,

Neural networks and coding
CUF FE analyses generate inputs to train NN. In this paper, the inputs are the structural
theories and the thickness ratio, and outputs are the maximum transverse displacements.

Figure 4 shows the two ways adopted in this paper to build the BTD, ie.,

¢ CUF generates the governing FE equations for all the shell theories stemming from
subsets of the fourth-order expansions. Given that the expansion has 15 terms, overall,
21° FE shell models are available. For instance, FSDT is one of these models in which
five terms are active—U, 1, Uy1, Uz], Ux2, and u,2—and ten inactive.

¢ The FE way runs 2!° static FE analyses and reports the error and number of active
terms of each case in a 2D plot.

¢ The NN way runs one-tenth of the FE analyses and uses them for training. Then, the

2D plot stems from querying the trained NN with all 2°° shell models.

¢ Ifa/hisa training variable, and, e.g., three a/h values are available, the overall number
of analyses is 3 x 2!°, and the query of the NN includes the shell model and the
thickness ratio.

The aim is to build the BTD with less than 2!° analyses and avoid new FE analyses as
the thickness ratio changes. In Fig. 4, the NN training set has 10% of all analyses as this is
a typical value used in this paper. Also, the figure shows only one hidden layer, although
more layers could be useful.

The NN configuration is a multilayer feed-forward with early stopping and mean
squared error as the objective function. Each layer has ten neurons. This paper adopts
Levenberg—Marquardt training functions [91]. The input coding is a vector with 16 ele-
ments, that is, all the fourth-order expansion generalized displacement variables and the
thickness ratio. Each generalized variable is either ‘1’ or ‘0’ to indicate its active or inactive
status. Each input has an associated output composed by a vector containing the error,
Eq. 14. As an example, the following equation shows the coded input of a generic shell
model with h/a = 0.1:

Ux = Ux, +ZUx, + ZA Ux.
Uy = Uy, + ZUy, + Z3 uy, => [1111110010101000.1] (18)
Uz = uz, + ZUz, + Zz? Uz,

Table 2 presents the computational costs of the various processes involved in this paper.

The cost normalization used the most expensive process as the reference. The number of
layers was chosen via a convergence analysis as the adoption of more than one layer led to

negligible increments of the computational cost. For the type of NN adopted here, the use
of 1-3 layers is a standard choice [91]. The data training generation used a random selec-
tion of the structural theories, and no significant variations in the results were observed
between different set of randomly chosen training sets.

Table 3 shows an overview of the analyses employed to obtain the BTD. In all cases,
the input is the structural theory. The capability of setting the theory as an input is a
feature provided by CUF. As mentioned in previous sections, CUF allows one to handle the
kinematics with no restrictions concerning the order and type of expansions adopted. Such
a capability is decisive to obtain the BTD as a tool to verify the accuracy of any structural
theory. In other words, via the BTD, the effect of the addition of a new generalized variable
can be estimated. As the structural theory to be verified is set, the FE option requires the
computation of the stiffness matrix and the solution of the linear static analysis. On the
other hand, the trained NN can provide the output by encoding the structural model.

The use of NN has the aim to overcome two current limitations of BTD. First, the
computational cost required can be very high as thousands of analyses are needed, and the
complexity of the problem increases. Then, the evaluation of the BTD becomes even more
challenging as various problem characteristics vary, e.g., boundary conditions or material

properties, and multiple outputs are considered, e.g., displacements and stresses. The use
of NN may be a solution to both issues. This paper aims to address the first limitation and
partially handling the second one. To address the second issue comprehensively, other NN
architectures are needed, e.g., convolutional NN as they can manage high-dimensional
input features with high efficiency [92].

Results

The numerical results focus on cases from [93]. The shell has a = b, Ry = Rg = Rand R/a
= 5. The load is bi-sinusoidal and applied on the top surface, p, = p, sin(zra/a) sin(z B/b).
The material properties are Ej /Ex = 25, Gyj2/E2 = Gj3/E2 = 0.5, G13/E2 = 0.2, v = 0.25.
The finite element model of a quarter of shell has a 4 x 4 mesh as this discretization
provides sufficiently accurate results [93]. In all cases, the BTD vertical axis ranges from
five to fifteen since models with four or less DOF provide very high errors and are not of
practical interest. The numerical results stemmed from two methodologies as follows:

The first numerical case refers to a simply-supported shell with symmetric lamination.
Table 4 shows the reference values of transverse displacements adopted to build the BTD.
The current N = 4 model provides good accuracy, although, for thicker shells, the match
with 3D solutions is not perfect. However, for the scope of the paper, its accuracy is
sufficient.

First, the analysis concerned the choice of the network parameters. Figures 5 and 6 show
the BTD from NN via 5 and 10 neurons and using 5% and 10% of the 2)” cases for training.
Table 5 presents some particular cases focused on structural theories from the literature.
The FE BTD serves as a benchmark. The results show that the use of 10 neurons and 10%
of cases provides very good matches. The remaining analyses made use of such network
architecture and focused on the effect of the thickness ratio on the BTD, given that, as
seen in previous papers like [76], this is the most relevant parameter to determine the
sets of most important generalized variables. Figure 7 shows the results for a/h = 100 in
which (a) reports the accuracy of all 2!” shell models as provided by the FE and by the

accuracy of models from the literature. For instance, ‘FSDT FE’, indicates the accuracy
of the first-order shear deformation theory as obtained via the FE model, whereas ‘FSDT
NN’ refers to the output of the trained NN. Figures 8 and 9 report the results of a/h =
50 and 10, respectively, and Table 6 presents the numerical values related to the models
from literature. The BTD models from NN are in Tables 7, 8 and 9. For instance, the six
DOF best model for a/h = 10 is the following:

Ux = Ux, +ZUx, + 2 Ux,
Uy = Uy, + Z Uy, (19)
Uz = Uz,

The last row of each table reports the relevance factor of the expansion orders (RF). The
RF is the ratio between the number of active instances and the total number of cases. For
instance, RFo = 1 indicates that the zeroth-order terms are always present in the BTD.
The combined information stemming from the previous figures and tables is in Figure 10

for a/h = 10 with the explicit indication of the seven, six, and five DOF best displacement
fields. The results suggest that

theories from the literature and the ability to cover the discontinuous error range
entirely.

The discontinuity in the error range, i.e., the presence of accuracy bands indicates
that there may not exist structural theories satisfying a given error requirement. As
shown in [76], such gaps widen as the thickness ratio increases. For thin shells, the
lower-order terms, i.e., the FSDT variables, play a decisive role, and their absence
causes high errors. As the shell is thicker, higher-order terms gain relevance leading
to more homogeneous error distributions.

There are no relevant differences in the BTD for a/h = 100 and 50 except that the
latter has a broader error range as the five DOF model, coinciding with the FSDT,
yields a 2% error. The models from the literature, although not always on the BTD
curve, provide satisfactory accuracies.

For a/h = 10, at least six DOF are necessary to have errors smaller than 1% and the
variables required to meet such a requirement are the cubic in-plane ones.

The analysis of the RF shows that, as well-known, for thin shells, zeroth- and first-
order variables are the most relevant. As the thickness increases, the third-order
terms gain importance with smaller relevance for first-order ones. The NN detected
very similar RF as compared to FE from [76], meaning that the prosed framework
can detect the accuracy of a given structural model and determine the models on the
BTD curve reliably.

Further analyses concerned the comparison of NN with linear regression (LR). LR is

computationally cheaper than NN and can provide explicit weights related to each training

The accuracy of LR is acceptable just in the second case but lower than NN.

0/90/0/90

The second numerical case investigated the effect of an asymmetric lamination on the
BTD. All other parameters remained as those of the previous case. Table 10 presents the
transverse displacement values with comparisons with other models from literature, when
available. Figures 13, 14 and 15 show the BTD from FE and NN, and Table 11 presents
the numerical values of the models from literature. For a/h = 50 and 10, the NN had three
layers of ten neurons as one layer was not enough to fit the BTD curve that, in these
cases, presents a more irregular shape than for a/h = 100. Tables 12, 13 and 14 show the
BTD models and relevance factors. Figure 16 shows the BTD curve for a/h = 10 and the
displacement field retrieved from Table 14. The results show that

¢« As mentioned, a more complex NN architecture was necessary, and the match
between FE and NN BTD is not perfect. Some differences are visible for higher DOF
models. However, such differences are still acceptable, given that, in the worst case,
remain within the 1% error range. The BTD curve presents various portions having
different shapes leading to a more difficult curve fitting.

¢ As in the previous case, a/h = 100 and 50 have similar BTD, and seven DOF are
enough to have very low errors with the FSDT providing accurate results.

¢ For a/h = 10, 11 DOF are necessary to have an error lower than 1% with full fourth-
order expansions for the in-plane terms. Besides linear terms, the third-order terms
are decisive for their absence leading to errors around 10%.

¢ The considered models from the literature provide high accuracy for thin shells. On
the other hand, for a/h = 10, only the TSDT can provide acceptable accuracy.

a/h as atraining variable

This section concerns the use of the thickness ratio as an additional training variable. The
aim is to show the possibility of using NN to test structural theories and obtain results as
the typical parameters of the structure change without the need of creating and running a
new FE analysis. In this section, the training inputs are 13, i.e., 12 generalized displacement

results refer to the two lamination schemes of the previous sections and a/h = 100, 50 and
10 were the training sets, i.e., the training set size was 10% of 3 x 217. a/h = 25 and 75 are
the thickness ratios evaluated via the trained NN. The BTD curves are in Figs. 17 and 18,
values from selected models are in Table 15, whereas the BTD models in Tables 16, 17, 18,

¢ There isa good match between the FE and NN results. Some differences are observable
for a/h = 25 but within the 1% error range at worst.

¢ a/h = 25 tends to have similar curves and BTD models of a/h = 10 with the increasing
relevance of third-order terms. Such a tendency may explain the better match of FE
and NN for thin shells given that the training used a/h = 100, 50, and 10. As seen
in the previous sections, the latter case tends to have BTD curves quite different as
compared to the first two cases.

¢ The trained NN provides outputs concerning models from the literature with good

Conclusions

This paper presented a new approach to evaluating the accuracy of shell models for com-
posites via the use of neural networks (NN). The NN training used results from shell finite
elements (FE) stemming from the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) and adopting a 15
DOF, fourth-order polynomial expansion along the thickness as the reference solution.
The first set of training inputs considered one-tenth of the combinations of active and
inactive terms, i.e., keeping the constant terms always active, one-tenth of 2’ shell theo-
ries. The second set of inputs added the thickness ratio as a further variable. In all cases,
the target was the maximum transverse displacement of a square, simply-supported shell
under bi-sinusoidal transverse load. The NN architecture ranged from one to three layers,

912

with ten neurons each. The result verification exploited the FE results of all 2°“ cases. The

NN provided the Best Theory Diagram (BTD), i.e., a curve giving the computationally
cheapest model for a given accuracy. The BTD permits to evaluate the accuracy of any
structural model and provides guidelines on the relevance of each generalized displace-
ment variable. The main findings of this paper are the following:

¢ The use of NN proved to be valid as matched very well the FE solutions. The main
convenience of NN is in the use of some 10% of FE analyses for training to obtain the
BTD and evaluate the accuracy of a structural model without the need for further FE
analyses.

¢ The NN training can incorporate physical features of the problems such as the thick-
ness ratio allowing to obtain results without the need of new FE analyses and prepro-
cessing.

¢ Potential critical aspects of this approach emerged as the training considered simul-
taneously thin and thick shells. Such a scenario required the use of more hidden layers

and needs further investigations.
Petrolo and Carrera Adv. Model. and Simul. in Eng. Sci.(2020)7:31

¢ The BTD stemming from the NN matched very well those obtained via FE and

presented in [76]. As well-known, the third-order in-plane terms are the most relevant
variables to include to refine classical theories.

¢ Most of the models from literature provides good accuracy, although increments in

thickness or asymmetric laminations can make such models inaccurate.

The combined use of CUF and NN is promising given that the former can provide

thousands of data sets in minutes and benchmarking for the rigorous assessment of results,

the latter can boost the computational efficiency and widen the applicability of virtual

modeling. Future investigations should focus on the use of NN for multiple targets, e.g.,

multi-point stress values, and inverse problems to establish the best model by inputting

the accuracy requirement.
