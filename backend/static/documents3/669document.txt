Abstract

Background: The explosive growth of social media has rendered them powerful communication channels. User
generated content is an important source of inspiration and influence among web friends, it generates new
activities and consequently affects mobility decisions. Whether to visit a place, or how to get to a place of interest
are decisions that can be triggered through people's interactions on social media.

Objective: The main objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of social media use on activity planning
and travel arrangements for women and men.

Methods: An online survey was conducted to examine the social media use and the impact of the shared content
for women and men, on the phase before any activity in an urban environment. Inferential statistics were applied
to detect gender differences in a sample size comprised of 804 respondents.

Result: The significant results showed that the variables gender and social media use for activity planning and

travel arrangements are associated with each other. Results have also indicated that the influence of reviews and
ratings, photos/ videos and proposed transport mode on activity planning is gender dependent. Photos/ videos
influence more often both women (m=3.47) and men (m=3.00) than reviews and ratings (m=3.21 for women and
2.94 for men). Both these contents influence more than proposed transport mode (m=2.62 and 2.37 for women
and men).

Conclusion: The analysis of the results indicated that before an activity, both women and men tend to use majorly
social media for activity planning and travel arrangements, while photos/videos influence women’s decisions more
often than men.Travel arrangements of the majority of resoondents would be influenced by a post of a designated
account related to transport. Finally, social media use affects travel arrangements of both women and men more
before performing an activity rather than during.

1 Introduction

Social media are considered as a major communications
channel for information exchange, opinion statement,
social network enabling, decisions influencing and busi-
ness promotion. Social networking affects the users’ per-
ceptions and choices regarding their activity planning.

The shared content is a valuable source of inspiration
and often affects the initial decision of activity plan-
ning [1, 2]. A mutual trust on choices is developed dur-
ing peoples’ interactions on social media, resulting in a
trigger for new activities [3]. Moreover, profiles of social
media users offer useful socio-economic and demo-
graphic information, creating potential for investigating
relationships between activity patterns and the charac-
teristics of the users [4—6].

Karatsoli and Nathanail European Transport Research Review

The increasing time being spent on social media and
the interactions with web friends and followers, have
changed dramatically the way that users perceive social
relationships. Social networking plays an important role
not only in broadening social connections but also affect-
ing users’ decisions [7]. Social media are used in ways that
shape the users’ travelling, entertainment and shopping
preferences, creating the need for them to participate in
activities shared by their web friends or by people they fol-
low. Despite the fact that social media allow a communi-
cation in which the physical presence is not necessary,
reviews, photos, and videos shared via them motivate
users to visit a place, attend an event or buy a product.
The instantaneous and real-time access to relevant tips
and guides, travelling instructions, specific offers and dis-
counts or inspirational photos/videos has ultimately chan-
ged the way users plan an activity [8, 9].

According to literature, gender may affect the way that
people share information on social media and the way
they use it to make decisions [10—12]. However, an ex-
tended literature review in this study, revealed that there
are no published studies that have examined the gender
differences of social media use for activities and travel
choices. To address this gap, this study aims at explain-
ing gender differences in social media use for activity
planning and travel arrangements, before an activity. As
Dwityas and Briandana [13] stated in their research, be-
fore an activity, social media content such as photos,
videos or text, influence the user by creating the need to
perform a shared activity. Furthermore, the user collects
information regarding the activity, such as activity type,
destination, instructions to reach the destination, public
transport timetable, reviews and ratings, looks for infor-
mation about activities performed by others and visits
the appropriate social media accounts to get precise data
as a basis for right decision-making.

Acknowledging the amount of shared information on
social media platforms today and the current growth
rate of social media users, the present work focuses on
the phase before any activity in an urban environment,
examining the social media use and the impact of the
shared content for women and men. The work is struc-
tured as follows. Section 2 presents a summary of previ-
ous studies that have focused on the relationships
among social media platforms, travel behavior and activ-
ity planning, focusing on studies that reports differences
between women and men. Section 3 describes the survey
design and communication, while indicates the analyses
methods adopted. Section 4 reports the results. Finally,
section 5 discusses the findings and concludes the study.

mobility decisions by setting a new framework for travel
behavior. Xiang and Gretzel [14] were among the first
that reported the importance of social media in seeking
travel information. The goal of their study was to inves-
tigate the extent to which social media appear in search
engine results in the context of travel-related engines.
The analysis showed that social media constitute a sub-
stantial part of the search results, indicating that search
engines direct travelers to social media sites. Yoo and
Gretzel [15] in their study, identified social media as an
important source of information for travelers, the major-
ity of whom trust their content. The results of their sur-
vey indicated that travelers’ personality influences
perceived barriers to content creation and engagement
in generated content creation. Gao, Tang, and Liu [16]
explored the role of social association in users’ check-ins
in order to improve the accuracy of activity’s location
prediction. A social-historical model was used to inte-
grate social ties and historical ties. The results showed
that users who sustain a level of friendship tend to go to
similar locations. A year later, Ayeh, Au, and Law [17]
investigated the factors that affect the intention to use
social media for specific purposes of travel planning.
Through an online survey, they proved that among indi-
viduals with Internet access who take often vacation
trips, mostly young people use social media to plan their
trips. In this direction, Schroeder and Penninghton-Gray
[18] used linear regression to explore the relationships
of variables with the likelihood of social media use to
seek information in the event of a crisis during travel.
Results showed that those who travel frequently use so-
cial media to get information in the event of a crisis dur-
ing their trip more often than those who travel less.
More recent studies as of Varghese and Jana [19] fo-
cused on exploring the potential of information and
communication technologies (ICT) to improve access to
opportunities. The data showcased the differences in
household socio-economic characteristics, individual
personal characteristics, ICT use patterns, activity par-
ticipation, and time allocation patterns, drawing conclu-
sions about the interrelationships between ICT, social
disadvantage, and activity participation. Lee and Circella
[20] attempted to understand the relationships of ICT
use and travel outcomes among millennials, by cluster-
ing them in intense users, moderate users, and light
users, however, no conclusions were drawn about how
the use of ICT affect their travel choices. Finally, Jamal
and Habib [21] explored the covariates that affect the
use of smartphones for trip planning as well as the co-
variates of perceived impact of smartphone use on travel
outcomes. One of their main outcomes was that millen-
nials are more likely to use smartphones for trip plan-
ning as well as perceive increase in travel outcomes due
to smartphone use.
Karatsoli and Nathanail European Transport Research Review

As per differences between women and men in online
activities and use of information technology, Park and
Lee [22] conducted an online survey to investigate gen-
der differences in smartphone application use. Results
revealed that women found more useful the smartphone
text communications to keep strong their personal rela-
tionships as compared to men. Idemudia, Raisinghani,
Adeola, and Achebo [23] used confirmatory factor ana-
lysis and structural equation modeling to analyze 290
datasets from college students. Their results indicated
that women had stronger perception of ease of use,
compatibility, relative advantage, and risk when using
social media when compared to men. More recent stud-
ies, as the one of Lin and Wang [12] aimed at explaining
the gender differences in information-sharing behavior
on social networking sites. To achieve this, a compara-
tive theoretical model of information sharing between
genders was developed. In line with previous studies, re-
sults showed that privacy risk, social ties, and commit-
ment are more important for women than men, as
attitude towards information sharing, affects people’s
intention to share information more strongly for women
than it does for men. Another recent study by Twenge
and Martin [24] attempted to investigate gender differ-
ences in the use of social media by examining 13- to 18-
year-old adolescents in the U.S. and UK. Results showed
that adolescent girls spent more time on smartphones,
social media, texting, general computer use as compared
to boys, however, no further investigation was made
about how much of this time was spent to plan an
activity.

3 Methodology

3.1 Survey design

An online survey in the English language was hosted on
Survey Monkey to investigate the influence of social
media use in activity planning and travel arrangements.
In the context of the survey, the term “activity planning”
is used to describe the preparatory actions and set of
conditions in order to perform an activity, such as going
to a restaurant, visiting a museum, participating in an
outdoor yoga class, visiting a doctor or going to a shop-
ping mall. Such preparatory actions include decisions
about which activity to do next, who to do the activity
with, always based on information concerning reviews
and ratings, photos and videos of alternative destina-
tions, as shared by previous visitors on social media. The
term “travel arrangements” refers to decisions on how to
reach the selected destination, and specifically departure
time, mode of travel, route, ticket purchasing and other.
In particular, this survey focused on the influence of in-
formation or advices for using a specific transport mode
to reach the destination, as most social media accounts
of businesses, events etc. include in their description the
proposed transport mode to reach the location. In
addition, social media friends share or propose a trans-
port mode to reach a destination of an activity either
based on their own experience or knowledge.

The questionnaire consisted of four parts. The first
part recorded the socio-economic characteristics of the
respondents, by collecting personal information such as
gender, age, education level, employment status, etc.
The second part referred to the use of social media, in

which collected data regarded the most preferable social
media platform, the time, frequency and duration of so-
cial media use. The third and fourth parts constitute the
main core of the survey, highlighting the influence of so-
cial media as stated by the respondents. In particular,
the third part examined whether reviews and ratings,
photos/videos and proposed transport mode affect “ac-
tivity planning” and “travel arrangements” (categorical
variables), and the degree of such influence (ordinal vari-
ables) (Table 1). It also investigated the post type that
would mostly affect decisions, such as a post by a fam-
ous person, a sponsored post or a post by a designated
account related to transport. Furthermore, the fourth
part collected the impact of social media use, in terms of
frequency of travel arrangements changes before and
during an activity (Table 2).

3.2 Survey communication

The online survey was targeted to social media users
across the world. Social media users were reached
through email and posting on first author’s Instagram
and Facebook accounts. As a first step, emails were sent
to 3436 contacts of Traffic, Transportation and Logistics
(TTLog) laboratory of University of Thessaly contact list
comprised of research institutions, ministries, municipal-
ities, associations, groups, companies, actions, projects
and postgraduate students around the world. The emails
were sent from the email account of TTLog laboratory.
As a second step, the questionnaire link was shared on
first author’s personal social media accounts. The link of
the questionnaire was active from January 2018 and
remained opened till January 2019. Along with the invi-
tation to participate, information about the purpose and
the design of the survey were sent. The participants were
chosen by chance without any specific screening process
during the recruitment period. The final sample size
comprised 888 users, who fully completed the question-
naire. However, as the aim of the study dictates, the ana-
lysis was made based on the 91% of the respondents,
who use social media.

3.3 Sample characteristics and social media use

Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate socio-
demographic and general characteristics of the 804 re-
spondents. Table 3 summarizes the socio-demographic
and general characteristics of the respondents. Analytic-
ally, 61% of them are women and the rest 39% are men.
Most of the respondents belong to the age groups of

18-25 years old (38% of the respondents) and 26-35
years old (36% of the respondents). In addition, 38% of
the survey respondents are students and 51% have a full-
time job. Most of them hold a driver’s license (76%),
whereas they use public transport from seldom to often
(74%).

In a multiple choices question about which social
media is used, Facebook and Instagram are the mostly
used platforms for both women (57% use Facebook and
53% use Instagram) and men (33% use Facebook and
21% Instagram). Twenty percent of men are also inter-
ested in job-related social media such as LinkedIn, while
25% of women are more interested in inspirational

participants were also asked about the time of the day
that they most frequently use social media. The majority
of users (66% split in 41% women and 25% men) use so-
cial media between 17:00—00:00.

3.4 Data analysis

The analysis of the data was done through descriptive
and inferential statistics. In the first case, sample charac-
teristics, such as age, gender and occupation were ad-
dressed by estimating the frequency distribution per
characteristic (paragraph 3.3). Furthermore, the mean
values and standard deviations, and medians were calcu-
lated. In the second case, the statistical analysis of the
responses was carried out using non-parametric tests
which are regarded as particularly powerful for analyzing
data collected through questionnaire surveys [25, 26].
Specifically, chi-square test for homogeneity (x7 test) was
used to test differences in characteristics measured by
categorical variables. In total, two variables that refer to
social media use for activity planning and travel arrange-
ments (Table 2), three variables that are related to the
influence of social media content on activity planning,
and the responses of variable “type of post that would
mostly affect users’ travel arrangements” were compared
through chi-square (x*) tests in order to detect any dif-
ferences between the two genders. Furthermore, the
Mann-Whitney two-sample U-test was performed to as-
sess differences between the two genders of ordinal vari-
ables measured on the 5-point scale (1: never, 2: seldom,
3: sometimes, 4: often, 5: always). This scale was used as
it increases the variance in the measurements and allows
a greater differentiation in the results [27].

3.5 Research limitations

This study may entail limitations related to the sample
used. Due to authors’ nationality, the majority of the re-
spondents (70%) are from Greece. In addition, 74% of
the respondents belong to young age groups (18-35
years old), as they are more familiar with technology and
social media use. After a thorough research on global re-
lated figures, the authors concluded that this does not
affect the present research’s validity. Both sample’s age
distribution and social media usage are in line with the
global population age distribution, initially documented
in US Census Bureau [28] and in Martin, Hamilton,

(2020) 12:44

Page 5 of 9

Osterman, Driscoll, and Births [29] for US, and sup-
ported worldwide by Ferrer [30] and world social media
users per age group [31, 32]. Also, all participating coun-
tries share similar social media usage [33]. In any case,
only gender related comparisons were included in this
analysis.

Another possible limitation of the study could be the
abstract understanding of the term “social media use” by
the respondents. However, this particular study investi-
gated social media use only related to information
searching, which was explicitly stated in the respective
questions of the questionnaire and not for any other rea-
son that social media could be used and could confuse
respondents.

4 Results

The following sections discuss the gender differences in
social media use for planning an activity and for making
travel arrangements, the degree of influence depending
on the social media means and content.

4.1 Reasons for social media use before an activity

The frequency of social media use for activity planning
and travel arrangements were examined. Table 4 shows
the proportion of Women’s (W) and Men’s (M) positive
responses applied to social media use for activity plan-
ning and travel arrangements. Both genders indicate
interest in receiving information from social media,
more when planning an activity (94.5% for women and
87% for men) as compared to making travel arrange-
ments (76.4% for women and 53.4% for men). Moreover,
the responses were compared through chi-square (x”)
tests in order to detect any effect of the gender on social
media use. The fifth column of the table contains the
test p-values that indicate the strength of the respective
evidence. In this case, the p-values are smaller than 0.05,
thus, the null hypothesis that asserts the two variables
are independent of each other is rejected. The significant
results show that the variables gender and social media
use for activity planning and travel arrangements are as-
sociated with each other. Results showed that the per-
centages of positive responses of women are higher than
men for both examined variables and the differences
were Statistically significant (p-value< 0.05). This finding
indicates that women are keener than men on reaching

out for information provided by social media. In the
variable “Use of social media for travel arrangements”,
the large chi-square statistic (45.006) and its small sig-
nificance level (p < 0.05) indicate that it is very likely that
these variables are dependent of each other. Thus, it is
concluded that there is a relationship between gender
and use of social media for travel arrangements.

4.2 Influence of social media content on activity planning
The gender effect on the influence of social media con-
tent on activity planning was examined through three
chi-square (x’) tests; one related to reviews and ratings,
the second, to photos/videos and the last, to a proposed
transport mode. The proportion of positive responses
applied to the examined variables, by Women (W) and
Men (M), are shown in Table 5. In all examined cases of
social media content, respondents indicated influence on
activity planning. Photos/videos seem to be slightly more
influential (92.8% of women and 85.6% of men) than re-
views and ratings (92.2% of women and 84.9% of men).
Proposed transport mode by social media influences less
than the previous contents, however, still in high pro-
portions in both women (85.5%) and men (75.7%). The
fifth column of Table 5 contains the test p- values that
indicate the strength of the evidence of the effect of gen-
der on social media content. Results showed that statisti-
cally significant differences were observed in all three
variables. The significant results indicate that the influ-
ence of reviews and ratings, photos/ videos and pro-
posed transport mode on _ activity planning are
associated with gender. This finding is reasonable and
supports the previous results, according to which

women are more receptive to the information provided
by social media.

For the same variables, the participants were asked to
rate on a 1—5 scale (1: never, 2: seldom, 3: sometimes, 4:
often, 5: always) the frequency that social media use af-
fects activity planning. Table 6 presents an overview of the
average values (m), medians (mdn) and standard devia-
tions (sd) of the three variables and the test results of the
gender effect on the attributed ratings. Results are de-
scribed through Mann-Whitney U statistic and p-value,
indicating the strength of the respective evidence. Statisti-
cally significant differences between women and men were
reported in all the examined variables. Table 6 shows that
women rate higher than men all three contents (p-value<
0.05). Photos/ videos influence more often both women
(m = 3.47) and men (m=3.00) than reviews and ratings
(m = 3.21 for women and 2.94 for men). Both these con-
tents influence more than proposed transport mode (m =
2.62 and 2.37 for women and men). It is concluded that
social media content is more influential when providing
visual information or feedback based on experience and
less when the information is more formal, as in the case of
a proposed transport mode.

4.3 Influence of social media post on travel arrangements
This section includes the analysis of the responses that
focused on the investigation of the influence of social
media post on travel arrangements, as an engaging con-
tent affects peoples’ mobility decisions. Specifically, par-
ticipants were asked what would mostly affect their
travel arrangements, see Table 7. The p-value (0.051) is
larger than 0.05 and consequently there is not enough

evidence to conclude that the gender and type of post
that would affect travel arrangements are associated.
The majority of the participants answered that a post by
a designated account related to transport would affect
the most their arrangements. The potential of social
media as means for sharing transport information has
been already indicated in research [34]. Respondents
pointed out that the account behind social media post
plays an important role on final decision regarding travel
arrangements and is independent of gender. In general,
social media users hardy trust information if they don’t
know where it comes from. A sponsored post is harder
to affect travel arrangements, since social media users
are more skeptical about the transparency and credibility
of such content. Hence, it is a challenge to discern if the
information is reliable or simply an advertisement [35].
Results of a previous study showed that women are
more inclined to trust the content on social media, per-
ceiving information from others as more trustworthy
than men [36].

Furthermore, the participants were asked to select up
to three most appealing approaches of this transport re-
lated post, from a given list of approaches, see Fig. 1. Re-
sults showed that an informative or a humorous post
would be more appealing for both genders compared to
an emotional, encouraging, confronting or hard socking/
fear post. These findings are in line with previous litera-
ture in which the shortcomings of a fear-based messages

4.4 Comparison of social media use before and during an
activity

Based on the Travel Decision Making Model [39], and
its adaptation by Dwityas and Briandana [13], users
could be affected both before and during an activity. So-
cial media content can cause changes to users’ travel ar-
rangements before and during the activity occurrence.
Table 8 presents an overview of the average rating and
standard deviation of the two variables and the test re-
sults of the comparisons between men and women. Re-
sults are described through U and p-value. Social media
use affects the travel arrangements of both genders be-
fore and during an activity with almost the same fre-
quency (before: m=3.48 for women, m=3.5 for men,
during: m = 2.86 for women, m = 2.84 for men). Changes
to travel arrangements after social media use before an
activity can occur more often for both women (m = 3.48)
and men (m=3.50) than during an activity (m = 2.86
and m = 2.84 for women and men). Changes to travel ar-
rangements during the activity occurrence may happen
due to changes in public transport timetable, unpredict-
able events, or changes of next activity’s plans, hence, it

her final decision. As Dwityas and Briandana [13] stated
in their research, before an activity the user collects
plenty of information regarding the activity and gets a
precise set of data as a basis for right decision-making.

5 Concluding discussion

During the last years there has been an increased usage
of social media platforms when planning an activity
which denotes the high intrusion rates of such platforms
in our social lives. Decisions of almost nine out of ten
individuals who use social media are affected on “what
to do” (activity plans), while almost 75% of women and
50% of men are affected on “how to do it” (travel ar-
rangements of the activity). Moreover, the significant re-
sults showed that the variables gender and social media
use for activity planning and travel arrangements are as-
sociated with each other. Results have also indicated that
the influence of reviews and ratings, photos/ videos and
proposed transport mode on activity planning is gender
dependent. Consistent with previous studies, women are
affected at a higher degree than men and are more re-
ceptive to the information provided by social media.
Specifically, women reported that social media content
such as reviews and ratings, often affect their activity
planning decisions.

Travel arrangements of the majority of respondents
would be influenced by a post of a designated account
related to transport. This finding is in line with previous
studies, which showed that users trust in social media
content is strongly related to who shares it and they are
willing to share this information to others if it comes
from an account they trust. Another useful conclusion
stemming from this research, was that social media users
selected informative transport related messages over
other appealing approaches, when they are asked about
the type of content that would mostly affect their travel
choices. Although shocking related content is believed
to have greater impact on getting our attention, inform-
ative messages seem to establish a high-quality level of
information shared on social media platforms, which
could help transport authorities and decisions makers to
adopt effective policies and promote awareness cam-
paigns towards sustainable mobility.

Finally, social media use affects travel arrangements of
both women and men more before performing an

activity rather than during. However, this is believed to
change shortly, as usage rates of smart phones coupled
with rich applications and mobile data services are in-
creasing, allowing us staying more connected.

Future work should investigate how the impact of
social media on mobility decisions is affected by other
factors such as the trip purpose and the commuter
type. A recommended framework to set up a cam-
paign or to share transport related information on so-
cial media towards sustainable urban mobility is of
great importance. Focus should be given on a stra-
tegical approach for social media use in producing a
reliable network of communication with users about
their daily trips. A challenge of using social media as
a supporting tool is the constant development of
them, which requires staying abreast of every new
change. Privacy concerns continue to be a threat to
social media use, and it is still unknown to what ex-
tend and how these security issues will affect the way
that people use social media. Moreover, a clear un-
derstanding of gender differences on _ users’
information-sharing behavior could contribute in pro-
moting travel services more efficiently.
