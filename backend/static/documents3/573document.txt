ABSTRACT

This paper discusses various aspects of a single-ended primary inductance
DC-DC converter (SEPIC). The focus is on design, modelling, and
simulation results of a SEPIC converter. The study analyses the principle of
SEPIC operation when operated in continuous conduction mode (CCM).
Additionally, the mathematical equations for the design modules are
calculated as per converter requirements. State-space equations are used to
formulate the state-space model of the SEPIC converter. To satisfy the best-
performance criterion of the system, the parameters for controller (Kp, Ki,
Ka) should be tuned or optimized using the genetic algorithm (GA)
optimization technique. Controller parameters are determined using an
objective function that minimises the integral time absolute error (ITAE).

Simulations performed on a closed-loop system reveal that the step response
with a PID controlled based GA displayed superior performance. A closed-
loop system has a substantially bigger stability region compared to an open-
loop system. The simulation optimised performance metrics like maximum
overshoot percentage (Mp), rise time (tr), and settling time (ts).
MATLAB/Simulink R2018a® and m-file code are used for the system
modelling, simulation, and optimization of the PID controller parameters
based on the GA.

1. INTRODUCTION

The power shortage relative to the cumulative demand for load is considered to be a major problem
in many countries where it has become impossible to generate sufficient energy using traditional means.
These difficult situations have led researchers to focus on finding alternative ways to generate energy [1, 2].
Power electronic converters such as DC-DC converters (sometimes called switching regulators) are primarily
implemented to improve energy conversion efficiency when extracting electric power [3]. DC-DC converters
are circuits which typically supply a constant output and convert DC voltage to a different voltage level.
These are used for obtaining stabilized or changing DC voltage(s) by increasing, decreasing, or multiplexing
from any DC source [4, 5].

There are two types of DC-DC converters, isolated and non-isolated. Flyback and forward
converters are variants of isolated DC-DC converters [6]. These use a high-frequency transformer to place an
electrical barrier and isolate both the input and output of these converters. A significant advantage of isolated
converters is that they protect sensitive loads [7]. On the other hand, non-isolated DC-DC converters have no

such electrical barrier. Some examples of non-isolated converters are buck-boost converter, buck, boost,
CUK, ZETA, and SEPIC converters [8, 9]. Non-isolated DC-DC converters are cost-effective and easy to
design when compared to their isolated counterparts.

The converters have diverse applications in electric traction, electric vehicles, distributed-DC
systems like space applications, ships, and airplanes [10, 11]. Solar photovoltaic and specialised electrical
machine drives are other areas where the converters are useful [12, 13]. Different systems have specific
requirements and the DC-DC converter used for the applications should be carefully chosen to have a high-
efficiency system with excellent power quality [14]. This paper focuses on the single-ended primary-
inductance DC-DC Converter (SEPIC). The SEPIC converter is able to reduce or raise the electrical potential
(voltage) at the output and can be considered as a buck/boost converter [12]. Additionally, the SEPIC DC-DC
converter is also capable of producing a regulated positive output voltage for any input voltage. This is in
contrast to other converters like CUK or ZETA that provide a negative regulated output voltage [15-17]. The
structure of the paper is specified as follows: introduction, principle of operation of the SEPIC converter,
state-space modelling for the SEPIC converter, parameters and design components required for the converter,
MATLAB simulations and modelling the SEPIC converter, genetic algorithm to optimise the PID parameters
to control the SEPIC converter, results from the simulation, and discussion.

2. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF SEPIC CONVERTER

The operating principle for a SEPIC DC-DC converter used in continuous conduction mode (CCM)
is described in Figure 1. The diagram shows an input voltage source (Vs), a couple of inductors (L; and Lz), a
coupling capacitor (C;) that is connected to the inductors to ensure that a current path exists for the DC flow
and to also provide insulation [14], power diode (Dj), output filter capacitor (C2), and a switching device.
Usually, the switching device is an insulated gate bipolar transistor (GBT) labelled (S;). The load resistance
of the circuit (R) is also shown.

The SEPIC converter has two operating modes: one is the CCM, the other is the discontinuous
conduction mode (DCM). In this paper, the first mode is considered to have two states, which can be
described as follows.

2.1. SEPIC converter operating modes
2.1.1.State 1 (0<t<D)

When S1 is switched ON, the current I; increases. Current flowing through the second inductor I;2
also increases but in the negative direction. The energy stored in the first inductor L; increases. Therefore,
capacitor C; supplies energy to increase the current in I_2. SEPIC converter operation mode with switch S;
ON is shown in Figure 2.

2.3. Component design of SEPIC DC-DC converter

It is necessary that the selection of the main components in the converter design improve the output
power efficiency without increasing cost, especially in high-volume power electronic applications. Based on
the above, this section of paper focuses on choosing components and deriving their mathematical expressions
when designing a SEPIC DC-DC converter to meet the requirements tabulated in 1.

2.3.1.Component design of SEPIC DC-DC converter

The principle of volt-second balance takes into account the voltage drops at diode (Dj), Le.
according states to the volt-second balance for a converter operating in a steady state, the average voltage
during one switching cycle of the inductor must be zero [16]. Firstly, the voltage can be seen by L; during
interval (0 < t < Dr) equals to (VLi=Vs), while, during the interval (Dr < t < T), it equals (VLi=Vs-Vci-Vp-
Vo). Taking the average over the entire interval and making it equal to zero, equation (19) can be obtained as:

1 T 1 ;DT T
T (J, Visdt) = T J Vs dt + Sor Vs —_ Vex —_ Vp —_ Vo)dt| = 0 (19)
Finding the integral and rearranging the above equations yields equation (20)
V
Vex + Vp + Vo = = (20)

Similarly, by taking the volt- second balance for L2. Hence, the voltage can be seen by L» during
interval (0 < t < Dr) is equal to (Vi2=Vci), while during the interval (Dr < t < T), the voltage is equal to
Vi2=-VotVp which gives (21).

1 T 1 DT T

Ver + Vo + Vp = 2 (22)

By combining (20) and (22), the transfer ratio or voltage gain (G) of the SEPIC converter in terms
of (D) can be obtained as shown in (23).

_ VotVp _ D

G (23)

The value of (G) can be greater than or less than one, depending on the value of the duty cycle (D).

2.3.2.Calculation of minimum and maximum duty cycle
Depending on the voltage gain in equation (23), the minimum duty cycle (Dyin) occurs when the
input voltage is at a maximum value (V5 7g) and it can be expressed as shown in (24).

However, the maximum duty cycle (D,,q,) may occur when the input voltage is at a minimum value
(Vs min), aS given in (25).

2.3.3.Inductor Li and L2 selection

In switch mode power supply (SMPS), the main function of the inductors is to store energy in their
magnetic field and attempt to maintain a constant current, or equivalently, to limit the rate of change in
current flow to the output. Selecting an inductor is necessary to the overall design of a converter. Normally,
the inductance value of a converter should be set to limit the peak-to-peak ripple current flowing to the
output. The inductance value that satisfied the requirements in the design of the SEPIC converter was
estimated by rearranging (1), presented in the previous section, and substituting (di, = Al,, dt = DT,

T= =). to yield (26).

2.3.4. Coupling capacitor Ci selection

Capacitors have several functions in SMPS design, such as energy storage, filtering, compensation,
etc. Typically, SMPS stages, the capacitance stores energy as an electric field due to the voltage applied and
attempts to maintain a constant input and output voltage. To calculate the optimal value of (C,) in the SEPIC
converter circuit shown in Figure 1 with an acceptable level of voltage ripple to satisfy the requirements and
stability of the converter, the capacitance formula shown in (27) was used.

_ 40
c= 42 (27)

Equation (27) can then be rewritten, as the change in voltage is proportional to the change in charge
over its capacitance, which yields (28).

Thus, (29) is substituted into (28) to determine the value of input capacitor (C,) as shown in (30).
Hence, it should be noted that (C,) is charged by (I,2 = Iomax) during the time interval (0 <t< DT).

2.3.5. Output capacitor C2 selection

Where Dyin, Dmax are the maximum and minimum duty cycles respectively ,VomaxVs min are

and switching frequency (f[) are applied, it may be expressed as approximately (Al,=20% *Tin max). 4Vc1;
AV-z are the peak-to-peak voltage ripples in volts at capacitors C, and Cz, respectively. The acceptable
percentage value of ripple voltage used in this paper is (AV-,= 1% *V¢5 min and AV~2=1% *Vo).

2.4. Matlab simulation of SEPIC DC-DC converter

The open loop SEPIC DC-DC converter was implemented using the MATLAB® simulation
platform R2018b Simulink [18]. For the purpose of simulation, the components of the SEPIC converter and
their values tabulated in the Table | depend on the equations derived in pervious sections.

2.5. Genetic algorithm (GA)

GAs are stochastic global search engines that simulate the creation of natural processes. A GA starts
with an initial population of chromosomes, each of which represents a possible solution to the problem, and
the reliability of the chromosomes is evaluated by a fitness function (FF) [19, 20]. The GA consists of three
main steps: mutation, crossover and selection [21]. GAs are used to determine the representation of the
chromosomes that are created by three values corresponding to the gains or parameters of the PID controller
(K,, Ki, Kq ) that have been modified to attain a desired behavior [22]-[24]. The (K,, K;, Kg) gains are real
numbers, which are to be measured individually. The equation for the PID controller is shown as (35) [25]. In
this study, the integral time absolute error (ITAE) is taken as the objective function, given as (36). The
reciprocal of the objective function is called FF. The FF is the measurement of the chromosome’s quality.

G.(s) =Ky++Kgs (35)
ITAE = f° tl e(t)ldt (36)

Where K,, is the proportional gain, K; is the integral time, Kg is the derivative time, e (t) is the error-

controlling signal = 1— y(t) and y(t) is the tuned control system step response. Figure 4 shows a flowchart for
GA. The parameters of the GA are listed in Table 2.

converter can be seen in Figure 5. The reference signal or set point R(s) is input as the desired voltage and is
compared with the actual value of the output voltage Y(s) for the SEPIC converter. The error signal E(s) is
given as the input signal to the PID controller after its parameters are tuned using GA technique. The output
signal generated by the PID controller U(s) is used as the input signal to control the suitable range of duty
cycle (D) in a suitable range for the SEPIC converter, and the required output voltage is then obtained [26].

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

MATLAB® R2018b Simulink software was used to simulate the SEPIC DC-DC converter and
verify its performance. Figure 6 (a) shows the step response of the open-loop transfer function for the SEPIC
DC-DC converter without the PID controller. It is observed that the response matches the step response for a
second-order system. However, the maximum overshoot percentage (close to 73%) is higher than that of the
second-order system. Slow rise and settling times are also observed. Figure 6 (b) depicts the closed-loop step
response for a GA optimised PID controller. The PID controller parameters (K,,K;,Kq) are set to their
optimal value using the GA technique. This technique helps minimise the objective function (ITAE) and the
optimisation process depends on the code specified in the MATLAB m-file. Table 3 specifies the
optimisation criteria and the performance characteristics for the step response like (M,, t,., ts).

4. CONCLUSION

This paper presents design, modelling and simulation of controlled SEPIC DC-DC converter-based
GA. The study comprised the mathematical model, state-space modelling, design components, simulation,
and analysis of the SEPIC DC-DC converter. MATLAB R2018b SIMULINK was used to carry out the
simulations. The SEPIC DC-DC converter is a time-invariant, linear system of the fourth order. A PID
controller was utilised to change the output of the SEPIC converter to optimise the values of the performance
parameters. PID controller parameters K,, Ki, Ka were manipulated using the GA technique to determine
their optimal values intelligently. Optimisation was performed with ITAE serving as the fitness function. The
results of the simulation and the study indicate that the closed-loop step response system performed best in
conjunction with a PID controller with optimised parameters. Maximum overshoot percentage rise and
settling times were optimised. Additionally, the GA-PID controller was more accurate and better sensitivity
against disturbances when compared to using it without the PID controller.
