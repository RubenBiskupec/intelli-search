Traditional competitive human resource allocation is no longer suitable for contemporary requirements. To improve
the effectiveness of human resource management and the degree of matching between jobs and staffs, we propose a
novel auto-encoder neural network-based method in the cloud environment, which is a semi-automatic manner in the
business process of human resource allocation. The proposed method is based on deep learning architecture by using
appropriate cloud resources and takes into account the similarities and deep presentation between staff modules.
The construction between human resource network is combined with a priori information about the human resource

and set up by the evaluation index system of human resource planning. Our proposed method enables the modeling
of semi-automatic human resource allocation process and can be used to facilitate optimized human resource
allocation. Experimental results show that our method can bring significant improvements to personnel position
matching and effectively enhance the efficiency of human resource allocation based on the cloud environment.

1 Introduction

Human resource is an important factor that affects the
survival and development of an enterprise in contem-
porary competitive business environments [1]. The allo-
cation of human resources aims to improve the match-
ing degree between personnel and positions. The human
resource allocation directly affects the overall utilization
efficiency of other resources in an enterprise [2]. Effec-
tive allocation of human resources is a key factor that
determines whether an enterprise can sustain, stabilize,
and develop rapidly. Accurate prediction of the required
human resource for modern enterprises can help the
enterprises find out whether the personnel positions are
insufficient or too many, which will provide accurate
guidance for rational allocation of human resources that

has far-reaching significance for the sustainable devel-
opment of enterprises [3]. By the convenience of using
cloud computing resources, the proper allocation of enter-
prise human resources will contribute to the formation of
meaningful economic activities and, thus, greatly improve
the productivity of human resources [4]. The ultimate
goal of enterprise human resource allocation is to improve
the overall operating efficiency and create more economic
and social benefits for enterprises. Therefore, nowadays,
various human resource information systems based on
cloud environment mainly focus on the development of
decision support function and the research on how to
use existing human resource data to further optimize the
matching relationship between internal employees and
post requirements. Such a data-driven approach can not
only solve the practical problems in business operation,
but also provide scientific decision support for optimized
human resource allocation [5—7].

In general, cloud-based staff assignment will be set up
during the business process establishment phase, where
it gives better control over the resources required to
perform an activity [8]. In the execution phase, busi-
ness process management can automatically integrate
resources into the corresponding work and redistribute
them to the corresponding execution roles [9]. We can
also use simple mechanisms such as sequence length or
round-robin for resource allocation. However, in many
real-world applications, such simple execution-phase allo-
cation mechanisms do not work well when allocating staff
and resources. For example, in order to ensure product
quality [10], a study of an engineering design process in
a manufacturing enterprise reveals that a typical compo-
nent design is typically assigned manually by the business
process management initiator [11]. According to the cur-
rent research status, these manual personnel assignment
jobs often occur in manufacturing enterprises, especially
in some important business processing tasks.

Actually, human resource allocation involves two
aspects: personnel and positions. for the essence that it
matches the human resources with positions. For decades,
enterprises and academia have realized the importance
of rational human resource allocation for an organization
and have been committed to studying these related fields
[12]. And the development of cloud computing technol-
ogy brings opportunities for human resource scheduling.
Therefore, the goal of all human resource development
theories is to select the right person for the right place
by cloud resources. The rational allocation of human
resources is influenced by many factors such as scale, eco-
nomic strength, culture, and the external environment of
the enterprise. At the same time, most of these factors
are nonlinear [13-15]. However, some traditional analy-
sis methods such as multiple linear regression (LR) and
analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are linear analysis [16].
However, human resource allocation data are compli-
cated, and the obvious disadvantages of these traditional
methods are strong subjectivity, low accuracy, and weak
capability to reflect the actual situation. In contrast to
the traditional linear methods, artificial neural networks
(ANNs) have unique advantages in dealing with nonlinear
problems based on cloud environment. ANNs have strong
self-learning ability, self-organizing characteristics, exten-
sive adaptability, fault tolerance, and predictability, which
help to deal various complex issues in human resource
allocation. In this paper, we adopt stack auto-encoder neu-
ral network to predict the required human resource and
fully consider the characteristics of similarity between dif-
ferent staff, which combines the prior information of posi-
tion fitness constraint to effectively realize the reasonable
allocation of semi-supervised human resources.

The major contributions of this paper are listed as fol-
lows:

e We propose a new method of human resource
scheduling method with sparse constraint, which can
efficiently represent the characteristics of human
resource in the cloud environment.

e We propose a new deep neuro-network structure
with four auto-encoder layers to get the human
resource feature, which can construct a relationship
between features and promote the prediction of
scheduling.

e We propose a novel method to calculate the post
fitness constraint. Assuming that both person i and
person j are suitable for the same post, so there must
be some similar attributes between person i and j.
Our new post fitness constraint can achieve good
classification result.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces the related work. In Section 3, we
propose a novel human resource scheduling strategy in
the cloud. In Section 4, we conduct extensive experiments
to compare our algorithm with the other two state-of-the-
art prediction methods. We make a conclusion and point
out our future work in Section 5.

2 Related work

For human resource allocation, one of the core business
processes is to identify and recruit people with corre-
sponding skills, abilities, knowledge, and experience to fill
the posts in enterprise organization [17-19]. Although
there are many human resource scheduling strategies and
mechanisms in the field of human resource scheduling,
there are still some drawbacks in the existing research
work. Liu et al. [20] introduced BP neural network to
conduct some comprehensive evaluation and analysis on
performance evaluation of enterprise human resource
management; this method provides a scientific and effec-
tive human resource evaluation system for enterprises.
Feng et al. [21] built an effective human resource allo-
cation model by summarizing the modularity, timeliness,
and reciprocity of human resource allocation, which uti-
lizes customer value and human resource core compe-
tence and takes trust mechanism as the links. Sliva et al.
[22] proposed a knowledge-based method to match the
job seekers. This method collected the data from appli-
cants through web interface and matched suitable jobs
through a web-based human resource management sys-
tem model by the network information server. However,
they have not considered the sparse constraint in their
scheduling strategies.

Li et al. [23] analyzed the matching relationship between
human resource management practice and organizational
situation based on BP neural network model, which estab-
lished a prediction model and received a good predic-
tion effect. Wang et al. [15] studied a large number of
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

influencing factors related to human resources, which
proved the effect of flexible degree of personnel resources
on the scheduling result. Zhang et al. [24] described
human resources by attributes such as skills, salary, and
degree of dedication to projects, so as to establish schedul-
ing constraints and realize human resource scheduling
by genetic algorithm. Liu et al. [25] provided an up-to-
date overview on four deep learning architectures, which
highlights the applications of deep learning techniques
on some selected areas. Similarly, the authors in [23]
constructed a deep BP neural network in conjunction
with specific old-age care scenarios, which was trained
as a whole structure by using instance monitoring data.
They all represent the characteristics of human resource.
However, they have not fully constructed the real rela-
tionship between input features and promoted scheduling
methods.

Although there are already many personnel allocation
strategies and mechanisms in the field of business process
management research, these research efforts are less likely
to be carried out at execution time to flexibly recommend
resources based on collaborative behavior relationships
[26, 27]. In work [28-31], researchers found that business
process management history information could be used to
improve the efficiency of cloud resource allocation during
business process management execution. Russell et al. [32,
33] introduced a new pattern that integrated work items
and scheduling resources based on the previous execution
history of cloud resources. Xu et al. and Priya et al. [34,
35] put forward the event of logging method to study the

(2020) 2020:73 Page 3 of 9

allocation law, which made the resource allocation work
in the execution phase more effective.

The abovementioned methods have made great achieve-
ments in human resource scheduling by cloud environ-
ment. However, most of them do not take into account
the nonlinear influencing factors in the human resource
allocation process as well as the specific relationship
between personnel that results static distribution of cloud
resources. Moreover, they do not provide enough descrip-
tions of human resource characteristics in the post allo-
cation process. In what follows, we will propose a new
deep nonlinear reconstruction model of human resources
to solve the deficiencies in the traditional human resource
allocation process based on cloud environment, which can
construct the relationship between features and predic-
tion results.

3 Human resource scheduling based on deep
representation in cloud environment

The allocation of enterprise human resources in cloud
environment should meet the reasonable matching of per-
sonnel and specific positions as shown in Fig. 1. In the
distribution process, the people who are suitable for the
same post often have certain similarities. In order to
better predict unallocated employees for the most suit-
able job, we will use different attributes to construct the
human resource network based on personnel relation-
ship module and put forward a novel nonlinear recon-
struction model about human resource scheduling in the
cloud.

The depth of human resource allocation will make the
matching process more reasonable so that all the tasks can
be completed in time.

3.1 Construction of human resource network

In the process of human cloud resource allocation, each
person has its specific attributes and outstanding mer-
its according to the working characteristics of different
human resources. For example, the attributes of a per-
son are X = “proficient in Java,’ “strong logical thinking;...,
“team work.’ These attributes show that the person is well
versed in Java programming and has good experience in
teamwork process. This indicates that the employee is
very suitable for the above work. Then this employee will
be more reliable for the post of Java development. The
attributes that the persons require for the same position
should be similar. Therefore, a specific human resource
network can be constructed based on the attributes of
each person.

If N job seekers are given and M attributes are set, a
human resource network G = (V,E,L) can be formed.
V = {vj1,vV2,....VN} is the vertex set, which represents N
job seekers. E = {ej} is the set of edges connecting two
vertices in V. Y = {Yz,, Yur} is the class standard of per-
sonnel, which is the matched post. The labels of staffs
assigned to a post are Yr4 = {Yj,..., Yz}, then the per-
sonnel category of unassigned posts Yyz = {Y¥(z+1), Yn}
can be obtained. The adjacency matrix of human resource
network G can be constructed from human resource rela-
tionship, which is a non-negative symmetric matrix A =
[aij] € RY xN' If there are edges between vertices i and j,
then aj = 1, else aj = 0. For all 1 < i < N, we have
aii = 0. Now we can introduce a symmetric matrix W =
[wij] € RY XN to depict the similarity of human resource in
the personnel network when a € RY.

3.2 Deep nonlinear distribution distance reconstruction
model for human resource allocation

Based on the nonlinear characteristics of human resource
relation network in cloud environment, a novel model is
adopted to deal with the problem of human resource allo-
cation. An important component module that is named
auto-encoder is introduced in this model. Auto-encoder is
a special neural network used to learn a new representa-
tion of the original data. The composition of auto-encoder
is shown in Fig. 2.

The data of x are input into the auto-encoder struc-
ture. They will be encoded by the encoder module and be
decoded by the decoder module. Then the decoded data
will be compared with the input data through the recon-
struction process. Based on the auto-encoder structure,
we can intend to minimize the error between input and
output data.

As the input of auto-encoder by the personnel relation-
ship matrix M, the encoded personnel relationship matrix
M will be mapped into a low dimensional embedding H =
[hij] € R4*N,, where d < N. So we can get the following
formula,

h; = f (mj) = s(;Wym; + dy) (3)

where Wy € R?*“ dy © R?*! is the weight of coding
layer and bias vector and s(.) is a nonlinear mapping func-
tion, that is the Softmax function Ssoftmax(*) = a This
function takes the vector as input and normalizes it into a
probability distribution consisting of input vector’s prob-
abilities proportional to the exponentials. After decoding,

the hidden layer representation H is reflected to the orig-
inal data space to yield a reconstruction of the original
data.

0; = g(hi) = s(Woh; + do) (4)

where Wo € RN*4, do © RN*! is the weight of decod-
ing layer and bias vector. Auto-encoder is mainly to study
in the condition of a parameter 90 = {Wy,dy,Wo,do},
which will reconstruct the original data to minimize the
raw data M and the reconstruct the deviation between
data O. So that a low dimensional nonlinear representa-
tion of H can be obtained.

To better achieve human resource scheduling in the
cloud, a novel deep structure is presented that can
improve the match between personnel and posts. As
shown in Fig. 3, this structure is a layer by layer training
network which applies four auto-encoder stacks to form a
stack auto-encoder.

For a deep auto-encoder network, we train the first
auto-encoder by reconstructing raw data in human rela-
tion matrix B and get a hidden layer representation H! €
R‘N x t;). Then H! can be served as the input of the next
auto-encoder. And the rest layers can be done in the same
manner. So the fourth auto-encoder will get a new repre-
sentation H* ¢ R\** by reconstructing the output of the
third auto-encoder.

Assuming that both person i and person j are suitable
for the same post, there must be some similar attributes
between persons i and j, which can be regarded as a pri-
ori information for human resource scheduling. Then a
post fitness matrix S$ =[sj] € RN can be defined to
represent the adaptability of person i and person j for a
certain post, the threshold range is from 0.1 to 1. Mean-
while, Euclidean distance is used to measure the similarity
D(h;, hj) of the hidden layer after training. Therefore, the
post fitness constraint can be written as the following
formula.

where A is the parameter between the regulatory recon-

Our proposed method uses the back propagation algo-
rithm of stochastic gradient descent to optimize the auto-
encoder. The parameter 0 = {Wy,dy, Wo, do} is updated
during each iteration and the network will be trained
continuously to effectively realize the personnel position
matching process.

4 Experiment results and analysis

The dataset of a given automobile manufacturing enter-
prise is used to test the performance of the human
resource scheduling method proposed by this paper in the
cloud environment this paper. This dataset is divided into
10 subsets with the same size and no mutual inclusion.
Then deep nonlinear reconstruction model for human
resource is applied to train the first 9 subsets and the other
subset is used as test data. The average value of 10 results
is used as the accuracy to estimate the precision of our
algorithm. According to the similarity between personnel
in training dataset, cross-validation is used to evaluate the
accuracy of matching between personnel and positions in
this model.

4.1 Experiment dataset
The dataset applied in this paper is the relevant data
of an automobile manufacturing enterprise, from which
2000 people are randomly selected as the experimental
data. As the deep nonlinear reconstruction model for
human resource allocation, the stacked auto-encoder net-
work consists of four auto-encoders. The layer allocation
of experimental data is set as [2000-512-256-128-64].
That is the first auto-encoder is 2000-512-2000 and
the second one is 512-256-512. The third auto-encoder
is 256-128-256 and the fourth one is 128-64-128. All the
auto-encoders are individually trained. Then the trained
hidden layer representation is selected from the four auto-
encoders for clustering. Here, k-means is adopted as the
clustering method to obtain the class standard informa-
tion of personnel.

4.3 Experiment results and discussion

We randomly select different numbers of personnel data
in the dataset. Table 1 shows the experiment results under
different numbers of selected personnel. For compari-
son purposes, two conventional methods are chosen as
the baseline. One is the DNR z2 [36] algorithm, which
applies L2 normal form to error loss function; the other
is the DNRcg [37] algorithm, which applies sigmoid-cross
entropy to error function. As shown in Tables 1 and 2,
the proposed method in this paper is superior to the
DNR (DNRz2) algorithm and the DNR (DNRcg) algo-
rithm under the condition of different numbers of person-
nel. Because our proposed algorithm fully considers the
related attributes between personnel and adopts the posi-
tion fitness constraint prior information after personnel
similarity processing, it not only improves the efficiency

but also avoids the complexity of manually matching per-
sonnel positions. Therefore, the allocation efficiency of
human resource department has been greatly improved in
the practical application.

In order to evaluate the impact of post fitness con-
straints on our algorithm, 2000 experimental data are
stacked and trained from four hidden layers in the auto-
encoder. As shown in Fig. 4, it can be seen that the four
hidden layers trained by the stacked auto-encoder can
better reflect the significant characteristics of personnel
compared with the evaluation of the other three different
hidden layers so as to achieve a higher prediction ability of

human resource allocation. Therefore, the deep nonlinear
reconstruction model of human resource allocation based
on the deep neural network proposed by this paper can
achieve better degrees of job matching in cloud environ-
ment, which effectively and reasonably allocates human
resources in automobile manufacturing enterprises and
achieves the optimization of human resource allocation.
As shown in Eq. (9) of Section 3, A is served as the control-
ling parameter between reconstruction error and different
values of constraint A can be obtained under different
value of cost function. Figure 5 shows the change in sen-
sitivity of the cost function as the value of A increases. It

proves that the cost function of our novel method can get
stable and low values by using four hidden layers, which
shows the best effect in this work.

5 Conclusion and future work

To effectively assist enterprises to achieve the opti-
mized allocation of human resources, this paper pro-
poses a deep nonlinear reconstruction model for human
resource allocation in cloud environment. Our model
can achieve semi-supervised post-personnel matching in
human resource management. The proposed method fully
considers the characteristics of personnel and explores
the similarity among personnel with other effective fac-
tors by cloud resources. Combining with the prior infor-
mation of personnel position fitness constraints, the
semi-supervised learning of personnel position match-
ing process greatly improves the overall prediction ability
based on the relationship module between personnel.
The proposed algorithm is tested on a dataset of auto-
mobile manufacturing enterprise. Experimental results
show that the model proposed in this paper can achieve
remarkable results in personnel position matching, which
effectively improves the efficiency of human resource
allocation.

Our future work will try to apply the method proposed
in this paper to the study of personnel arrangement pro-
cess in projects for cloud resource allocation, considering
that the working ability of personnel will directly affect the
efficiency of project completion.
