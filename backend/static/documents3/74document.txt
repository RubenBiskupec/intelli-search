Introduction

Slope stability assessment is regularly carried out by engineers to analyse the stability of
natural or man-made slopes and understand their failure mechanisms. In slope stability
assessment, it is essential to determine the critical slip surface, i.e. the one characterised
by the lowest safety factor, and, in professional practice, the analysis is routinely carried
out using Limit Equilibrium Methods (LEM). Unstable conditions can be induced by
several causes such as excessive surcharge load, earthquakes, heavy rainfall and dynamic
loads. They can lead to slope failures causing considerable damage to structures and
infrastructure facilities arising on them. The task is to find the minimum factor of safety
against all these destabilising factors.

The most widely used methods in slope stability assessment are the traditional limit
equilibrium methods [1-4]. In addition, finite difference technique [5, 6], distinct ele-
ment codes [7] and finite element strength reduction technique (FEM) [8-13] are
also used extensively. Use of optimisation methods such as dynamic programming
[14], downhill simplex algorithm [15] and Monte-Carlo (MC) technique [16] are also
reported. Recently, other optimisation techniques inspired by nature like ant colony
optimisation (ACO) [17-19], particle swarm optimisation (PSO) [20, 21], harmony

search (HS) [22], artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) [23], gravitational search algo-
rithm (GSA) [24], neural networks (NN) [25, 26] and genetic algorithms (GA) [27-29]
have received considerable attention and are gaining popularity in the geotechnical engi-
neering community in the last 10-15 years.

Cheng et al. [30] compared six metaheuristic optimisation methods and reported that
no single method can outperform other methods in all aspects, each one having its own
merits and limitations. In all these methods, it is paramount first to identify the critical
slip surface. This critical slip surface is found by comparing the factors of safety obtained
from several feasible trial surfaces and choosing the one with the minimum value. This
may sometimes be erroneous due to the presence of local minima points. Many existing
methods fail to identify the global minimum and may converge at a local minima even
for simple homogenous slopes [31]. Neural networks on the other hand are site specific,
require reliable training data and apply for particular cases only [25, 32, 33]. Discrete
ACO used previously for FS calculation takes too many fitness function evaluations
to compute optimum FS and has more uncertainty in FS estimation. Therefore several
global optimisation algorithms are available to locate critical slip surfaces but are either
too complex to implement for practitioners based on an excessive number of fitness
function evaluations. The use of finite element techniques bypasses the need to assume
the shape and location of the trial slip surfaces, but also introduces other complexities
including defining appropriate soil constitutive models.

Most of the existing software packages available for slope stability calculations [34-36]
implement a method of slip surface search called point grid approach. The location of
the centre point of the slip surface, that in this case is assumed as circular, is shifted dur-
ing the search until it corresponds to the lowest factor of safety. However, this method
does not assure that the slip surface retrieved corresponds the global minimum. Some
programs [37] implements cuckoo search [38] and simulated annealing [39] for non-
circular failure surfaces. Monte-Carlo search techniques are also implemented in limit
equilibrium slope stability programs (SAS-MCT 4.0) [40]. For evolutionary computa-
tion, codes such as Slope SGA [29, 41] incorporate a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for both
circular and non-circular slip surfaces. The commercially available software Geostudio
[35] uses an optimising function which is based on search techniques used by Greco [16]
and Malkawi et al. [40] to search for critical slip surface. Apart from that, to the authors’
knowledge, there is no other commercial program using intelligent algorithms optimisa-
tion techniques for slope stability analysis. Published research [17, 18, 30] demonstrates
that there is a growing interest in ant-based algorithm metaheuristic for slope stability
assessment.

Most of the intelligent algorithms for slope stability calculations are relatively new,
difficult to implement and not familiar to geotechnical engineers. Sengupta et al. [27]
used a circular surface with the genetic algorithm to find the location of the criti-
cal slip surface and the corresponding factor of safety using Bishop’s method of slices
[1]. The factor of safety was defined as a fitness function expressed in terms of coor-
dinates of the centre of the slip surface and its radius (three control variables). For
a non-circular slip surface, the control variables will be more than three. Kahatad-
eniya et al. [17] used discrete ant colony optimisation and Kashani et al. used [42]
Imperialistic Competitive Algorithm (ICA) to determine the optimal curve yielding
Mishra et al. Geo-Engineering (2020) 11:3 Page 3 of 16

minimum factor of safety using Morgenstern-Price method [3]. The ant colony opti-
misation technique used by Kahatadeniya et al. [17] was in discrete search space and
required careful calibration of parameters to arrive to correct results. Furthermore by
using discrete ACO the uncertainty in the estimation of FS was large and many fitness
function evaluations were needed to arrive to an optimum value. In ACO, the number
of fitness evaluations equals to product of population size with the total number of
iterations as in each iteration the fitness function is evaluated only once. As different
algorithms use different amounts of consumption of fitness function evaluations per
iteration so a comparison made only on maximum number of iterations as a stop con-
dition is not justified [43, 44].

In this study, an extended form of ACO, known as continuous ant colony optimisation
(ACOp), capable to solve problems in the continuous domain, is used for computing the
factor of safety for slope stability calculations. The minimum factor of safety is identi-
fied using ACO with control parameters varying continuously, differently than previ-
ously used approaches of ACO working with discrete intervals. Furthermore, the ACOr
is validated against theoretical benchmark example. Additionally, an actual field failure is
back-analysed using this technique. We will show that results obtained by the proposed
technique are in agreement with those of other researches and with those obtained by
standard software.

Apart from being applied in slope stability, ACO and its variants have been used in
other civil engineering optimisation problems, e.g. identifying structural damages from
changes in natural frequencies [45-47], allocation of railway platforms [48], design of
concrete retaining walls [49], damage detection in structures [50], guiding vehicles to
less congested paths [51, 52], forecasting river flow [53] to mention a few of them. These
works demonstrate the potential of ACO techniques in solving civil engineering optimi-
sation problems.

Setting of slope stability analysis

For setting up a slope stability analysis, the first step is to generate a kinematically fea-
sible slip surface for the slope and calculate the factor of safety associated with it. The
study considered a non-circular slip surface by linking straight lines using a method pro-
posed by Cheng [54]. To start the generation of a slip surface, the failure mass is divided
into N slices of equal width as shown in Fig. 1. The limits of variable x; and xy +1 are the
entry (x;, x,) and exit points range (xz, xz) (Fig. 1) which depend on the experience of
the practitioner while all other control variables (01 ,..., oy—1) vary between 0 and 1. The

slip surface can hence be described as follows:

V =[Vi, V2,..., Vn, Vn] (1)
In terms of coordinates it can be written as:

V = [(41, 91), (2,92) +--+ (4ND IN) N41, N41) ] (2)

The x co-ordinates of points lying between entry and exit (%9,...,.*)7) are equally spaced
as follows:

For determining the y-coordinates of each vertex (V3,...,Vy) the upper and lower bounds
(VYimax and Yimin) are considered, where i denotes the index of vertices. The process
of determination of upper and lower bounds of y; is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen
y-coordinates of each vertex are different with each slip trial surface, so control variable
o is used which always varies between 0 to 1 irrespective of the considered slip surface.
Hence, y; can be determined dynamically between the maximum and minimum values

for y; by the following equation:
Vi = Yimin + Yimax — Yimin) X Oi-1;. 1 = 2,...,N (4)
The optimisation problem for searching a critical slip surface can be summarised as:

min f(x <—V) s.t x1 <%1 <%y3 XL < xN41 < HU; O< oj, <1i=1,...,N—-1
(5)
where V can be obtained by the procedure explained above.

A generalised slip surface is thus defined by a set of N + 1 decision variables to
optimise; x1, 01 ,....0N—1, *N+1. Each set of combinations of decision variables repre-
sents one trial slip surface.

After the generation of a trial slip surface, the second step is to determine the factor
of safety (fitness function) associated with each slip surface. The original formulation
of Morgenstern-Price method for calculating FS of a slope involves nonlinear equa-
tions which have to be solved numerically. The algorithm developed by Zhu et al. [55]
based on the Morgenstern-Price method is used here to calculate the factor of safety.

Finally, all the control variables [x1, 01,....0N—1, xn+1] are optimised iteratively until
Mishra et al. Geo-Engineering (2020) 11:3 Page 5 of 16

the termination criteria is met using the ACOg algorithm to find the right combina-
tion leading to the minimum safety factor.

Theoretical background of ant colony optimisation (ACO)

Ant colony optimisation (ACO)

Ant colony optimisation proposed by Dorigo and Stutzle [56] is a biologically inspired
swarm optimisation method mimicking the foraging behaviour of ant colonies. They
find the shortest possible path from their origin point (start) to the food source (finish)
by releasing a chemical known as pheromone. When a lone ant randomly tries to find
the food source, it can sense the pheromone trail left by other ants that have previously
followed the same path. The pheromone trail stores local information of the path and is
reinforced as each successive ant passes. It is a population based search technique for
optimisation of problems having many inputs based on trail-laying and trail-following
of its members to find the optimum solution. This foraging behaviour can be artificially
simulated and can be used to solve engineering problems.

The research presented here explores the ACO optimisation algorithm in calculating
the minimum factor of safety of the slope. In fact, the problem of finding the critical fail-
ure surface is very much similar to problems leading to a shortest optimised path. Fig-
ure 2 shows the permitted paths for a number of variables with their limits. The objective
is to find the path which leads to a minimum factor of safety. The weighted connected
graph shows the set of nodes and connections between them. In each case, a node rep-
resents the value of the variable to be chosen. The ants move from node to node to the
right recording each node visited so as to update the pheromone trail. The lines between
the nodes indicate the flow of ant path from one node to the next, chosen probabilisti-
cally as explained in the following point 1 on probabilistic transition and depending on
the intensity of pheromone on that node. When ACO framework is implemented as an
algorithm for solving either discrete or continuous optimisation problem, the following

rules have to be followed by ants:

Tj, is the amount of pheromone on trail associated with node (i, /), NK is the possible

ing the degree of importance of the pheromones. @ is generally chosen as 1 [56] to
allow diversification in solutions otherwise a higher value of a will influence ACO
to intensify amount of pheromone to previously visited nodes leading to premature

convergence.

The rule as shown in Fig. 3 explains how the ant will select the path with a higher
level of pheromone concentration. The ant path is characterised by vector
x1,2 > 013 > 021 > O14 > *nN+4155 as this path has maximum pheromone con-
centration at these nodes (marked by solid circles). In essence, calculation in this
case is carried out starting from the first control variable (% ) and exhaustively iden-
tifying all possible paths until reaching the finish variable (xy+1). The movement to
successor node is determined by the stochastic decision rule given in Eq. 6 which is
function of its local pheromone level and relative importance of pheromone.

deposited by Ath ant at node (i, /). Tj. and t;, denotes the updated and previous
cant iterations, this decreasing the diversification of solutions leading to premature
convergence.
For discrete ant colony optimisation algorithm, a number of artificial ants are consid-
ered (m). Each ant builds a solution by visiting node to node on the graph (Fig. 3) in
forward direction where each node has transition probability attached to it. An ant visits
nodes representing variables of the optimisation problem (1 to N + 1). The initial inten-
sity of pheromone on each node can be initialised to 1, so that all the paths have an equal
probability of being chosen and no path is being left out. Hence, at first iteration, all the
nodes have the same pheromone concentration that is tj = tT) = 1 (i= 1, 2,.., N+ 1 j
= 1, 2,...,m). The pheromone concentration at each node is globally updated dynami-
cally in each iteration after all ants have successfully deposited the pheromone on their
trail path. The pheromone updating aims to boost the pheromone trails in promising
regions. The shorter path will have a higher quantity of pheromone level than the longer
path owing to its lower evaporation. The iterations are carried out for a number of cycles
to produce the optimum solution. At the end of iteration cycle, based on the quality of
solution constructed by ants, more pheromone will be concentrated on nodes that con-
struct the best solution.

ACO for continuous optimisation—ACOg

An extension of the original ACO algorithm developed for discrete domains is continu-
ous ant colony optimisation (ACO) which works for decision variables in continuous
domains. The ACOr has been more practical to use as in practical applications deci-
sion variables lay in continuous domains. The continuous ACO algorithm was proposed
by Socha et al. [57] inspired from discrete ACO and works without making any major
changes in the original ACO framework. The fundamental idea of ACOk is to consider
continuous probability density function (PDF) P(x) instead of discrete PDF according to
Eq. 6 to construct solutions. As the domain of each variable in ACOg is continuous, an
ant sampling is based on a continuous probability-density function P(x). The procedure
of using ACOr meta-heuristics is outlined below.

In this study, slip surface is represented by a set of N + 1 decision variables; x1, 01
yee) ON—1, XN+1. For a N + 1 dimensional continuous problem, an archive of k solutions
denoted by S (Eq. 8) is constructed. Each solution in the archive contains the value of
N + 1 variables used to construct a generic trial slip surface and the factor of safety asso-
ciated with it. This solution archive is equivalent to pheromone model used by discrete
ACO to keep a memory of the search history. As pheromone cannot be updated directly,
the equivalent step is updating the solution archive. The size of the archive k, which is
also a controlling parameter of the algorithm, must be greater than the dimensions of
variables being solved. For example, in our case we are using 30 slices (N) for slip sur-
face discretisation having 31 (N + 1) control variables, so a minimum archive size of 31
must be taken. The structure of solution archive in ACOg comprises of three matrices as
follows.

The position of control variables defining slip surface outlined in "Setting of slope sta-

bility analysis" section are stored in the following matrix S of sizek x N +1:

Wk k

To initialise the algorithm, random sets of all k solutions having N + 1 control variables
are chosen within the specified parameter range to construct all the rows of the archive
matrix S, which is equivalent to pheromone initialisation in discrete ACO algorithm.
The solutions in the archive are always sorted according to fitness function (fi < fo<...<
J) values. In the following examples, the safety factor associated with each slip surface
is computed by Spencer’s method, i.e. Morgernester-Price method with interslice func-
tion f(x) = 1.

As the iteration proceeds, better sets of solutions are appended to the population
and solutions with lower fitness values are removed from it. At each iteration, m new
solutions are produced and among them the best k solutions are retained. The step
is basically biased towards selecting best solutions and is equivalent to pheromone
updating in discrete ACO. Mathematically for construction a solution as shown in
matrix S, an ant has to choose the decision variable si for every unknown variable i =
1, 2,..., N +1. The row j of matrix S is chosen probabilistically for all N + 1 construc-

tion steps to generate new solutions for the archive as follows:
Oj

P= a
eI w]

where w is defined as matrix of associated weights of each solution whose elements are
computed by employing a gaussian function [57]. For the jth row of the archive associ-
ated weight «,; is defined as follows:

(=?

oj = ——e 20h” (13)

qk/ 21

 

where q is the selection pressure varying between 0 to 1 of the algorithm which controls
the exploration and exploitation rate in ACOr. If q is small, the best-ranked solutions
are preferred, while for larger values of q, the probability of choosing control variables
becomes more uniform.

The ant subsequently chooses the value si and samples its neighbourhood for a new
value for variable i = 1, 2,..., N, N + 1 and reiterates this operation for all control vari-
ables using the same jth solution using a probability density function (PDF). Although

different choices are possible, in this work a Gaussian function is again chosen [6]:

where for the mean Ii, the values of the ith variable for all the solutions deposited the

archive S become the elements of the vector pei:
Hj = {ys Mas gh = {8} 899-0 Sih (15)

Furthermore, the values of standard deviation o} can be calculated dynamically as the
average distance from the chosen solution si to other solutions and then multiplying
with the parameter € > 0 which determines the convergence speed of the algorithm as

follows:

 

 

j=8 Dd) — U6)

After each iteration, the set of newly generated solutions will be refreshed in the archive,
and then the archive for keeping the best k solutions probabilistically. The candidate
solutions stored in archive are used to modify the probability distribution such that it is
biased towards sampling high quality solutions. This process is repeated until the maxi-

mum number of iterations are reached.

Application of the proposed technique

For the purpose of demonstrating the efficacy of the ACO algorithm to locate the criti-
cal slip surface and the associated minimum safety factor, two case studies are analysed.
One case study is from published literature and the second one is from a failed road
embankment located in eastern India. Since ACO is a non-deterministic method i.e.
giving different solution for each computation, the FS values and standard deviation
reported are based on a number of simulations equal to 10 to capture the uniformity in
the solutions.

As described in "Theoretical background of ant colony optimisation (ACO)" section, in
the ACOk introduction, the size of the archive (k), the number of ants (m), the selection
pressure (gq) and pheromone evaporation rate (€) play important role in convergence
speed of the algorithm. To strike a balance between diversification and convergence of
the search process, proper selection of these parameters is important. After carrying out
parametric analysis and following the suggestions by Socha and Dorigo [57] and Majum-
dar et al. [58], the constant parameters of the proposed algorithm have been set up as

follows: m = 50, q = 0.5, = 1, k = 40 and maximum iterations = 200.

Literature example

The literature example with four soil layers has been taken from Zolfaghari et al. [29].
Geometry of the soil slope and soil properties are shown in Fig. 4. The soil layers are
horizontal except for the first and second ones which are slightly inclined. The example
is analysed using ACOk in dry conditions for two cases: (1) No earthquake loading (case

1), (2) Earthquake loading (pseudo-static horizontal coefficient of 0.1) (case 2).

Table 1 summarises the results of both loading cases and compares them with those
of optimisation techniques used by other researchers. Figure 4 reports the critical slip
surface obtained and the one determined by the commercial software Geoslope [35].
The minimum FS obtained for case 1 i.e without earthquake loading is 1.293 with stand-
ard deviation of 0.008 and 1.010 in the presence of earthquake loading, with a standard
deviation of 0.025. The proposed algorithm gives lower factors of safety than the GA,

PSO and ABC for the two cases considered. Comparative assessment shows that the FS
computed by MPSO, ACO and Geoslope analysis tend to be similar to that computed by
the proposed approach, showing the efficacy of this latter. The lower FS represents the
capture of global minimum.

However, computational experiments indicate that, for practical purposes, the desired
accuracy can be achieved after 200 iterations (i-e., after a number of 10,000 fitness func-
tion evaluations), and thus, it is computationally similar to ABC. The fitness function
evaluations when compared to discrete ACO (150,000) [17] are significantly reduced,
thereby leading to reduction in computation time. Furthermore, the computational time,
determined by calculating the average time for 10 computations, was assessed on the
basis of an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU 3.40 GHz processor with 4.00 GB RAM. For

one simulation, average computing time is approximately 40 s for the ACO algorithm.

Engineering application

The proposed methodology is also applied to a case study of an embankment failure,
located in eastern India. The National Highway no. 316 is a very important highway in
eastern India and a part of it connects the cities of Bhubaneswar and Puri (Fig. 5a) is
constructed over soft clay deposits. The existing two lane national highway is being aug-
mented in capacity by increasing the number of lanes. Furthermore, a rail over bridge
was proposed in the place of barrier crossing. To take the road to the elevation of the
rail over bridge, an approach embankment was proposed with a maximum height of
11 m. The embankment is 27 m wide at the top and 35 m at the bottom with a side
slope of 70°. During construction, signs of distress were observed on the left hand side

of the embankment, when the embankment height reached its maximum value. After

2 months, the approach embankment failed (Fig. 5c, d) at Samajajpur at about 12.8 km
from the city of Puri.

Geotechnical investigations

Five boreholes concentrated primarily on the right hand side were drilled for the initial
investigations. After failure, 23 boreholes were drilled both on the left hand and right
hand side (Fig. 5a). The construction was stopped as heaving was seen at about 16 m
from the embankment (see Fig. 5b—d). The subsoil was throughly characterised for index
properties and undrained shear strength of the foundation soil. Figure 6 shows the varia-
tion of undrained shear strength as obtained from initial and post failure investigations,
as well as their respective average profiles. It can be observed that the left hand side soil
profile is weaker than the soil profile in right hand side. Average values of soil strength
parameters were used in the analysis for both the cases considered (first and second

investigation) obtaining the results reported in Fig. 7.

Analysis with ACOr

In this case, the algorithm was modified as the entry point xj is not variable and is taken
as the middle point of the road (x; = 0). Indeed, the pictures of the site after the failure
reveal that the entry of the failure surface was in the middle of the embankment. The
factor of safety was calculated using Slope/w [35], a Limit Equilibrium Method software
using Morgenstern Price method and a Finite Element Method using strength reduction

module in RS2 [37]. Table 2 compares the results from the analysis, and it can be seen

they closely match with each other. The ACO analysis provides a FS range whose lower
value is from 3 to 9% lower than the FS of the other analyses and whose upper value has
a difference of 6% at the most from the other analyses.

It can be concluded that FS is more than 1 if we consider the results of the initial inves-
tigation (as designers did) with LEM, FEM and ACO whereas FS < 1 if we consider the
results of the investigation which was carried out after the failure of the embankment.
Figure 7 reports the critical slip surface obtained by the calculation carried out using
ACOg, obtaining the safety factors reported in Table 2. The effect of geogrids and pore
water pressure was not considered in the analysis for simplification but could be incor-

porated with minor modification in the Matlab sub-routines.

Summary and conclusions

In this paper, we presented a technique for slope stability assessment using continu-
ous ant colony optimisation algorithm (ACOk). The algorithm is tested with literature
benchmark example and with data of landslide failure coming from slope failure at a
road embankment site. The parameters used in the ACO algorithm are calibrated to

avoid trapping into local minima leading to sub-optimal results. We also presented an

application of our technique applied to one heterogeneous slope having one weak soil
layer. The results of the proposed technique are compared with reported results of GA,
PSO, HS, ABC and discrete ACO for the chosen literature example. The performance
of ACOg was found to be better than that of the other approaches in terms of comput-
ing the minimum FS and determining the critical slip surface. Such characteristics make
the proposed algorithm suitable for practitioners to identify the critical non-circular slip
surface in real slope stability problems.
