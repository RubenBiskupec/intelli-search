Abstract

Web-based enterprises have increasingly begun to build their own virtual brand community on the Cloud. How to
encourage Web users to generate Web content in the Web community continuously and permanently has become
the focal point. However, few studies have explored that how to drive the motivation of user-generated content
(UGC) named self-enhancement (SE) internalized from the perspective of user's personal characteristics and then
enhance the intention of UGC. Even fewer studies have been devoted to drive the motivation of UGC from the
perspective of information technology. Based on self-construal (SC) theory, self-determination (SD) theory, and
current immersive applications of Edge computing, we proposed to a solution of user-generated content
motivation internalized in the virtual brand community implemented through the manipulation of the tradeoff of
inter-Edge and Cloud processing. Our survey shows that different types of self-construal (SC) users have different
levels of internal motivation for self-enhancement (SE) accomplished through the organization of user
characteristics. We build a detailed simulation of the change of time delay, availability, and cost of inter-Edge and
Cloud conversion to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed mechanism of UGC motivation internalized in the
virtual brand community in guiding enhancing the intention of UGC in the community in practice.

1 Introduction

With the rapid development of various network technol-
ogy especially Cloud computing [1, 2] and Edge comput-
ing [3, 4], traditional marketing methods are undergoing
great changes, and various forms of virtual brand com-
munities in social networks [5] take advantage of the
trend. Starbucks, Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, and other
enterprises have successively established their virtual
brand communities. The platform mechanism of two-
way interaction enables enterprises not only pays atten-
tion to their published content, but also more eager to
hear more users’ voices in the community [6, 7]. Mean-
while, the social function of the networked community
and even mobile network [8] also provides great con-
venience for the communication between users and nar-
rowing the psychological distance between them [9].
Therefore, compared with existing market-generated

content (MGC) in the networked community, more and
more users choose to trust user-generated content
(UGC) in the community [10-13]. Relative to the late
specializing in the professionally generated content
(PGC), although its content quality is more assured, be-
cause its cost is higher, UGC still has a certain advantage
with its cheap, wide, and fast update features, welcomed
by the enterprise. In a word, with the accumulated sup-
port of the virtual brand community accelerated through
Cloud and Edge applications, UGC has not only
emerged in large numbers, but also become an ex-
tremely valuable strategic marketing resource [18], take
Xiaomi community as an example. As of March 2019,
there were 37 million posts in the community, and the
huge amount of UGC has become an important source
of product innovation of Xiaomi. However, compared
with active users, there are still a considerable number
of lurking users in the community. Many virtual brand

communities are faced with problems such as low user
stickiness and insufficient generated content [15, 16].

As the release subject of UGC, it is easier to grasp the
changes in users’ psychology and motivation from the per-
spective of their own characteristics [17]. It is not hard to
find that, however, the existing studies mostly still stay at
the level of motivation itself, lacking discussion on the
fundamental factors affecting the internalization of motiv-
ation, especially the characteristics of community users.
Although to some extent it can explain how to promote
UGC intention, the problem is how to effectively promote
the internalization of motivations which affect the UGC
intention. This is because the internally motivated group
believes that activities are pleasant and satisfying and will
identify with the social rules and integrate them into itself,
so as to persist for a long time and produce positive be-
havioral results [18-20]. In fact, China has the traditional
culture of attaching importance to social relations. Simi-
larly, virtual brand communities connect consumers with
common brand preferences and needs. Community values
are also created based on establishing or maintaining good
relationships between users and brands and promoting
UGC [21]. Then, it is still a problem whether there is a
close relationship between the internal motivation of
UGC and the social and relatedness needs (RNs) gener-
ated by the users in the community. More importantly, as
the main body of the community, users define SC types
through how to deal with their relations with others and
then display corresponding needs, motivations, and behav-
ioral tendencies [22, 23]. Therefore, if we cannot deeply
understand the formation mechanism of the internaliza-
tion of UGC motivation from the perspective of users, it is
difficult for enterprises [24] to carry out socialized market-
ing according to different types of users. For this purpose,
this study introduces the theories of self-construal (SC)
and self-determination (SD) to explore the differences in
the needs of different types of SC users in the community
and the further impact on the motivation and intention of
UGC triggered by this.

Towards converting the lurking users to active UGC
contributors, many studies have focused on the impact
of external motivations represented by platform incen-
tive mechanism on UGC intention [15, 23]. Some
scholars start from internal motivation to explore how
to motivate users to generate more content. Research
conducted by Kamboj et al. shows that internal motiva-
tions, including entertainment and brand preference, can
significantly stimulate value-creating behaviors such as
UGC in the community [25]. Yang believes that with the
popularity of independent media, satisfaction and altru-
ism become important drivers for users to generate con-
tent [26]. Toubia and Stephen summarized two
motivations for users to initiate and forward UGC, in-
cluding intrinsic utility and image-related utility [27].

This paper is a further study of this part with a com-
bination of the implementation strategy of inter-Cloud
and Edge processing conversions which utilize the ad-
justment power of communication time delay [28], re-
source availability [29], and processing robustness [30]
under a value/cost-driven ambition [31, 32] through the
deployment of Edge [4] nodes.

Firstly, based on the empirical survey, through synthe-
sizing our collected data, we revealed the influence prin-
ciples of individual SC of users in the virtual brand
community on the internalization of UGC motivation,
providing certain guidance for brand managers to focus
on target groups, meet their psychological needs, and
enhance their intention of UGC.

We further explored the influence of personal traits on
UGC motivation internalization from the perspective of
community users. Through introducing the theory of
self-construal (SC) and self-determination (SD) theory,
we revealed the mechanism of the users’ characteristics.

Edge nodes can function to aid the network content
ageregation with faster speed, more ensured availability,
and robust scalability with much cheaper cost among
users inside a virtual community and among communi-
ties. Since less time delay means more opportunities of
participated discussions and deepened opinion exchange,
from the implementation perspective, we can add Edge
node to increase the local processing power inside com-
munities or switch inefficient Cloud-based processing to
efficient nearby Edge nodes to shorten the social dis-
tance for users including both independent self-
construal (IDP-SC) and interdependent self-construal
(ITD-SC). Similarly, relative advantages bundled with
introducing Edge nodes such as ensured resource avail-
ability and enhanced processing robustness can also be
employed to enable the conversion between independent
self-construal (IDP-SC) and_ interdependent  self-
construal (ITD-SC).

2 Empirical theories and models in social network
2.1 Self-construal theory and self-determination theory

The self-construal theory is widely used to explain how
individuals view, define, and explain their relationship
with others. Markus and Kitayama explicitly proposed
two concepts: ITD-SC and IDP-SC for the first time
[22]. ITD-SC values social relationships and tries to fit
in with the group. Their behavior is largely determined
by how they perceive the thoughts and feelings of those
around them. While the IDP-SC pays more attention to
maintaining its own autonomy and independence, it
does not exclude the establishment and maintenance of
harmonious social relations with others, especially when
it gains pleasure and benefits [33, 34]. The self-construal
theory has been applied in different areas. In the virtual
brand community, members with independent self-
Song et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

construal mainly behave themselves, but also interact
with others. Customers show both independence and
interdependence dimensions without contradiction. Both
types of SC have a certain degree of need for social rela-
tionships in the virtual brand community. We did the
following simplified formulation of ITD-SC and IDP-SC.

SC

:=(ITD-SC,IDP-SC)

::=(inside, outside)

IDP-SC

::=(autonomy, independence)

= (inside gefinedBy(self outside gefineaBy(self))

ITD-SC

= (inside gefinedBy(ITD-SC,IDP-SC)»
outside gefinedBy(ITD-SC,IDP-SC))

= (inside gefineaBy(ITD-SC)iNSide gefinedBy(IDP-SO)»

outsidegefinedBy(ITD-SC), OUtSIdegefinedBy(IDP-SC))

= (inside gefinedBy(ITD-SC)» OUtSIE gefinedBy(ITD-SC)s

= (inside gefinedBy(ITD-SC), OUtSIde gefinedBy(ITD-SC)s

InSide gefinedBy(self) OULSIAE gefineaBy(self))

:=(insidegefinedBy(ITD-SC), OUtSIdedefinedByTD-sc)» IDP-
SC)

From the above formalization based on the link be-
tween human inside and outside divisions, we demon-
strate the inclusion relationship between IDP-SC and
ITD-SC or the possibility of conversion from IDP-SC to
ITD-SC. Actually, every individual has two types of self
[35, 36] which are tied closely by the networking tech-
nology in the virtual brand community which in turn
can utilize the difference of the different types of users
in term of individuals’ cognition, motivation, and emo-
tion and then stimulate certain social behaviors [37-41].

According to the view of self-determination theory,
human beings are born with three basic psychological
needs, namely, relatedness needs, autonomy needs, and
competence needs [42]. Personal motivation is related to
these three internal psychological needs, which play an
important nutritional role in the internalization of self-
motivation [43]. This internalization process creates a
closer psychological attachment to the community and
motivates new users to help achieve the community’s
goals. Meeting basic psychological needs plays an im-
portant role in the promotion of the internalization of
individual motivation which in turn brings better enjoy-
ment and higher participation of individual, and pro-
motes individuals to stick to a certain activity for a long
time and produce more positive behavioral results [18-—
20]. Researches found that the satisfaction of users’ per-
ceived RNs can effectively promote the fit between users
and the brand community [46, 47]. Therefore, SD theory

(2020) 2020:14 Page 3 of 17

can be used to effectively influence [44, 45] the internal-
ization mechanism of UGC motivation in the virtual
brand community.

2.2 Empirical adaptation of self-construal

SC is a stable personality trait, but some scholars believe
that SC can be regarded as a state. That is, for the same
consumer, his/her SC may change to some extent in dif-
ferent situations and at different points in time. SC can
actively regulate the relationship between community
interaction and user participation. A person’s different
self-construal can activate multiple motivations for ac-
tual behavior. For example, in the virtual brand commu-
nity, if users pay more attention to the relationship
between themselves and others for interaction, more
UGC will be generated such as dissemination and com-
ment. When they see themselves as different from other
users, they will produce more unique content. Therefore,
we can change the interaction state and behavior mode
of users in the virtual brand community by certain
means (Fig. 1).

Empirically, we can change the SC state of consumers
through certain means and promote the users with inde-
pendent self-construal (IDP-SC users) to gradually trans-
form to ITD-SC by increasing their communication and
interaction with others. In other cases, we set the scene
so that he/she thinks he/she is different from others,
thus showing his/her independent side. One common
tactic is to give consumers a text containing many “I”
and ask them to circle all of them. In fact, in the process
of circling “I,” consumers will inadvertently call their
characteristics to mind, thus initiating IDP-SC. If, on the
other hand, ITD-SC is needed to be initiated, the con-
sumer can be presented with a similar text in which all
the “T’ is replaced by “we.” By controlling the number
and location of Edge nodes, the cost and time of user-
generated content can be changed, and the transform-
ation between IDP-SC and ITD-SC can be realized as
required.

3 Empirical survey design and data analysis

By testing the hypothesis, we demonstrate that different
types of SC users have different degrees of internal mo-
tivation to drive users to generate content in the virtual
community. Therefore, the feasibility of our proposed
mechanism of UGC motivation internalized in the vir-
tual brand community, and guiding the enhancement of
the intention of UGC was verified, as the basic of the
simulation.

3.1 Hypotheses for users

We have made the following grouped hypotheses for
performing the empirical survey in the context of a vir-
tual brand community.

1. The influence of user self-construal (SC) on RNs:
(a) H1: ITD-SC users can positively influence the
generation of RNs.
(b) H2: IDP-SC users can also positively influence
the generation of RNs.
2. The influence of user self-construal (SC) on self-
determination (SE) motivation:
(c) H3: IDP-SC users will positively influence the
generation of SE motivation.
(d) H4: ITD-SC users will also positively influence
the generation of SE motivation.
3. The influence of RNs on the self-determination (SE)
motivation:
(e) H5: RNs of users positively influence the SE
motivation.
4. The influence of RNs on the intention of UGC:
(f) H6: In the virtual brand community, RNs of
users positively influence UGC intention.
5. The influence of self-determination (SE) motivation
on UGC intention:
(g) H7: Users’ SE motivation positively influences
UGC intention.
(h) H8: RNs of users play an intermediary role
between ITD-SC and SE motivation.

 

(i) H9: RNs of users play an intermediary role
between IDP-SC and SE motivation.

(j) H10: The SE motivation of users plays an
intermediary role between the RNs and UGC
intention.

3.2 Index system design and questionnaire design

The hypothesis model of this paper is summarized ac-
cording to existing theories and previous empirical stud-
ies. The measurement indexes involved in the model are
all from the existing literature and modified according to
the characteristics of the virtual brand community. The
IDP-SC mainly includes four questions, the ITD-SC
mainly includes five questions, and the RN, UGC motiv-
ation, and UGC intention include four questions. These
issues are mainly used to collect the influencing factors
when converting between IDP-SC and ITD-SC to sup-
port our subsequent simulation (see Table 1 for the spe-
cific sources).

In addition to the test items for each variable, this
study also added demographic indicators such as basic
information, gender, age, education background, occupa-
tion, and monthly income of respondents who partici-
pated in the virtual brand community. This information
is primarily used to factor in the modification of param-
eter weights in our subsequent simulations. All variables
were measured using a 5-point Likert scale, and demo-
graphic indicators were designed as options.

3.3 Random sampling survey and data collection

Since the theoretical model to be tested is built in the
context of the virtual brand community, the research ob-
ject of this paper is all user groups in the virtual brand
community. With the development of network technol-
ogy, various forms of virtual brand communities have
rapidly grown, including the official BBS, official Weibo,
and fan communication groups, which also provide a
great convenience for the investigation of this research.

In the early stage, Singelis’ self-construal scale was
used for this experiment, with 1-12 items measuring
ITD-SC and 13-24 items measuring IDP-SC. We set up
a measurement experiment and divided the respondents
into 2 groups according to the SC type: IDP-SC and
ITD-SC.

The survey began on March 18, 2019, and ended on
April 10, 2019, lasting for 22 days and was conducted
simultaneously by online and offline questionnaires. A
total of 394 questionnaires were issued. Meanwhile, ac-
cording to the needs of the research purpose, this study
also conducted a strict condition screening of the re-
spondents and confirmed the experience of participating
in a virtual brand community before filling in the ques-
tionnaires. After obtaining the questionnaire, further in-
vestigation was conducted to eliminate invalid
questionnaires, including checking whether the filling
time is less than 1 min and whether the same scoring
options are selected for all questions. Finally, 352 valid
questionnaires were collected from 394 questionnaires
filled in, with a recovery rate of 89.3%.

3.4 Descriptive statistical analysis

Analyzing descriptive statistical results of user basic in-
formation in 352 valid questionnaires, most users have
been registered as members of the virtual brand

community for more than 6 months, and half of all users
in the community maintain a higher activity, logins more
than 4 times a week. It shows that the respondents have
a certain understanding of the virtual brand community
and rich participation experience, easy to collect good
data for use in our simulations.

A reasonable proportion of men and women partici-
pated in the questionnaire survey, 18 to 39 years old
young user group accounted for 95%, education back-
ground of bachelor degree or above accounted for
86.3%, 3000 yuan or above monthly income of users
accounted for 50.9%, and occupation covers students,
enterprise employees, self-employed, office personnel,
and other industries. This data is basically consistent
with the data of the 43rd “Statistical Report on the De-
velopment of China’s Internet” published by CNNIC in
2019; therefore, the random survey sample has certain
representativeness.

We use SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 24.0 for data testing and
hypothesis testing, respectively. First of all, the reliability
and validity test of the scale can be seen in Tables 2 and 3.
Table 2 shows that Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of all la-
tent variables reaches the minimum acceptable critical
value of 0.6 [9, 60] and the composite reliability values
were also above the threshold of 0.6 [60, 61]. It indicates
that the measurement of various latent variables is rela-
tively reliable. In terms of validity analysis, Table 2 shows
that the standardized factor loading of most indicators is
greater than 0.6, and the T value is much higher than
1.96, which is significant when p < 0.001. Although the
AVE values of latent variables ID and UM are slightly
lower than 0.5, their composite reliability is higher than
0.6, indicating that the convergent validity of all latent var-
iables is acceptable [9, 62, 63]. The results in Table 3 show
that the value of the correlation coefficient between every

AVE is also greater than the correlation coefficient be-

tent variable has a good discriminant validity [62].

As a systematic error, the common method deviation
will greatly affect the effectiveness of the research. First

coefficient between potential variables is 0.676, which is
also significantly less than the judgment standard of 0.9.
Therefore, by combining the results of the two tests, it
can be said that the common method of this study is not
seriously deviated.

The path of the research model was tested. AMOS 24.0
used the maximum likelihood estimation method to cal-
culate the fitting indexes and path coefficient estimates of
the model. The test results showed that all the fitting in-
dexes were within the acceptable range, and the research
model composed of latent variables had a good fitting de-
gree, including RMSEA = 0.063, RMR = 0.040, CFI =
0.921, GFI = 0.889, AGFI = 0.859, TLI = 0.908, IFI =
0.921, and y’/df = 2.410 (Table 4). Therefore, this research
model interprets the impact of self-construal on the in-
ternalization of UGC motivation. Figure 2 showed the
path analysis results in the model, which indicated that
the first seven major research hypotheses are supported.

In the final test of mediation, the test methods act as
intermediary role adopted by Baron and Kenny has a
series of problems [64]. In order to further understand
the intermediary role of RNs between SC of users and
SE motivation and the intermediary role of SE motiv-
ation between RNs and UGC intention, this study
adopted Bootstrap intermediary inspection method,
which is widely recommended and used [65], through
the PROCESS plug-in in SPSS 23.0 (Table 5).

First, when analyzing the mediating effect of the re-
latedness needs between interdependent self-construal
and_ self-enhancement motivation, the test results
showed that the confidence interval of Bootstrap test
under 95% confidence interval is 0.1918 and 0.3309,

respectively, which did not contain 0, 6 = 0.2563, indi-
cating that the mediating effect of relatedness needs is
significant. Secondly, when analyzing the mediating ef-
fect of relatedness needs between independent self-
construal and self-enhancement motivation, the test re-
sults showed that the confidence interval of Bootstrap
test under 95% confidence interval is 0.2061 and 0.3589,
respectively, which did not contain 0, 6 = 0.2282, indi-
cating that the mediating effect of relatedness needs is
significant. Finally, when analyzing the mediating effect
of self-enhancement motivation between relatedness
needs and UGC intention, the test results showed that
the confidence interval of Bootstrap test under 95% con-
fidence interval is 0.1480 and 0.3187, respectively, which
did not include 0, 6 = 0.2282, indicating that self-
enhancement motivation mediates the relationship
between two factors. Based on the above test results, hy-
potheses H8, H9, and H10 are supported.

4.1 Interaction modes of network users

User-generated content (UGC) refers to the content in
the form of text, pictures, and video that users voluntar-
ily release on various network platforms [48] exposing
user’s personal opinions, feelings, and thoughts [49]. En-
terprises establish various forms of virtual brand com-
munities to create environments for content creation of
users [50]. As SD theory suggests, motivated users con-
sistently produce higher-quality content [51, 52]. The

brand community brings great convenience to the users’
positive SE [53, 54).

Figure 3 (a) shows an interaction scenario of users of
UGC (video, text, pictures, etc.) in a virtual brand commu-
nity. It consists of three users, including user a, user b,
and user c. The interaction modes of these three users in
the virtual community can be divided into direct inter-
action and indirect interaction [55]. In the form of direct
interaction, they can directly interact information with
everyone. Indirect interaction means that the interaction
between the two parties can only be reached by a third
party. Therefore, user a will interact with user c indirectly
through user b, i.e., user a-user c and other forms.

User, 2: = {user a, user b, user c}

Interaction, se, 2: = {Interactiongjrect » Interactionindirect}

Figure 3 (b) shows a network view of the interaction
mode of users in the virtual brand community. It con-
sists of two main views, the logical view and the network
view. The logical view, shown in Fig. 3 (b), reflects the
Interactiong;e¢¢ and Interactionjpgirece Modes between
users. The network view is a multi-dimensional view of
a network space where users interact with each other
based on the change of time, location, and transmission

of different types of content (video, voice, thumb up,
reply, etc.).

Figure 4 shows a graph of user interaction mode based
on Cloud computing [56]. The interaction among the
users of the virtual brand community is connected to the
Cloud through the network and forms a comprehensive
platform together with the “cloud” of the Cloud. Users’ re-
quests for interaction need to be sent to the Cloud plat-
form first, which is distributed to different machines for
simultaneous processing, and then files (video, text, pic-
tures, etc.) are sent to users when they request content.
This interactive mode can process a large number of user
requests and data at the same time, which is suitable for
enterprise promotion, but it has the defects of delay in de-
livery speed and user experience service. Furthermore, this
resource can be wasteful when it does not require a large
number of simultaneous data requests.

sources are always paid or used with cost, to implement

motivation in the virtual brand community, we will need
to specify the technological concerns to optimize any
concrete application of an internalization project. In this
work, we give a focus to the adaptation of the workload
balance in terms of the inter-conversion between Cloud
and Edge computing [57].

Figure 5 shows a graph of user interaction mode based
on Edge computing [57]. Through the user interaction
mode based on Cloud computing shown in Fig. 4, al-
though multiple users’ simultaneous requests can be proc-
essed at the same time, different formats of data requests
and the connection of a large number of sensors, intelli-
gent terminals, and other network Edge devices produce a
large amount of real-time data. Putting requests such as
data analysis and processing in the Cloud at the same time
will not only bring expensive broadband costs, but also re-
duce response speed and availability.

Edge computing interaction mode is a service mode
that provides Edge intelligence service nearby, prefetch
and cache network data near user nodes, satisfies user

real-time data request processing, and improves cus-
tomer experience through ultra-low latency. Depending
on individual nodes that do not form the network, peer-
to-peer transmission of traffic flow through the Cloud is
required when running its nodes. Through this mode,
we can find that the speed of user interaction is im-
proved and the cost is reduced. Not only that but differ-
ent forms of interaction can make a_ significant
difference. As shown in the figure, in the process of user
interaction, if the service mode based on Cloud comput-
ing is adopted, communication in the form of video call
for 10 min will consume 1 Mb of bandwidth and cost 2
yuan. Using the Edge computing service mode for com-
munication for 1 h, the cost is reduced to 0.2 yuan/Mb,
compared with 1/6 of the cost of Cloud computing.
Transferring 300 Mb video to the Cloud between users
requires 1-Mb bandwidth and costs 3 yuan. To Edge, the
cost is 0.3 yuan.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the shifting from
Cloud to Edge computing bidirectionally can potentially

both reduce the cost and shorten the time. So, through
employing this conversion mode, potentially the inter-
action between users will be more frequent, experience
is more satisfying, and they are more willing to partici-
pate in the interaction. This obvious difference is not
only reflected in the interactive forms of video and other
texts, but also in the attention of commodities, reply to
posts, thumb up, and other interactive behaviors. The
UGC behavior model based on Edge computing will
make more users have the intention to participate, and
the interactive content tends to aggregate. For user pre-
cipitation, high-quality users will be more and more.

5 Simulation

5.1 Experiment setup

To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method,
we evaluated the design of our proposed solution
through numerical simulation. In the simulation Edge
architecture, we designed a smart city model, which con-
tains multiple distributed sensors. They collect data and
retrieve information bases and reasoning based on a re-
pository, so as to build an attribute database that deter-
mines the difference of personnel types. Some of them
are the information we obtained through the survey in
Section 3. According to the different SC, tested data
representing various people are roughly divided into two
types, the user with IDP-SC or ITD-SC. We deployed a
position sensor to collect data such as location and mov-
ing trail of personnel, deployed a video sensor to collect
visual data, and then analyzed the collected data to build
the attributes database. We determine the types of users
by their interaction frequency (including receiving mes-
sage (RM), collecting information (Ci), sending message
(SM), follow-up (Fu), thumb up), as shown in Fig. 6.

IDP-SC users gyy- <r equency

(Everything)>

(2020) 2020:14 Page 11 of 17

We set three parameters, including the change value
of each attribute of the user (AAttributen””*), the
weight of the personal attribute (Attributen”“®"), and
user type. In order to facilitate calculation, we set the
change value of the personal attribute to the scope be-
tween - 1 and 1. We parameterize the type of user; that
is, we assume that the value of the most independent
self-type user is — 1 and that of the most interdependent
self-type user is 1 under ideal conditions (please refer to
Table 6 for parameter settings).

We evaluated the design process of our proposed solu-
tion through numerical simulation, and presented it in
the form of algorithm, as shown in Table 7.

We design three experiments to prove that our pro-
posed method is feasible. In experiment 1, we consider
how a change in a single attribute (e.g., the number of
Edge nodes) will affect the type of user. In experiment 2,
we consider the corresponding relations between related
data for all attributes and the types of user. In experi-
ment 3, we analyzed the error of the experiment during
the test. In experiment 4, we discussed the cost of chan-
ging the value of personal attribute.

5.2 Analysis on results

In experiment 1, we validate our proposed method by
changing the number of Edge nodes near the people. As
shown in Fig. 7, we can select any point as the initial
type value for the user, such as the point on the far left.
We can change the current type value of the user by in-
creasing or decreasing the number of Edge nodes or in-
creasing the weight of attribute value. It demonstrates
that the method we proposed is feasible. Figure 7 also
shows the type of user is relative, that is, relatively IDP-
SC users or relatively ITD-SC users.

Still taking the point on the far left as an example, when
we keep the weight of the attribute value of its Edge node
unchanged and increase its attribute value, we can map
Table 6 to the two-dimensional plane and know the process
that its personnel type value will slowly increase from near
— 1 to near 1 and then continue to decrease to near - 1. For
example, when there is only one family in a village, the lack
of communication is manifested as relatively independent

users. Then, by increasing the number of Edge nodes, since
the convenience of personnel communication is greatly en-
hanced, the personnel type of users will gradually be chan-
ged from IDP-SC to ITD-SC. For another case, if we take
the village as a city, its personnel type may be changed be-
tween ITD-SC and IDP-SC through increasing or decreas-
ing the Edge nodes. We verify this with the hypotheses that
neighbors do not know each other in big cities. In

node is increased, all other corresponding attributes will be
changed, including communication mode and tool. There
are many independent self-users in our simulated cities.
Therefore, our proposed method is effective in terms of
changing user types through manipulation of the distribu-
tion and amount of Edge nodes and Cloud processing.

In experiment 3, we verified the data obtained in Sec-
tion 3, as shown in Fig. 9. We did ten sets of data tests,
in which the solid dots represent the real data obtained
from the survey in Section 3, and the hollow dots repre-
sent the simulation data we obtained through simulation
calculation in experiment 2. The results show that our
error rate is acceptable, so the method we proposed is
feasible.

In experiment 4, we consider the cost of changing the
value and weight of an attribute. As shown in Fig. 10, we
define the indicators such as cost, and the calculation of
its value covering the transition between Edge computing
and Cloud computing. Based on Fig. 10, we observe that
there are different costs between transferring a user type
to IDP-SC or IDP-SC-. It is harder to transfer a user from
IDP-SC to IDP-SC than from IDP-SC to IDP-SC. In ex-
periment 4, we show determination on whether to per-
form a type conversion of users based on its cost. For
example, when promoting products in the virtual brand
community, interdependent self-users are the main con-
sumer group of this product. The enterprise can consider
the cost to decide in which way, namely, the attribute of
personnel should lead the user to transform from the in-
dependent self-type to the interdependent self-type.

6 Results and discussion

The huge amount of knowledge, content, and open and
equal communication environment brought by the Inter-
net significantly reduce the psychological burden of
users, thus showing more obvious SC characteristics
than in the offline real environment, and even generating
different needs and motivations. Network IDP-SC users
pursue RNs. ITD-SC users pursue SE. Our work cre-
atively introduces the SC theory into the internalization
of the motivation of virtual brand community participa-
tion, which provides a fresh perspective for the motiv-
ation research of the brand community in a social
network. Previous studies have mostly considered the re-
lationship between internal motivation and the IDP-SC,
while the research on the ITD-SC considers its relation-
ship with external motivation [52]. Although a few stud-
ies have cross-considered the relationship between
different SC and motivations, results may be different
from the theory due to the social nature of the virtual
brand community. Based on an empirical investigation,
from surveyed data, we identified the personal character-
istics of users that affect the internalization of UGC mo-
tivation in the virtual brand community in the current
Cloud-dominating networking framework. As Brodie
et al. suggested, the virtual brand community is a kind
of virtual organizations, members need to accept the
community and the value of the brand concept, establish
social relationships with other members, involve in the
community, especially the IDP-SC users [14]. The reason
why the community is able to attract them to participate

in and conduct UGC behavior is largely because the re-
lational network can well meet its internal motivation.
Based on SC theory and SD theory and our conducted
data analysis, we found that, in the virtual brand commu-
nity in the current Cloud environment, IDP-SC users have
RNs while ITD-SC users have stronger RNs. If viewed
through the attributes of the virtual brand community, the
above phenomenon can be explained as that the core asset
of virtual brand community is in proportion to the
strength of the interaction and communication between
enterprises and users through the networking facilities,
and between users and users mediated through created
content, thus forming a set of social relations [43, 59].
Therefore, the pursuit of satisfying the RNs of users and
strengthen the associations between users has become the
main target of enterprises. For network ITD-SC users,
they are eager to integrate into the network group and
maintain harmony and close communication with net-
worked others. The existence of the virtual brand commu-
nity in the Cloud exactly provides them with this scene.
Network IDP-SC users have a stronger desire to establish
a positive identification or identity in the virtual brand
community, to show their own professional knowledge
and status. They often achieve their identity through UGC
behavior mechanism in a networked community, such as
following, liking, reply, and collection. That is to say, the
RNs of IDP-SC users are more based on those who can
promote the behavior of the SE, because it meets their
narcissism tendency [58] and the pursuit of their own
unique and individuals’ positive affirmation and evaluation

to themselves. IDP-SC users seek to establish its own cen-
tered relationship network in the community. On the
other hand, this also confirms the view that IDP-SC users
will actively seek to establish social relations after perceiv-
ing fun and value [30]. Previous studies often conclude
that ITD-SC users have a high tendency of external motiv-
ation. However, based on our survey, we found that the
patterns embodied in the collected data correspond to
that in the virtual brand community, ITD-SC also has a
strong internal motivation of SE, and the RNs plays an im-
portant intermediary role.

The RNs of community users can enhance UGC
intention through SE of this internal motivation, which
further confirms the view of SD theory; that is, the satis-
faction of basic psychological needs plays an important
nutritional role in the internal motivation of users and
then affects the behavioral intention of users. Therefore,
enhanced network bandwidth, shortened time delay be-
tween communications, more ensured availability of net-
worked content and resource, and strengthened network
robustness can provide a foundation for adjustment of
the strength of the association among users and there-
fore potentially converting between IDP-SC and ITD-SC
in terms of UGC behavior details. From a technical per-
spective, adaptation and deployment of emerging appli-
cations of Edge computing can fulfill the function of
adjustment of the network bandwidth, communication
time delay, and resource availability and performance,
among networked users, with a remarkably lower facility
cost or investment.

7 Research conclusions and future directions

By introducing the self-determination (SD) theory and
combining the relationship attribute of the virtual brand
community in inter-Cloud and Edge conversions and
adaptation, this study creatively investigated the related-
ness needs (RNs) with different types of self-construal
(SC) of users from an information implementation per-
spective. Based on the empirical survey, our analysis has
revealed how the user’s personality traits affect the in-
ternalization of motivation through relatedness needs
(RNs), which makes up for the deficiency of the internal-
ization of motivation in previous studies and further ex-
pands the application scope of self-determination (SD)
theory. Hereafter, we create a simulation of the inter-
Cloud and Edge conversions of the interactions among
various SC users with MATLAB to validate the feasibil-
ity of our proposed conversion mechanism between
interdependent self-construal (ITD-SC) and independent
self-construal (IDP-SC) users to reach the goal of ma-
nipulating the amount and the quality of UGC to serve
the business or social goals. Future research may con-
sider using more sophisticated experimental methods to
precisely initiate users’ self-construal (SC) types and val-
idate the simulation with a large scale of field data with
multiple countries, regions, industries, and brands to im-
prove the representativeness. Future research will also
consider more types of internal motivation and study
the differences among various motivations of users.
