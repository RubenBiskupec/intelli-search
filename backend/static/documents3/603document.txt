Abstract

Epilepsy is a serious chronic neurological disorder, can be detected by analyzing the brain signals produced by brain
neurons. Neurons are connected to each other in a complex way to communicate with human organs and generate
signals. The monitoring of these brain signals is commonly done using Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocor-
ticography (ECoG) media. These signals are complex, noisy, non-linear, non-stationary and produce a high volume of
data. Hence, the detection of seizures and discovery of the brain-related knowledge is a challenging task. Machine
learning classifiers are able to classify EEG data and detect seizures along with revealing relevant sensible patterns

without compromising performance. As such, various researchers have developed number of approaches to seizure
detection using machine learning classifiers and statistical features. The main challenges are selecting appropriate
classifiers and features. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the wide varieties of these techniques over
the last few years based on the taxonomy of statistical features and machine learning classifiers—'black-box’ and
‘non-black-box' The presented state-of-the-art methods and ideas will give a detailed understanding about seizure
detection and classification, and research directions in the future.

1 Introduction

The word epilepsy originates from the Latin and Greek
word ‘epilepsia’ which means ‘seizure’ or ‘to seize upon:
It is a serious neurological disorder with unique charac-
teristics, tending of recurrent seizures [1]. The context of
epilepsy, found in the Babylonian text on medicine, was
written over 3000 years ago [2, 3]. This disease is not lim-
ited to human beings, but extends to cover all species of
mammals such as dogs, cats and rats. However, the word
epilepsy does not give any types of clues about the cause
or severity of the seizures; it is unremarkable and uni-
formly distributed around the world [1, 41.

Several theories about the cause are already available.
The main cause is electrical activity disturbance inside
a brain [1, 5, 6], which could be originated by several
reasons [7] such as malformations, shortage of oxygen
during childbirth, and low sugar level in blood [8, 9].
Globally, epilepsy affects approximately 50 million peo-
ple, with 100 million being affected at least once in their
lifetime [5, 10]. Overall, it accounts for 1% of the world’s
burden of diseases, and the prevalence rate is reported
at 0.5-1% [4, 11]. The main symptom of epilepsy is to
experience more than one seizure by a patient. It causes
a sudden breakdown or unusual activity in the brain that
impulses an involuntary alteration in a patient’s behav-
iour, sensation, and loss of momentary consciousness.
Typically, seizures last from seconds to a few minute(s),
and can happen at any time without any aura. This leads
to serious injuries including fractures, burns, and some-
times death [12].

1.1 Seizure type

Based on the symptoms, seizures are categorized by
neuro-experts into two main categories—partial and
generalized [7, 13]—as shown in Fig. 1. Partial seizure,
also called ‘focal seizure, causes only a section of the cer-
ebral hemisphere to be affected. There are two types of
Partial seizure: simple-partial and complex-partial. In the
simple-partial, a patient does not lose consciousness but
cannot communicate properly. In the complex-partial, a
person gets confused about the surroundings and starts
behaving abnormally like chewing and mumbling; this is
known as ‘focal impaired awareness seizure. On the con-
trary, in the generalized seizures, all regions of the brain
suffer and entire brain networks get affected quickly
[14]. Generalized seizures are of many types, but they
are broadly divided into two categories: convulsive and
non-convulsive.

1.2 Main contributions of the paper
In brief, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. We have done the review according to five main
dimensions. First, researchers who adopted the
EEG, ECoG or both for seizure detection; second,
significant features; third, machine learning classifi-
ers; fourth, the performance of the classifier during
a seizure, and last, knowledge discovery (e.g., seizure
localization).

2. Through study, it has been explored that an ensemble
of decision trees (i.e., decision forest—random forest)
classifier outperforms other classifiers (ANN, KNN,
SVM, single Decision Tree).

2 Role of data scientists in epileptic seizure
detection
Applications of machine learning are significantly seen
on health and biological data sets for better outcomes
[15, 16]. Researchers/scientists on different areas, spe-
cifically, data mining and machine learning, are actively
involved in proposing solutions for better seizure detec-
tion. Machine learning has been significantly applied to
discover sensible and meaningful patterns from different
domain datasets [17, 18]. It plays a significant and poten-
tial role in solving the problems of various disciplines like
healthcare [17, 19-25]. Applications of machine learn-
ing can also be seen on brain datasets for seizure detec-
tion, epilepsy lateralization, differentiating seizure sates,
and localization [26-29]. This has been done by various
machine learning classifiers such as ANN, SVM, decision
tree, decision forest, and random forest [26, 28].
Certainly, in the past, numerous reviews have been car-
ried out on seizure detection along with applied features,
classifiers, and claimed accuracy [27, 30-33] without
focusing on the challenges faced by the data scientists
whilst doing research on datasets of neurological disor-
ders. Therefore, this article provides a detailed study of
machine learning applications on epileptic seizure detec-
tion and other related knowledge discovery tasks. In this
review, the collected articles are from well-known jour-
nals of their relevant field. These references are either
indexed by SCOPUS or Web of Science (WOS). Besides,

Page 3 of 18

we also considered some good ranked conference papers.
Extensive literature is available covering the deep analy-
sis of different features and classifiers applied on EEG
datasets for seizure detection [31, 34, 35]. Both, feature
extraction and applying classification techniques are
challenging tasks. Previous literature reveals that for
the past few years, interest has been increased in the
application of machine learning classifiers for extract-
ing meaningful patterns from EEG signals, which helps
for detecting seizures, its location in the brain, and other
impressive related knowledge discoveries [28, 36, 37].
Three decades ago, Jean Gotman [6, 38-40], analyzed
and proposed the model for effective usage of EEG sig-
nals by applying different computational and statistical
techniques for automatic seizure detection. Furthermore,
the research has been carried out by different signal pro-
cessing methods and data science methods to provide
better outcomes [27, 34, 41—47].

3 A framework for seizure detection

In this section, we present a pictorial framework of the
model used for seizure detection from an EEG/ECoG
seizure dataset, illustrated in Fig. 2. The process com-
prises four steps: Data Collection, Data Preparation,
Applying Machine Learning Classifiers and Performance
Evaluation.

3.1 Data collection

The initial requirement is to collect the dataset of brain
signals. For this, different monitoring tools are used.
Typically, the mostly used devices are EEG and ECoG,
because their channels or electrodes are implanted by
glue on the surface of the scalp as per 10—20 International

system [48] at different lobes. Each of them has a wire
connection to the EEG device, providing timely informa-
tion about the variations in voltage, along with temporal
and spatial information [49]. As highlighted in Fig. 2, the
EEG channels are placed on the subject’s scalp, and the
electrical signals are read by the EEG monitoring tool
and it displays these raw signals over the screen. Fur-
ther, these raw signals have been carefully monitored by
the analyst and classified into ‘seizure’ and ‘non-seizure’
states.

3.2 Data transformation

After data collection, the next crucial step is to transform
the signal data into a 2-D Table format. The reason for
this is to make it easier for analysis and provide neces-
sary knowledge like seizure detection. This datum is raw
because it has not been processed yet. Therefore, it will
not be suitable to give relevant information. To do the
processing, different feature selection modalities have
been applied. This step also presents the dataset as super-
vised, which means that it provides the class attribute
with possible class-values.

3.3 Dataset preparation
For data transformation, data processing is a decisive step
to extract meaningful information from the collected raw
dataset. As such, different feature extraction techniques
have been used; as shown in Table 1. These methods are
generally applied to the extracted EEG signal dataset [31,
34]. The raw dataset becomes rich in terms of different
statistical measure values.

After feature extraction processing, the dataset
becomes more informative that it ultimately helps the
classifier for retrieving better knowledge.

3.4 Applying machine learning classifiers

and performance evaluation
To achieve a high accuracy of seizure detection rate and
explore relevant knowledge from the EEG processed
dataset, different supervised and unsupervised machine
learning have been used.

3.4.1 Classification

In classification, a dataset D has a set of ‘non-class attrib-
utes, and a ‘class attribute: They are the principal com-
ponents and their pertinent knowledge is very important,
as both have a strong association for potential classifica-
tion. The target attribute is defined as the ‘class attrib-
ute’ C, and it comprises more than one class values,
e.g., seizure and non-seizure. On the contrary, attributes
A = {Aj,A2.A3...A,} are known as ‘non-class attributes’
or predictors [50, 51]. The following classifiers have been
popularly used in seizure detection. Common classifiers
such as SVM [52], decision tree [53] and decision forest
[54] are applied to the processed EEG dataset for seizure
detection.

3.4.2 Performance evaluation

The accuracy of the obtained results is used to evaluate
different methods. The most popular training approach
is tenfold cross-validation [55], where each fold, i.e., one
horizontal segment of the dataset is considered to be the
testing dataset and the remaining nine segments are used
as the training dataset [56, 57].

Except for the accuracy, the performance of the classifi-
ers is commonly measured by the following metrics such
as precision, recall, and f-measure [58]. These are based
on four possible classification outcomes—True-Positive
(TP), True-Negative (TN), False-Positive (FP), and False-
Negative (FN) as presented in Table 2.

Precision is the ratio of true-positives to the total
number of cases that are detected as positive (TP+FP).

Despite getting the high Recall results of the classifier,
it does not indicate that the classifier performs well in
terms of precision. As a result, it is mandatory to calcu-

this measure is known as F-measure score, shown in
Eq. 3. The false- positives and the false-negatives are taken
into account. Generally, it is more useful than accuracy,
especially when the dataset is imbalanced.

4 Publicly available datasets

For data scientists and researchers, a dataset used is
important for evaluating the performance of their pro-
posed models. Similarly, in epileptic seizure detection,
we need to capture the brain signals. EEG recording is
the most used method for monitoring brain activity.
These recordings play a vital role in machine learning
classifiers to explore the novel methods for seizure detec-
tion in different ways such as onset seizure detection,
quick seizure detection, patient seizure detection, and
seizure localization. The significance of publicly available
datasets is that they provide a benchmark to analyze and
compare the results to others. In the following section,
we will describe the popular datasets that are widely used
on epilepsy.

4.1 Children Hospital Boston, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology—EEG dataset

This dataset is publicly available on a physionet server
and prepared at Children Hospital Boston, Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) [59, 60]. It can
be collected easily via Cygwin tool which interacts with
the physionet server. It contains the number of seizure
and non-seizure EEG recordings for each patient of the
CHB [61]. The dataset comprises 23 patients; 5 males,
aged 3-22 years, and 17 females aged 1.5-19. Each
patient contains multiple seizure and non-seizure record-
ing files in European data format (.edf), representing the
spikes with seizure start and end time, which is easily
visible at a browser called an “‘EDFbrowser: The primary
datasets are in the 1-D format, containing EEG signals
that are obtained through the different types of channels
that were placed on the surface of the brain as per 10-20
International System. All these signals of the dataset were
sampled at the frequency of 256Hz.

4.2 ECoG Dataset, Epilepsy Centre, University of California
This is a publicly available dataset of electrocorticogram
(ECoG) signals from an epileptic patient, which was col-
lected from the Epilepsy Center, University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) [62]. It was originally collected
by implanting 76 electrodes on the scalp in both inva-
sive (12-electrodes) and non-invasive manner (64-elec-
trodes). It comprises 16 files altogether. Out of these,
eight files (F1,F2,---F8) are classified as ‘pre-ictal’
meaning the stage before the seizure. The rest of the files
(F9,F10,F11,---F16) represent the ‘ictal’ stage data.
The collected data are sampled at the frequency of 400
Hz (i.e., 400 cycles/s) and the total duration is 10s. As a
result, there are (400 cycles/s x10 s) 4000 cycles in each
file [63].

4.3 The Freiburg—EEG dataset

This dataset was collected from the invasive EEG record-
ings of 21 patients (8 males aged 13-47 years, 13 females
aged 10-50 years) suffering from medically intractable
focal epilepsy. It was recorded during an invasive pre-
surgical epilepsy monitoring at the Epilepsy Centre of
Siddiqui et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:5

the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany [64]. Out
of 21 patients, 13 patients had 24 h of recordings, and 8
patients had less than 24 h. These recordings are inter-
ictal, and together they provide 88 seizures.

4.4 Bonn University—EEG dataset

The dataset comprises five subsets, where each one
denoted as (A-E) contains 100 single-channels record-
ing, and each of them has a 23.6 s duration, captured by
the international 10-20 electrode placement scheme.
All the signals are recorded with the same 128-channel
amplifier system channel [65].

4.5 BERN-BARCELONA—EEG dataset

This dataset comprised EEG recordings derived from five
pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients with
3750 focal and 3750 non-focal bivariate EEG files. Three
patients were seizure-free, with two patients only having
auras but no other seizures following surgery. The multi-
channel EEG signals were recorded with an intracranial
strip and depth electrodes. The 10—20 positioning was
used for the electrodes’ implantation. EEG signals were
either sampled at 512 or 1024 Hz, depending on whether
they were recorded with more or less than 64 channels.
According to the intracranial EEG recordings, they were
able to localize the brain areas where seizures started for
all five patients [66]. This dataset is good for the seizure
localization purpose.

5 Seizure detection based on statistical features
and machine learning classifiers

This section explains the comprehensive detail of work
on seizure detection using statistical features, classifi-
ers—‘black-box’ and ‘non-black-box: They are illustrated
in Table 3. In brief, the ‘black-box’ classifiers are those
which provide the accuracy without mentioning the rea-
sons behind the results such as ANN and SVM [67]. They
are unable to explain their classification steps. Whereas,
‘non-black-box’ classifiers such as decision forest and
random forest can able to explain each step of the pro-
cessing, which is human-understandable. As a result, it
helps in human-interpretable knowledge with high accu-
racy [68].

5.1 Seizure detection based on statistical features

If we apply machine learning classifier(s) directly to raw
EEG/ECoG datasets, it may not produce enough sensible
patterns. Therefore, selecting significant and capable sta-
tistical features from EEG and ECoG raw datasets is one
of the challenges and a crucial task. The nature of EEG
and ECoG signals is very complex, non-stationary and
time-dependent [105-107]. As such, we can apply the

Page 6 of 18

machine learning classifier(s) to the processed datasets,
which will ultimately assist to solve various neurological
problems; for example, identifying seizure’s stages, accu-
rate seizure detection, fast detection, etc. In Table 3, we
summarize a review of several studies.

The significant statistical features were extracted by
different types of transformation techniques; discrete
wavelet transformations (DWT), continuous wavelet
transformation (CWT), Fourier transformation (FT),
discrete cosine transformation (DCT), singular value
decomposition (SVD), intrinsic mode function (IMF),
and time-frequency domain from EEG datasets [34,
71, 79, 108]. Logesparan et al. [34] used different types
of feature extraction methods for seizure detection, but
they reported that two features—'‘line length’ and ‘relative
power’—are the good performers for seizure detection.
Guerrero-Mosquera [109] applied three time-domain
features—line length, frequency, and energy on the raw
EEG dataset. These features claim to be suitable for sei-
zure detection and other brain-related applications such
as computer interface (BCI). The claimed performance
was evaluated using the following metrics such as sen-
sitivity, specificity, F-score, receiver operating character-
istics (ROC) curve, and percentile bootstrap measures.
Duo Chen [84] used DWT with the SVM classifier on
two benchmark datasets—CHB-MIT and Bonn Univer-
sity, achieved seizure detection accuracies of 92.30% and
99.33%, respectively. Ramy Hussein et al. [100] proposed
a new featured Ll-penalized robust regression (L1PRR)
for seizure detection, the issue with their approach is
computational complexity. Zavid and Paul [99] focused
on classifying the ‘ictal’ and ‘inter-ictal’ states, where they
used four features DCT, DCT-DWT, SVD, and IMF; the
obtained signals are further classified by LS-SVM due to
less computational cost.

Several researchers have contributed to seizure detec-
tion using a single feature [108, 110]. The feature ‘line
length’ [108, 110] was applied to an EEG dataset; approx-
imately 4.1 s of mean detection latency is recorded at a
false alarm rate of 0.051 Fp/h. Further, Guo et al. [69] also
used ‘line length’ but with the ANN for classifying the
records obtained by EEG signals. Their automated seizure
detection accuracy is 99.6%. A system was proposed by
Koolen et al. [70] to detect seizures from EEG recordings.
This detection system uses a single feature—‘line length’
The performance of this system shows 84.27% accuracy,
84.00% sensitivity and 85.70% specificity, which are com-
paratively lower than the results of Guo et al. [69].

After 3 years of study on several of statistical features
[34], Logesparan et al. [71] proposed the ‘line length’ fea-
ture for normalization and discrimination of class values
from EEG datasets. It is noted that ‘line length’ could be
taken as the strongest feature and provides considerable

output. Based on previous studies, the ‘line length’ can
be taken with other features, and the result would be
more promising, specifically in machine learning. ‘This is
because the dataset dimension would also increase with
meaningful statistical information in the attributes.

Some other studies on seizure detection based on a sin-
gle feature, i.e., entropy and its sub-types such as approx-
imate entropy (AE) and sample entropy (SE), have also
been done [45, 72, 73, 111]. The entropy feature helps
to find the random behaviour of EEG signals and takes
depth benefits in measuring the impurity of the signals
[112, 113]. The entropy feature has been used widely
where data are in the form of signals such as ECG, [114],
EEG, and ECoG [36]. This helps in further steps of the
detection model.

Acharya et al. [111] used four different types of
entropy-based features: sample entropy, approximate
entropy, phase entropy (S1), and phase entropy (S2)
of the EEG datasets. The processed dataset from these
entropy features was used for seizure detection. In
another study, Chen et al. [90] used eight different kinds
of entropy feature—approximate, sample, spectral, fuzzy,
permutation, Shannon, conditional and correction condi-
tional on a raw EEG dataset; further, the processed data
were classified into three class values: ‘ictal, ‘inter-ictal’
and ‘normal stage, and their accuracy is 99.50%. A tool
was proposed by Selvakumari et al. [89] using four fea-
tures—entropy, root mean square (RMS), variance, and
energy. Based on these features, the detection was done
using SVM and naive Bayesian classifiers with a reported
accuracy of 95.63%. The tool is also able to find the sei-
zure region in the brain; however, they did not mention
the exact percentage of seizure location. Song and Li [72]
built classification models by two classifiers—Extreme
Learner Machine (ELM) and the back-propagation neu-
ral network (BPNN). Overall, their findings show 95.6%
of classification accuracy with less execution time. Yong
Zhang et al. [73] applied two entropy features—AE and
SE on two different classifiers—ELM and SVM for pro-
cessing EEG dataset. The SE features with ELM provide
good classification accuracy compared to the AE feature
whilst detecting the seizure.

The energy feature has been significantly used in sei-
zure detection [115]. It plays a vital role particularly when
the seizure is detected by the epoch- or windows-based
method. This means that the EEG signals are divided into
various segments [79, 94]. An exponential energy feature
has been introduced by Fasil and Rajesh [97], which helps
in identifying the irregularities in amplitude EEG signals.

Observations This section has provided an overview of
the contributions of statistical features to seizure detec-
tion and their importance. Some researchers detect sei-
zures using multiple sets of features, whilst others select
a single feature such as ‘line length: We recommend the
‘line length’ feature to be in the list of the set of suit-
able features for seizure detection because it is helpful in
measuring the EEG signals complexity. It plays a sensi-
tive role in the changes at the frequency and amplitude
of signals. As a result, it helps to discriminate against the
‘seizure’ and ‘non-seizure’ cases. However, from the data
science point of view, it is very important to see the vari-
ous perspectives of each brain signals by observing other
statistical features. Furthermore, we also suggest not to
use the irrelevant feature(s) as they will unnecessarily
increase the dataset size which results in an increase in
computational time and gives insensible patterns too. As
a result, it becomes a hassle to machine learning classi-
fiers and users rather than providing the benefit. Some
researchers [95, 98, 101] used a large number of features,
which increases the attribute size, and results in more
computational time and less accuracy. So, if we take the
fewer features as previous researchers have done [71, 73,
79] this will give the low-dimensional dataset, which will
not be fruitful for the knowledge discovery process. The
next section illustrates the seizure detection by ‘black-
box’ classifiers. As far as the classification purpose is con-
cerned, it would be better to take more relevant statistical
features, which can be integrated into knowledge discov-
ery and a good performance rate.

5.2 Seizure detection based on black-box classifiers

The classifiers such as SVM, ANN, and KNN are consid-
ered as prominent ones due to their remarkable perfor-
mances in different domains [67, 116]. Each technique
Siddiqui et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:5

has its pros and cons, and ‘black-box’ methods are not an
exception to this [104]. Even though these classifiers con-
tribute well to brain datasets, some of the relevant works
on seizure detection using these classifiers are reported
here.

The study of Satapathy et al. [85] was based on two
‘black-box’ approaches—SVM and Neural networks
using different kernel methods for seizure detection
against a large EEG dataset. The performance of each
classifier is measured independently by the majority vot-
ing system, and it was found that SVM was more capable
than other neural networks. Subasi et al. [87] proposed
the solution to detect seizure using a hybrid approach of
SVM, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm opti-
mization (PSO). The method achieved impressive accu-
racy, ie., 99.38%, but the problem is that the classifier
trains the dataset twice, one for SVM-GA and another for
SVM-PSO. This could be a time-consuming.

Shoeb and Guttag [41] performed seizure detection
on their arranged dataset of Child Hospital Bostan,
MIT (CHB-MIT) [60] using SVM with the vector fea-
ture and achieved the estimated accuracy of 96%. Dorai
and Ponnambalam [42] came with an idea of the epoch,
which means dividing the dataset into smaller time
frames. Further, they applied an ensemble of four ‘black-
box’ approaches—LDA, KNN, CVE, and SVM on these
epoch EEG datasets. This approach provides the predic-
tion of onset seizures 65 s earlier. Classifying the EEG
data into two class ‘ ‘seizure” and ‘non-seizure, Birjand-
talab et al. [117] used a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
before detecting the seizure, and obtained 90% accu-
racy with 85.1% F-measure. They also raised the issue of
class imbalance in their dataset. Tzallas et al. [103] used
time—frequency-domain features with ANN for the EEG
dataset and obtained 100% accuracy for the ‘seizure’ and
‘non-seizure’ classification problem; with epochs’ data-
sets the accuracy is 97.7% from (A, B, C, and D) for ‘non-
seizure and set E for ‘seizure’ epoch classes. Amin et al.
[79] extracted relative energy features from the DWT
method, and four classifiers—SVM, MLP, KNN, and
Naive Bayes—were applied for the classification purpose,
the result shows 98% of SVM accuracy, which outper-
forms remaining classifiers. A framework had been pro-
posed by K. Abualsaud et al. [118] using the ensemble of
‘black-box’ classifiers for automated seizure detection on
noisy EEG signals, and the reported classification accu-
racy is 95%. However, the ensemble approach did not
provide good accuracy as desired because all four classi-
fiers were ‘black-box:

In 2018, Lahmiri et al. [92] used generalized Hurst
exponent (GHE) and KNN, to propose a system for
identifying the ‘seizure’ and ‘non-seizure’ classes from
intracranial EEG recordings, detection rate, with 100%

Page 9 of 18

accuracy rate. Further, Lahmiri et al. [43] exploited GHE
with SVM, to classify the ‘seizure’ and ‘non-seizure, and
also they found 100% accuracy in less time. Here, the
good indication is that authors claim the good accuracy
in less time for seizure detection. But, the authors did
not clearly define how many times the seizure can be
detected. In another study by Al Ghayab et al. [88], the
obtained accuracy is 100% as a result of using the con-
cept of Information gain theory, to extract and rank the
meaningful features from EEG signal dataset. The least
square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) is then applied
to classify the seizure cases. Moreover, due to the ‘black-
box”s nature of applied classifiers, the authors could not
explore any other related aspects in terms of Knowledge
discovery. Zabihi et al. [81] did patient-specific seizure
detection using SVM classifier on the processed dataset
with a good set of features, comprising time-domain, fre-
quency-domain, time—frequency domain, and non-linear
feature. The performance of their model has achieved an
average of 93.78% sensitivity and a specificity of 99.05%.
Here, it is noteworthy that they skip an important fea-
ture—‘line length, from the available literature, which
is prominently used in seizure detection. We also argue
that CHB-MIT dataset [60] is imbalanced because, in
an hour(s) of recording, a seizure time span is for a few
seconds.

Observations

The main issue with ‘black-box’ classifiers is that they
only make prediction without providing logic rules or
patterns. That is why, they are not recommended for
extracting sensible knowledge. For example, for class
imbalance issues in EEG datasets, insufficient related lit-
erature is found, and the researchers who attempted to
work on this problem did not provide a conceivable solu-
tion as to how to solve the class imbalance issue whilst
detecting the seizure.

5.3 Seizure detection based on non-black-box classifiers
‘Black-box’ classifiers are unable to express their classifi-
cation procedure for human interpretation [67, 104, 116].
Consequently, there are fewer chances for knowledge dis-
covery and better accuracy performance. Therefore, the
concept of ‘non-black-box’ classifiers such as decision
trees, and decision forests came into practice.

Chen et al. [119] first introduced the decision tree to
the EEG dataset for seizure detection. Kemal and Saleh
[120] used a C5.0 decision tree [121] algorithm to explore
the logic rules for seizure detection, with an average
accuracy of 75%. When the same C5.0 was applied to the
same dataset processed by Fourier transformation the
obtained accuracy with cross-validation was, however,
98.62%. A few related works are been available, where
only a decision tree method is applied seizure detection
Siddiqui et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:5

because of less accuracy and a limited number of patterns
obtained from the logic rules of a decision tree [122]. As
a result, both the knowledge discovery and accuracy suf-
fer. However, this gap can be filled by applying decision
forest approaches instead [51, 57, 123].

Through the literature, it is found that the decision for-
est approaches are more effective than the single decision
tree [57, 124], because the decision tree often gives a con-
fined set of rules and overfitting issue is also raised [68].
The rules are extracted from training data by a decision
tree that generates either limited or a single set of logic
rules (Say, wherever C2_Entropy value < 101.01 then
Class_value = seizure) and stops growing the tree further
records in the training dataset once the rule is accepted.
However, if we generate a decision forest on the train-
ing data, we can achieve multiple sets of decision trees
with the combination of sensible logic rules and a higher
accuracy rate due to the majority voting method [57].
Decision forest classifiers [54, 68] are the type of ensem-
ble methods that are used frequently. These are also used
in seizure detection as they provide a high accuracy rate
which depends on the majority voting method from the
ensemble of decision trees. Moreover, they produce more
logic rules as multiple decision trees from the training
data (D) [123]. These logic rules are humanly interpret-
able, and data scientists can easily interrelate them with
other seizure-related information from EEG datasets.

Siddiqui and Islam [125] used Systematic Forest (SyS-
For) to detect the seizure on ECoG without epoch reduc-
tion. Further, Siddiqui et al. [63] applied two decision
forests—Systematic Forest (SysFor) [123] and Forest
CERN [51] on nine statistical features for quick seizure
detection using the concept of epoch length reduction.
It is based on dividing the size of training dataset D into
Dj, D2, ...Dy, and testing the accuracy at every epoch of
the dataset. These sub-datasets are in descending order
in terms of time duration. If the seizure can be detected
in a shorter epoch length without a decline in accuracy,
then we can use the same one, which results in fast sei-
zure detection. They achieved 100% accuracy. The limita-
tion of this work is that authors have taken the dataset
of a single patient, this could be tested for more patients.
Several researchers have taken the advantages of ran-
dom forest classifier for detecting the seizures [76, 78,
82, 126]. Because researchers/data scientists are able to
see the logic rules and interpret them correspondingly.
Moreover, it also provides good accuracy [44, 76—78, 80,
82]. Donos et al. [44] applied decision forest classifier—
random forest, on time and frequency domains’ feature,
which was extracted from an IEEG (Intra-cranial EEG)
dataset. It helped in selecting the intra-cranial channels
for early seizure detection in a closed-loop circuit. The
results claimed that the system can detect the seizure

Page 10 of 18

with 93.8% sensitivity. Wang et al. [94] developed the
greedy approach of random forest, i.e., forest-grid search
optimization (RF-GSO), with this method and they found
96.7% accuracy. The shortcoming of this technique is
that the performance could decline if EEG signals are
too noisy. Tzimourta et al. [93] applied random forest to
monitor seizure activities on the two benchmark epilepsy
datasets [64, 65], the reported performance is 99.74%.
Pinto-Orellana and Fabio R. Cerqueira [76] also used the
random forest on the processed CHB-MIT dataset by a
Spectro-temporal feature, and 70s, and the accuracy of
each block is 98.30%.

Truong ND et al. [82] had carried out novel work of
channel selection whilst detecting the seizure. Their key
contribution is that they also focus on channels contrib-
uting mostly to automatic seizure detection. They used
the random forest to solve channel selection and sei-
zure detection, and which achieving 96.94% area under
the curve (AUC). In another work, Mursalin et al. [80]
proposed a method for seizure detection by selecting
features with an Improved Correlation-based Feature
Selection(ICFS). Basically it is a fusion of time and fre-
quency domain. Then, a random forest classifier was
applied for the seizure detection model. The obtained
average classification accuracy by this approach was
98.75%.

Some other works have used an ensemble of ‘non-
black-box’ classifiers such as boosting, bagging and ran-
dom subspace [78, 127]. Yan et al. [78] applied a boosting
classifier achieving 94.26% of accuracy, although the
results were not as impressive as the ones obtained by
[44], which used a random forest classifier. Hosseini [128]
used Random subspace classifier along with an SVM clas-
sifier, to classify and detect seizures. Here, the benefit of
applying a subspace on big datasets is to divide them into
sub-datasets based on the random subspace concept, and
then the SVM classifier was applied to each sub-dataset.
Ensemble accuracy (EA) was calculated by the majority
voting method, which was 95%. Apart from this study,
the same authors of Hosseini et al. [126] recently did
another research using an ensemble of classifiers. First,
they created bootstrap samples using a random subspace
method, and then applied classifiers such as SVM, KNN,
extended nearest neighbor (ENN), and multilayer per-
ceptron (MLP) obtaining 97% accuracy. Hussein et al.
[100], proposed a novel feature extraction method, i.e.,
Ll-penalized robust regression (L1PRR), which uses
three common symptoms during seizures—muscles arti-
facts, eyes movement, and white noise. Inputting these
features help the random forest classifier to obtain 100%
accuracy.

Observations In comparison to decision trees, decision
forest classifiers are tremendously used on brain datasets
Siddiqui et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:5

for exploring different research goals. It is difficult to
suggest a particular classifier whilst dealing with a high-
dimensional dataset, but a random forest classifier can
be a capable classifier. However, it also criticizes that not
all the ‘non-black-box’ classifiers are peculiar to detect
seizures and have also pointed out the objection on the
drawback of using a single decision tree classifier.

5.4 Seizure detection based on black-box
and non-black-box machine learning classifiers

From the literature, it is found that just a single machine
learning classifier is not sufficient. Therefore, to take
advantage of both ‘black-box’ and ‘non-black-box’ clas-
sifiers, some researchers utilized them in their experi-
ments. This section provides a comprehensive review of
classifiers applied together to detect the seizure.

Acharya et al. [111] used the ensemble of seven dif-
ferent classifiers—Fuzzy surgeon classifier (FSC), SVM,
KNN, Probabilistic neural network, GMM, decision tree
and Naive Bayes for distinguishing the three states of a
patient as ‘normal, ‘pre-ictal’ and ‘ictal’ The overall accu-
racy is 98.1%. Fergus et al. [83] also used distinct classifi-
ers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant classifier (QDC), logistic classifier, uncorre-
lated normal density-based classifier (UDC), polynomial
classifier, KNN, PARZEN, SVM, and decision tree on
the processed data with seven features such as entropy,
RMS, skewness, and variance. They contributed that
the detected patient is suffering from a ‘Generalize sei-
zure’ (means affecting whole brain region) across differ-
ent patients without prior information about the seizure
focal points. Mursalin et al. [101] proposed a method to
reduce the data size, statistical sampling technique called
optimum sample allocation technique, and to reduce the
features they develop a feature selection algorithm. The
analysis was done on the combination of five classifiers—
SVM, KNN, NB, Logistic Model Trees (LMT) and Ran-
dom forest.

Rand and Sriram [95] used four classifiers such as
SVM, KNN, random forest, and Adaboost on a high-
dimensional dataset prepared by 28 features. Their result
shows that SVM outperforms on the cubic kernel. In
another study, Manzouri et al. [98] used SVM and ran-
dom forest on the dataset produced by 10-time and fre-
quency features. In comparison to SVM-based detector,
random forest classifier outperforms. Subasi et al. [96]
achieved 100% of accuracy using four machine learning
classifiers such as ANN, KNN, SVM, and random for-
est on two popular datasets—Freiburg and CHB-MIT
to classify the three different states of seizures ‘pre-ictal,
‘ictal; and ‘inter-ictal? Sharma et al. [102] proposed an
automated system using iterative filtering and random
forest for classifying the EEG signals. This work achieved

Page 11 of 18

classification accuracies of 99.5% on BONN dataset
(A-E), for A versus E subsets, 96% for D versus E sub-
sets, and 98.4% for ABCD versus E classes of EEG signals.
Birjandtalab et al. [77] used two classifiers for different
purposes; KNN is used to discriminate the ‘seizure’ and
‘non-seizure’ classes, whereas random forest is used to
explore the significant channels. Here, the random forest
also helps in the dimension reduction problem. The main
benefit of selecting suitable channels is that it helps in
providing relevant required information from the chosen
channels, and reduces the computational cost of a classi-
fier too. However, the authors did not mention here the
important information from channel selection like find-
ing the seizure location from the brain scalp. The main
critic in [95, 98, 101] is that because of a large number of
features, the attribute size of dataset will increases, and
as a result the accuracy and computation time suffer.

5.4.1 Observations

We observe that some work used an ensemble of dis-
tinguished classifiers to take the benefits separately. For
example, influential channel selection can be indepen-
dently done using decision forest classifiers like a random
forest. But authors used other classifiers such as SVM
and KNN for classifying the seizure records with good
accuracy.

6 Seizure localization
After a successful seizure detection, localization is an
essential task for epileptic surgery [129-131]. Typi-
cally, localized seizures can be cured by surgery which
arises either from the left or right region of the brain.
The seizure monitoring tools such as ECoG and EEG
are prominently helpful to identify the seizure location.
The electrodes/channels are implanted in a non-invasive
(for EEG) and an invasive manner (for ECoG). Their
positioning is based on the 10/20 (10-20) International
system, which helps in identifying the seizure location
[132]. The concept of seizure localization means identify-
ing the region of the brain affected by a seizure. Though
some types of seizures such as ‘tonic-clonic’ are cured by
anti-epileptic drugs (AED), patients with partial seizures
in some cases might go for surgery [13]. To solve this
problem, finding the seizure location is an essential and
challenging task for neurologists and neurosurgeon [129,
130]. The surgical target is to find a point/location/focal
area from where a seizure is originating. The 10—20 posi-
tioning system gives some clues for identifying the loca-
tion of a seizure. Recently, computational and machine
learning methods have been applied to identify a seizure
location [130, 133].

Acar et al. [133] used trucker and non-linear multi-way
Trucker kernels, and claimed that other classifiers such as
Siddiqui et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:5

SVD and principal component analysis (PCA) were una-
ble to localize a seizure. Ghannad-Rezaie [134] applied
an advanced swarm intelligence algorithm to seizure data
for finding seizure location. Their study produced some
appreciable results, and explored whether the patient’s
temporal lobe was affected by a seizure or not. They also
suggested that SVM might be able to detect the seizure
location. Moreover, they also focused on the reduction of
ECoG electrodes. Mansouri et al. [135] proposed an algo-
rithm for Seizure localization, which was tested on 10 sec
of EEG dataset from Karuniya University. Here, they have
taken the small-size dataset, because recording usually
takes several hours. If they had tested on a big dataset, it
would have been much better. Fakhraei et al. [130] calcu-
lated the sensitivity of each region of the brain. The confi-
dent prediction rate (CPR) was compared with the AUC of
ROC plots obtained by six classifiers from the dataset of 79
patients (31 males, 48 females) with 197 medical features.
The study found that CPR was more suitable than ROC.
They also explored that 43 patients had the temporal lobe
epilepsy (TLE) on their left sides whilst 36 patients had it
on the right sides of their brains. Likewise, Rai et al. [136]
proposed a method for identifying the focal points of the
seizure by applying two entropy-based features—‘renyi
entropy and ‘negentropy’ with the neural network classi-
fier. Siddiqui et al. [63] localize the seizure using two deci-
sion forest classifiers, and their results showed that the left
hemisphere of a brain was more affected by the seizures.

Observation

It is found that compared to seizure detection, machine
learning classifiers have not been extensively applied
for seizure localization. But some literature exist on this
problem. In these reported works, authors did not men-
tion the percentage of the affected region of the brain
by a seizure, and they were not able to identify the exact
location at the lobes such as occipital, frontal, parietal left
and parietal right. Although, it is not our primary objec-
tive in this review paper, whilst discussing the related
published research, we found some interesting clues for
seizure localization.

7 Problems identified in existing literature

One of the most significant and decisive steps is to select
suitable statistical features because each channel or elec-
trode implanted on the brain provides different statisti-
cal measures. Undoubtedly, earlier researchers made
their consistent efforts to find the best features. Whilst
some researchers used many features [34, 79], the others
applied a few features [31, 36, 108, 112, 137] for detect-
ing the seizure. As a data scientist, it is very important to
see the different statistical perspectives of each brain sig-
nal by analyzing the statistical properties of the features
such as entropy, energy, and skewness. And we must not

Page 12 of 18

focus on taking irrelevant feature(s) as such since it will
unnecessarily increase the dataset size. Consequently,
it will be more a burden to machine learning classifiers
than a benefit, and if we take few features as previous
researchers did [71, 73, 79], this will give the low-dimen-
sional dataset and it will not be beneficial for an effec-
tive knowledge discovery process. Therefore, we should
select those potential features that can to provide logical
results. Hence, it is advisable to select a group of features
to avoid a burden to the machine learning classifiers and
to get help in related knowledge discovery.

Each classifier has its own merits and demerits,
depending on the dataset attributes and requirements
[138]. In general, it is very difficult to point out which
classifier was the most effective for brain datasets. To
identify the capable classifier, several classifiers have
been tested on EEG datasets and their performance has
been evaluated, and the one which performs well is to
be considered in solving seizure detection and imparting
knowledge discovery. The literature reveals that previ-
ous researchers had applied different approaches, most
of which were from ‘black-box’ such as ANN, KNN and
SVM. The biggest shortcoming in them is that they are
unable to provide the appropriate explanations for pat-
terns and the logic rules hidden inside the models. ‘That
is why, they are not suggested for remarkable knowl-
edge discovery process. Data scientists may not explore
the internal processing of patterns [51, 104]. However,
from the literature, it is noted that the ‘non-black-box’
approach, especially, random forest, is widely used for
seizure detection [44, 76, 77], because of its nature of
generating bootstrap samples [124, 139] whilst building
a decision forest. An analysis has been done to estimate
the performance of machine learning classifiers on EEG
datasets and has been found that ensemble non-black-
classifiers performs effectively [104]. We argue that
the random forest is based on bootstrap samples and it
misses some influential attributes, because it randomly
selects the attribute and sometimes generates the same
set of logic rules also. As a result, sometimes, it creates
irrelevant information too. To overcome this issue, we
also suggest some other decision forest algorithms such
as SysFor [123] and Forest CERN [51] methods in seizure
detection.

All these findings on seizure detection raise few inter-
esting research questions such as selecting suitable statis-
tical features and machine learning classifiers to take less
computation time as dataset has a high volume with high
dimension, and the most significant missing information
from machine learning classifiers is locating the accurate
point of seizure at the brain lobe(s).

7.1 Class imbalance issue in seizure detection

Class imbalance is one of the serious problems [140] in
machine learning and the majority is seen in medical
datasets [141], particularly in EEG signals. This is because
the duration of EEG recording is long, time-consuming
and seizure duration is for a few seconds, which results
in being prone to errors [91]. As a result, the dataset
becomes highly imbalanced. Previous researchers have
focused on seizure detection. Over the last few years,
researchers have been focusing on the class imbalance
challenge whilst detecting the seizures, and attempting
to solve it by applying different conventional approaches
with some novelties. Javad Birjandtalab et al. [91] used
ANN with a weighted cost function to imbalanced EEG
dataset, by achieving 86% F-measure. El Saadi et al.
[142] obtained 97.3% accuracy using the under-sampling
method with the SVM classifier. In another work by
Saadullah and Awais [143], they used a combination of
SMOTE and RUSTBOST techniques for detecting sei-
zure to imbalance seizure data with 97% accuracy. How-
ever, the research done by Yuan Qi et al. [86] was very
close to the satisfactory result as they assigned the heavy
weights to a minority class of the data to maintain the
effective balance and solved the biasing issue. The main
critique of this work is that the authors did not men-
tioned what weights were assigned and what was their
threshold level? Here, we argue that despite of EEG data
are highly imbalanced as a result of their long-hour EEG
recordings, the recordings continue until the seizure is
detected. The seizure(s) time spans from only seconds to
minute(s). Although researchers [76, 86, 117, 143] made
their efforts in addressing this issue using both ‘black-
box’ and ‘non-black-box’ classifiers, they did not propose
any justifiable solutions, in terms of how big weights
should be assigned to the minority (seizure) classes.

8 Overall observation about capable classifiers
and statistical features

It is challenging to suggest that a specific classifier
should be capable for seizure detection. If we discuss
classifiers, three constraints are very important whilst
selecting a classifier—able to handle the high-dimen-
sional dataset, high accuracy of the model, and able to
retrieve the sensible knowledge. Not all machine learn-
ing classifiers are suitable for seizure detection and
knowledge discovery tasks, mainly because of their
black-box nature. This means that the logic rules/pat-
terns are not visible and understandable to data scien-
tists. In ‘non-black-box’ classifiers amongst decision
trees [53] and decision forests [54], only decision for-
est algorithms are more capable, because the logic rules
and knowledge discovered by a single decision tree are

Page 13 of 18

often limited and insufficient. For example, if we build
a decision tree on a training dataset—it provides a lim-
ited or single set of logic rules and stops growing the
tree further as all the data points in the training set
accept that rule. On the other hand, if we build a deci-
sion forest on the same training set, we get multiple
decision trees with more sensible logic rules. Siddiqui
et al. [104] have done the analysis on CHB-MIT data-
set to know which classifier performs better. For this,
they applied two black-box (SVM and KNN) and two
non-black-box (decision tree and ensemble of trees
i.e., bagging, random subspace, boosting); they found
non-black box classifier (ensemble) outperforms com-
pared to other classifiers of black-box. Even ensemble
also performs better than a single decision tree which
is a non-black box classifier. Siddiqui et al. [63] applied
two decision forests—Systematic Forest (SysFor) and
Forest CERN for quick seizure detection using the con-
cept of epoch length reduction. They achieved 100% of
accuracy. Similarly, Hussein et al. [100] also achieved
100% accuracy using decision forest-random forest
approach.

The literature reveals that in the last few years, ‘non-
black-box’ classifiers, particularly decision forest
approach, were widely used on brain datasets of EEG and
ECoG for different research goals [76, 82, 94, 144]. The
reasons for using the decision forest for seizure detection
are as follows:

1. A decision forest overcomes some of the disadvan-
tages of a decision tree. A decision tree discovers
only a single set of logic rules from an input dataset.
The logic rules that are discovered by a single deci-
sion tree may fail to correctly predict and classify the
class values;

2. A decision forest can produce more set of logic rules/

patterns compared to a single decision tree and there

is a high chance of good prediction/classification
compared to a single decision tree;

Able to handle high-dimensional sets;

4, Due to its ensemble nature a decision forest mostly
produces a high accuracy compared to a single tree
and other classifiers [54];

5. Less computational time (specifically for Random
forest);

6. Logic rules are clear and humanly interpretable such
as analysts/domain experts can easily understand
and suggest best opinions. For example, affected
brain lobe by seizure, identifying suitable statistical
features, etc.

ad

Furthermore, many statistical features have been used for
seizure detection. However, a comparison between them
Siddiqui et al. Brain Inf. (2020) 7:5

is difficult because of their heterogeneous nature. Some
researchers used a single feature such as energy and
entropy. On the other hand, a combination of statistical
features such as energy, kurtosis, line length, entropy,
skewness, max, standard deviation, and min may pro-
duce promising outcomes. Most research [34, 46, 92, 100,
109, 145] have achieved better results using these fea-
tures. The novelty of [29, 63, 104, 125] is the selected nine
statistical features are able to assist in seizure detection
with high accuracy, i.e., 100%. This also provides the clue
about seizure localization with the help of sensible logical
rules. Hence, the selected group of features will not be a
burden to the machine learning classifier but it will assist
in related knowledge discovery.

9 Research directions in seizure detection

In this research analysis, we surveyed different machine
learning classifiers used for seizure detection. No doubt,
the progress of the persistent attempt has been found in
this topic but few interesting research questions are also
raised. In this section, we identify significant challenges
which can uplift the future research in this area.

1. Selecting suitable statistical features and machine
learning classifiers to take less computation time as
the dataset has a high volume with a high dimension.

2. Accurate seizure detection on imbalanced datasets of
long duration EEG recording datasets.

3. Quick seizure detection on long-hour EEG record-
ing.

4, Whilst selecting the machine classifier it should be
kept in mind that the classifier does not miss any
necessary EEG channel/electrode.

5. Knowledge discovery from machine learning classi-
fiers such as seizure localization which exactly points
affected brain lobe(s), channel importance, and based
on participating channels in seizure a knowledge
could be provided to neurologist or neurosurgeon for
suggesting epilepsy category.

10 Conclusion
With the increase of epilepsy, its accurate detection
becomes increasingly important. A major challenge is
to detect seizures correctly from a large volume of data.
Due to the complexity of EEG signals in such datasets,
machine learning classifiers are suitable for accurate sei-
zure detection. Selecting suitable classifiers and features
are, however, crucial.

As such, this paper has comprehensively reviewed
machine learning approaches for seizure  detec-
tion. As a result, we conclude that ‘non-black-box’

Page 14 of 18

classifiers—decision forest (ensemble of decision trees) —
is most effective. This is because it can produce multiple
sensible, explanatory logic rules with high accuracy of
prediction. Further, it can help discover some relevant
information such as seizure localization and exploring
seizure types. On the contrary, ‘black-box’ classifiers can-
not generate logic rules, although they can achieve high
predictive accuracy. As for selecting suitable features, we
should select those that can provide logical results. By
the review of the literature, the use of the features such
as entropy, line length, energy, skewness, kurtosis, and
standard deviation can achieve 100% accuracy in the
classifiers. We suggest not to use the irrelevant features
as the dimension of the data increases. This is because
the computation cost of a classifier will grow high, and
it may also produce insensible patterns. If we use just
one or two features such as line length and energy, the
low-dimensional dataset will be generated. However, this
dataset will not be fruitful for the knowledge discovery
process.

This review paper has provided new perspectives to
data scientists who are working on epileptic seizure
detection using EEG signals. In summary, this paper
focuses on the review of selecting machine learning clas-
sifiers and suitable features.
