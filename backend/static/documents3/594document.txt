Evaluation of stability of swipe gesture ®
authentication across usage scenarios of :
mobile device

Abstract

Background: User interaction with a mobile device predominantly consists of touch motions, otherwise known as
swipe gestures, which are used as a behavioural biometric modality to verify the identity of a user. Literature reveals
promising verification accuracy rates for swipe gesture authentication. Most of the existing studies have considered
constrained environment in their experimental set-up. However, real-life usage of a mobile device consists of several
unconstrained scenarios as well. Thus, our work aims to evaluate the stability of swipe gesture authentication across
various usage scenarios of a mobile device.

Methods: The evaluations were performed using state-of-the-art touch-based classification algorithms—support
vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kKNN) and naive Bayes—to evaluate the robustness of swipe gestures
across device usage scenarios. To simulate real-life behaviour, multiple usage scenarios covering stationary and
dynamic modes are considered for the analysis. Additionally, we focused on analysing the stability of verification
accuracy for time-separated swipes by performing intra-session (acquired on the same day) and inter-session (swipes
acquired a week later) comparisons. Finally, we assessed the consistency of individual features for horizontal and
vertical swipes using a statistical method.

Results: Performance evaluation results indicate impact of body movement and environment (indoor and outdoor)
on the user verification accuracy. The results reveal that for a static user scenario, the average equal error rate is 1%,
and it rises significantly for the scenarios involving any body movement—caused either by user or the environment.
The performance evaluation for time-separated swipes showed better verification accuracy rate for swipes acquired
on the same day compared to swipes separated by a week. Finally, assessment on feature consistency reveal a set of
consistent features such as maximum slope, standard deviation and mean velocity of second half of stroke for both
horizontal and vertical swipes.

Conclusions: The performance evaluation of swipe-based authentication shows variation in verification accuracy
across different device usage scenarios. The obtained results challenge the adoption of swipe-based authentication
on mobile devices. We have suggested ways to further achieve stability through specific template selection strategies.
Additionally, our evaluation has established that at least 6 swipes are needed in enrolment to achieve acceptable
accuracy. Also, our results conclude that features such as maximum slope and standard deviation are the most
consistent features across scenarios.

1 Introduction

Biometric applications on mobile devices, also known as
‘mobile biometrics’, have emerged as a result of consumer
demand for convenient security. The large-scale adoption
of Apple’s TouchID and FaceID demonstrates that users
are willing to adopt alternative authentication method-
ologies to typing a password or entering a PIN. However,
attack models to forge the physiological biometrics such
as face, finger and iris have also developed vigorously
[1-3]. Hence, in order to augment the security,
behavioural biometrics, with secure and robust authen-
tication techniques, are rising as an alternative option.
These are of particular interest in areas such as mobile
banking and payments, and mobile biometrics are
gradually gaining popularity.

Behavioural biometrics make use of the behavioural
traits of a user for authentication. One such mechanism is
to make use of touch-dynamics exhibited by a user on a
mobile device to create a unique behaviour model and use
it for authentication purposes. The user’s touch gestures
on the mobile devices consist of horizontal and vertical
swipes. Touch sensors embedded within the screen can
extract features such as time stamp, touch coordinates
(X-coordinate, Y-coordinate), finger pressure and finger
touch area. These features are utilised to model the user’s
touch behaviour on the touch screen.

Behavioural biometric modalities such as keystroke
dynamics and swipes, are used in the context of contin-
uous authentication [4—6]. Unlike a one-time password
method (PIN, password), continuous authentication tech-
niques non-intrusively verify throughout a session with-
out interrupting the user’s actions on the device. Despite
its promising advantages about convenience, continuous
authentication on mobile devices still has open challenges.
In context of swipe gesture authentication, one of the
key challenges is to ascertain that it can be performed
with high verification accuracy across usage scenarios of a
mobile device. The compactness and portability of mobile
devices provide flexibility for the user to operate them
across diverse scenarios both indoor and outdoor, and,
accordingly therefore, the authentication performance is
expected to stay consistent across these scenarios. Aim-
ing to analyse this factor, our study has been conducted to
evaluate stability of the verification performance of swipe
gestures across different usage scenarios. Due to availabil-
ity of limited datasets with multiple usage scenarios, a
data collection was conducted. In order to simulate real-
life like usage scenarios, the data acquisition sessions were
designed where users were asked to perform the exercise
such as interacting with the phone in constrained (labo-
ratory set-up) and in the wild. The constrained scenario
consisted of the user performing the exercise while seated
on a chair and the unconstrained scenario consisted of
the user performing the tasks while walking outdoors,

while walking at a fixed pace on a treadmill and while
travelling on a bus. The performance evaluations were
conducted using three classification algorithms. Based on
these evaluations, this paper contributes on three areas:

e Evaluation of verification performance using swipe
gestures under different usage scenarios of mobile
device

e Evaluation of time persistence by comparing
intra-session and inter-session verification accuracy

e Evaluation of consistent features across different
usage scenarios

A number of studies have explored touch-dynamics
based behavioural biometrics for continuous authentica-
tion (listed in Table 1). The majority of touch data used
for analysis comprise of data collected in a laboratory
set-up. Frank et al. [6] experimented with authenticating
users based on their raw touchscreen logs. Their experi-
ment involved 41 participants with four different mobile
phone models and collected data across two sessions (sep-
arated by a week). They used support vector machine
(SVM) and k-nearest neighbours (kKNN) classifiers which
achieved “a median equal error rate of 0% for intra ses-
sion authentication and below 4% when the authentication
test was carried out one week after the enrolment phase”.
Although the results reveal promising verification rates,
their experimental protocol for data collection does not
describe the usage scenarios (such as seated or standing)
while undertaking the experiment.

Multiple studies have utilised the touch gestures
acquired from different user interface (UI) elements and
varied application contexts of the mobile device. A study
conducted by Saravanan et al. [8] evaluated different UI
elements such as radio buttons, check boxes and slid-
ers to authenticate a user. Their study consisted of 20
participants and the data collection phase involved the
users to fill digital form on a mobile device using differ-
ent UI elements. Based on SVM classifier, they achieved
an authentication accuracy of 97.9% on mobile devices
and 96.79% on tablets. On the other hand, Feng at al.
[9] utilised a combination of contextual app information
with touch gesture features in their authentication model.
They collected touch gestures such as swipe, click, zoom-
in and zoom-out in an unconstrained environment. Their
model used one nearest neighbour with DTW (dynamic
time warping) classification algorithm and achieved 90%
accuracy in real-life scenarios. Similarly, Wang et al. [10]
utilised the touch gestures generated by real-world app
usage. They analysed users touch gestures along with the
app context for recognition. Their model used SVM clas-
sifier with RBF (radial basis function) kernel and achieved
an AUC (area under the curve) of 80-90%. These studies

captured touch data under variety of app contexts and UI
elements; however, none of them assessed scenario-based
performance variation.

There are limited studies that have considered a variety
of usage scenarios of the mobile device. The experiment
conducted by Bo et al. [7] explored the touch-dynamics
when a user is stationary (static) and in motion (walk-
ing). They intended to capture the tiny perturbation of a
mobile device when a user touches it and utilised those
features for authentication. For the walking scenario, they
reported that after 2 walking steps, the false acceptance
rate (FAR) reduced to 0%, and after 4 walking steps, the
false reject rate (FRR) was 18%. This indicates that walking
has an impact on the verification performance. Addition-
ally, studies such as [8] and [9] also have indicated a
need to further investigate the influence of external con-
texts such as sitting and walking in their future work
section. Based on our observation and assessment of the
referenced studies, we decided to evaluate this factor in
detail.

3 Methodology
This section describes the description of data used for the
experiment, experimental configuration and procedure

followed for performing user verification: pre-processing,
feature extraction, classification, enrolment and verifica-
tion phases.

3.1 Data description

There are a number of publicly available swipe gesture
based datasets—|11—15]. However, none of these datasets
contain swipe data captured under different usage scenar-
ios of a mobile device. For instance, the dataset by [11]
contains 2000 participants; however, for the data collec-
tion phase, they released an app on the Google App store
to be downloaded and used. They did not report on the
usage scenario. Our aim was to evaluate both horizontal
and vertical swipe gestures captured in at least two ses-
sions that were separated by at least a week. The database
of Antal et al. [15] consisted only of horizontal swipes after
session 2, 3 and 4, and [14] had two sessions separated by
at least one day apart; therefore, we could not utilise these
datasets.

For the evaluation, a multi-modal behavioural biomet-
ric dataset [16] consisting of 50 participants was used.
This dataset is not publicly available. This dataset con-
sists of touch data captured across a range of modalities:
swipe gestures, signature (finger and stylus), keystroke,

accelerometer and gyroscope data from a Samsung Galaxy
Note 5 (an Android-based device). The participants (60%
male and 40% female) were familiar with touch screen-
enabled mobile devices. However, in order to avoid bias
for the Android device and iOS device users, the iOS
device users were given extra time before the experiment
to familiarise with the Android device. The experiment
was divided into two sessions separated by a week. An
application in form of a general knowledge quiz was devel-
oped for data collection. The app involved on-screen
image navigation (as shown in Fig. 1), numerical and

alphabetical typing and signature production using finger
and stylus. The context of user interface on the mobile
phone was different for horizontal and vertical swipes.
The experiment designed for obtaining horizontal swipes
was in the form of swiping through images from the
image gallery predominantly generating swipes of direc-
tion right-to-left. For vertical swipes, the user had to scroll
through the application vertically, generating down-to-up
direction swipes. For horizontal swipes, the entire content
of the screen changed with one single swipe, whereas for
vertical swipes, the vertical scrolling property was used

that did not change the entire content of the screen with
one single swipe action. Throughout data collection, the
mobile phone’s orientation was fixed to portrait mode.
Data was collected under two different environments—
indoors and outdoors.

The usage scenarios considered for the experiment were
categorised into static and dynamic (as shown in Fig. 2).
During static scenario, users performed the experiment
while seated on a chair, holding the phone in their hand.
Dynamic scenarios were further classified into three cat-
egories: (a) the user is moving and the environment is
static (walking outdoors), (b) the user is static and the
environment is moving (the user is seated on a bus) and
(c) the user as well as the environment is moving (the
user walking on a treadmill as shown in Fig. 1). During
the experiment, users were also asked to indicate their
previous experience of using the mobile device in simu-
lated scenarios of the experiment. Only 18% of the users
indicated having previous experience with using a mobile
device on a treadmill.

After acquiring the swipe-gesture data, the verification
model was developed. It consisted of pre-processing, fea-
ture extraction and classification phases that are described
in the next sections.

3.2 Pre-processing

The raw touch data generated a list of data points
with parameters: time-stamp, X-coordinate value, Y-
coordinate value, touch action, finger pressure and fin-
ger touch area. Touch action of a swipe consisted of
ACTION_DOWN, ACTION_MOVE and ACTION_UP
(in the same order for every swipe). Pre-processing
was performed separately for the horizontal and vertical
swipes. The pre-processing phase was focused on iden-
tifying outliers in terms of less number of data points
and invalid swipe input. Swipes containing less than three

(2020) 2020:4

Page 5 of 14

data points were discarded. We observed that mostly
the button press generated these short swipes. We also
identified swipes with no ACTION_DOWN but having
the other touch actions, that is, ACTION MOVE and
ACTION_UP. We believe that it is caused due to hardware
limitations. A possible explanation could be that such ver-
tical swipes were performed very fast and close to each
other, thus, leaving no time gap for the sensor to cap-
ture ACTION_DOWN. Such swipes were identified and
removed.

3.3 Feature extraction

For every swipe stroke, a set of 28 features were com-
puted, which are listed in Table 2. The features taken
into consideration for this analysis were global features,
calculated for the entire swipe, such as average veloc-
ity and total stroke time. The features ‘Start X Posi-
tion’ and ‘Start Y Position’ refer to the corresponding
X and Y coordinates of ACTION DOWN action of the
swipe. In similar manner, the X and Y coordinates of
ACTION_UP were assigned as ‘End X’ and ‘End Y’ fea-
tures respectively. A single swipe stroke consisted of mul-
tiple ACTION_MOVEs, the distance travelled from one
ACTION MOVE to the next were calculated for the X
and Y positions as Delta X and Delta Y. ‘Average Delta X
Position’ and Average Delta Y Position’ were calculated by
obtaining the average of the calculated Delta X and Delta
Y. The ‘width’ of the swipe was calculated as the Euclidean
distance from its first touch point (ACTION_DOWN) to
last touch point (ACTION_UP). The slope was calculated
as the change in ‘Y’ position with respect to ‘X’ calculated
for each data point of a swipe. The maximum and mini-
mum slope values obtained from swipe were assigned as
‘maximum slope’ and ‘minimum slope. First and second
derivatives of the distance (Delta X and Delta Y) were
calculated as velocity and acceleration. From these values,

and the second touch data point. Similarly, Jeaving angle’
was calculated as gradient of the second last and the last
data point. The touch finger size was captured at every
touch action point, and average finger size’ was calculated.
These set of global features calculated for every single
swipe were fed into the classifiers as an input.

3.4 Classifiers

Three discriminative classifiers—support vector machine
(SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and naive Bayes—have
been used for the analysis. Python’s Scikit-learn library
has been utilised for implementation. Our decision to
use these three classifiers has been motivated by multi-
ple reasons. Firstly, we aimed at showing the impact of
usage scenarios of a mobile device using the most used
and already proven classifiers. As shown in the literature
(Table 1), SVM classifier has been proven to be widely
effective in multiple studies using swipe-based authenti-
cation ([6, 17, 18]). Secondly, SVM is a powerful classifier
for supervised binary classification problem such as ours,
where the verification model has to accurately classify the
genuine and imposter class. SVM algorithm finds the opti-
mal hyperplane in the N-dimensional feature space that
can distinctly classify the data. Additionally, instead of a
one-class SVM classifier that utilises only positive samples
(which significantly saves space and improves speed), we
used a two-class classifier as it was the most appropriate
for the verification problem such as ours. We also con-
sidered a ‘zero-effort’ attack model where one randomly
chosen user from the database is considered as an attacker.
This attack scenario can be interpreted as an individual

Page 6 of 14

attacker getting hold of a mobile device and trying to gain
access to app services by forging the genuine user sam-
ples. A SVM classifier with a linear kernel has been used
with multiple C (regularisation parameter) values. The C
value is a parameter that controls the trade-off between
the decision boundary and the misclassification rate. In
order to identify the optimal parameters for the classifier,
parameter tuning using a grid search method was per-
formed. This was done using increasing sequences of C
values (0.01, 1, 10, 100, 1000). This parameter tuning was
performed for every user model using the baseline sce-
nario (sitting) as the enrolment samples always belonged
to the ‘Sitting’ scenario. Based on this search, the best
value of C was assigned as 1 for the entire evaluation.
A radial basis function (RBF) kernel was also utilised for
evaluation; however, as the obtained accuracy rates were
not in acceptable range, we did not report it in this arti-
cle. A possible reason for the worse performance could
be that the data is linearly separable and using a RBF
would cause a forced classification of data in the mapped
hyperplane.

The reasons for choosing k-NN classifier are its fast
computation and robustness characteristics. This algo-
rithm is based on the concept that similar features exist in
close proximity. Therefore, every incoming swipe stroke is
first located in the feature space with respect to the train-
ing swipes, and based on the majority of class labels of
the k neighbouring training samples, a class is assigned to
the incoming stroke. In order to select the k value, mul-
tiple runs (minimum of five) with different k values with
randomly selected training and validation sets have been
performed for every user verification model for all sce-
narios. Based on the outcome of this analysis, the final
k value was picked as five as it gave the lowest classi-
fication/estimation error across different validation sets
(depicted in Fig. 3).

The third classifier used was naive Bayes which “assigns
the most likely class to a given example described by its
feature vector” [19]. Naive Bayes was chosen as it is a sim-
ple probabilistic model used for classification purposes.

3.5 Enrolment and verification

During data collection, swipe gestures were collected and
the verification process was performed off-device. We
based our analysis on the hypothesis that there is only one
primary user (owner) of a mobile device; therefore, the
verification process was designed to verify templates of
the primary user.

Regarding the user selection, the user model was
enrolled using horizontal and vertical swipes of one gen-
uine and one imposter user. The imposter user was chosen
from the dataset based on random forgery method. All the
imposter samples belonged to that chosen user. The same
imposter user was used in the verification phase as well.

Regarding the process involved in the enrolment and
verification phase, the genuine as well as imposter user
swipe samples were split with a proportion of 25% as
enrolment samples and 75% as verification samples. From
the enrolment sample set, only a few swipe samples were
randomly chosen for enrolment. To avoid bias, an equal
number of genuine and imposter samples were chosen for
training the user model (for example, if two swipes were
chosen from the genuine class, then two samples from the
imposter class were chosen for enrolment ). The num-
ber of swipe samples chosen for enrolment were different
based on the research question considered for the analysis
(detailed in the subsection enrolment). The swipe samples
used in enrolment were not used in the verification phase.
The description of the enrolment and verification phases
(shown in Fig. 4) is provided below.

e Enrolment Swipe gesture samples acquired from
both classes—the genuine and the imposter—were
enrolled. Horizontal and vertical swipes were
enrolled separately. The enrolment strategy
employed to carry out analysis for each of the
research questions are outlined below.

— Inorder to find an optimum number of
training samples, the model was enrolled with
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 randomly chosen swipe
samples belonging to the genuine and the
imposter user from the baseline scenario
(sitting) from session 1. The results obtained
using a range of enrolment samples are
explained in Section 4.1.

— For intra-session evaluations (comparison
between scenarios within each session), the
user verification model was enrolled with the
swipe gestures captured in the baseline

(2020) 2020:4

Page 7 of 14

scenario (sitting) and was verified against the
swipe samples captured on different scenarios
(such as treadmill and walking). The number
of swipe samples enrolled were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
and 12.

— For inter-session evaluations (between session
1 and session 2), swipe samples acquired in
session 1 were enrolled and verified against
swipe samples from session 2 belonging to the
same usage scenario. The number of swipe
samples enrolled were 2, 4, 6, and 10.

e Verification: For verification, the imposter samples
belonged to the same imposter user used in the
enrolment phase. The number of swipes used in the
verification phase were around 50. All of these swipes
belonged to the pool of 75% swipe samples
earmarked for verification at the beginning.

During the verification process, the incoming swipe
stroke was first classified as a horizontal or a vertical
swipe. Following this, pre-processing and feature
extraction steps were performed. Based on the swipe
category, a user template (horizontal or vertical) was
chosen. In the matching phase, probability similarity
scores were generated by comparing it to the
identified template class. This process was carried out
for swipes from genuine and imposter users. Based
on the generated scores, false acceptance (FAR) and
false rejection rates (FRR) were calculated for
different thresholds. Further, the equal error rate
(EER) for both types of swipes, horizontal and
vertical, were obtained.

4 Results

The performance evaluations were carried out for four
different purposes : (a) to analyse the minimum number
of swipes required in enrolment to accurately verify a user,
(b) to analyse stability of swipe gestures across different
usage scenarios, (c) to analyse stability of swipe verifica-
tion over time and (d) to evaluate stable features across
usage scenarios.

4.1. Analysis of minimum number of swipes required in
enrolment to verify accurately

In order to investigate this factor, the user model was
enrolled with different number of swipe samples during
the enrolment phase, and remaining swipe samples were
used for verification. It was expected that the verification
accuracy would improve with an increase in number of
enrolled swipes.

Figure 5 shows an average EER attained from the
behaviour model of 50 users using different enrolment
samples for horizontal and vertical swipes separately. It
can be observed that with an increase in number of

enrolled swipes, the EER becomes significantly low. The
trend of decrease in EER rate with increased enrolment
samples can be seen across different usage scenarios and
classification algorithms. For example, using the SVM
classifier, with 12 swipes in enrolment, the average EER
attained is 1% for horizontal and 2% for vertical swipes. In
going from four enrolled swipe strokes to six swipe sam-
ples in the enrolment, the EER value drop from 20 to 2%
for the horizontal and 19 to 5% for the vertical swipes. The
inter-session analysis (Fig. 6) also reveal a similar trend of
decrease in EER rate with increased enrolment samples.
According to the results acquired, it can be concluded
that a minimum of 6 swipes are required to attain an
acceptable verification accuracy.

4.2 Performance analysis across different usage scenarios
(intra-session analysis)

The intra-session analysis was performed on swipe ges-
tures captured on the same day but using different usage
scenarios. The results were attained individually for ses-
sions 1 and 2. For this analysis, a number of comparison
strategies with respect to enrolment and verification were
implemented as detailed in Table 3.

For session 1, the user model was trained with swipe
samples captured during the sitting scenario, and the
verification swipe samples were taken from the sitting,
treadmill and walking scenarios (captured on the same
day during session 1). For session 2, the user model was
enrolled with data from the sitting scenario and verified
against the sitting, walking and the bus scenario. The
results of individual comparisons for session 1 and ses-
sion 2 using linear SVM classifier, k- NN and naive Bayes
are given in Table 4. It can be observed that the SVM
algorithm produced lowest EERs, followed by kNN and

naive Bayes algorithms for all the scenarios. It can also be
seen that naive Bayes shows the worst performance with
EERs ranging from 33% and above even for the Sitting
versus Sitting scenario comparison. The important factor
to notice is that using SVM, the static scenario Sitting vs
Sitting (having no body movement) in session 1 showed
an EER of 1% and 2% for horizontal and vertical swipes,
respectively. On the contrary, the EERs obtained for the
dynamic scenarios Sitting vs Treadmill, Sitting vs Walk-
ing (sessions 1 and 2) and Sitting vs Bus rise significantly
up to 23%, 31%, 27% and 30% respectively for horizon-
tal swipes and 28%, 27%, 23% and 26% for the vertical
swipes. A similar trend of increased EERs can be seen
across kKNN and naive Bayes for scenarios involving any
body movement, caused either by users or environmental
factors. The Sitting vs Bus and Sitting vs Walking sce-
narios acquired similar EERs. Using kNN, EERs acquired
for horizontal swipes were 33% and 34%, using SVM, it
was 27% and 30% and using naive Bayes 50% and 44%
for the Sitting vs walking and Sitting vs Bus scenarios
respectively.

Further, in order to verify that above results were not
just a chance occurrence, two-tailed statistical signifi-
cance tests were conducted. The purpose of performing
these tests was to evaluate the hypothesis that acquired
average EERs for static and dynamic scenarios are dif-
ferent. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
were considered for each of these intra-session compar-
isons. The alternative hypothesis chosen was two-sided

In order to perform these significance tests, EERs
obtained for the static (population group WUsitting) and
dynamic scenarios (population group [walking ) were ran-
domly chosen. For a given hypothesis test, ‘a’ denotes
significance level. For these tests, the a value was set as

0.05. A P value was calculated for individual statistical
significance tests performed between different scenarios.
As shown in Table 5, all calculated P values were below
the significance level a; therefore, the null hypothesis was
rejected. These results once again ascertain the hypothesis

that there is a difference in performance of swipe ges-
ture authentication for a static scenario versus dynamic
scenarios.

4.3 Performance analysis for time-separated swipe
gestures (inter-session analysis)

For this analysis, swipe gestures obtained on different
days/sessions (separated by a week) but under the same
usage scenario were compared. The user model was
enrolled with swipe gestures taken from the static sce-
nario of session 1 and verified against the static scenario
of session 2. Similarly, the comparison was made for the
walking scenario. As seen in Fig. 6, with ten swipe samples
in enrolment, an EER of 44% was attained for horizon-
tal swipes and 39% for vertical swipe for static scenario
comparison. On the other hand, an EER of 32% for hori-
zontal swipes and 16% for vertical swipes were attained for
inter-session comparison for dynamic scenario (walking
outdoors). This highlights that the EERs get consider-
ably worse for inter-session comparisons, which raises
questions about the stability of the swipes over time. Con-
sidering that same mobile device was used in both the
sessions, there is merit in further investigating if this vari-
ability in the EERs could be associated with the users’

behaviour. From the data, we note that some users had
large variance in feature set data acquired from session 1
and session 2 compared to others. Therefore, it is possible
that the user behaviour for some users are fairly similar
over time compared to others. This would need further
research with a larger sample size and well defined used
behaviour scenarios to ascertain impact of this factor.

4.4 Evaluation of consistent features across usage
scenarios

We conducted this analysis to investigate how reliable the
extracted features are across different usage scenarios of
a mobile device. High consistency is the most desired
characteristic of any feature. In order to carry out this
analysis, a 28-parameter feature set, as shown in Table 2,
was extracted from the genuine and the imposter (ran-
domly chosen) users. The extracted features were first
normalised for horizontal and vertical swipes and, then,
min-max normalisation method (equation given below)
was applied.

— xX min(X)
~ max(X) — min(X)

Lee et al. [20] defined a simple consistency measure-
ment for a feature using a genuine class and a forgery
class. A modified version of their consistency measure-
ment (equation given below) has been used for calculating
stability of every individual feature from the feature set.
Since the aim of this experiment was to evaluate the con-
sistency measure for a given genuine user across different
scenarios, the forgery class was ignored. Instead, for a
given user, the mean and sample variance acquired from

For a given feature i of a subject a, the distance (d;(a))
of that feature for two usage scenarios was calculated
by applying the above formula, by acquiring the sam-
ple mean(M(4scenariol /scenario2» i)) and sample covariance
(0 (Ascenariol /scenario2» !)) of both the scenarios. If the dis-
tance calculated for feature i was greater than feature j,
that is, dj(a) > d,(a), feature i was considered to be
more consistent. For each user, the feature consistency
distance was calculated for every feature and an average
of the distance for every feature was acquired. Based on
above methodology, the results obtained for consistency
measure for each feature for the horizontal and vertical
swipes are provided in Fig. 7. Features maximum slope,
mean velocity of second half of stroke, standard deviation,
norm Y, peak velocity value, average finger size show more
consistency than other features for all three scenarios—
Sitting vs Treadmill, Sitting vs Walking and Treadmill vs
Walking. These identified consistent features shall be fur-
ther utilised to optimise the verification performance in
the next verification model built using feed forward deep
neural network architecture.

5 Discussion
Unlike traditional biometrics, mobile biometrics provide
flexibility for the users to carry out authentication on
device anywhere and everywhere, thereby also introduc-
ing additional challenges to address. One of the key chal-
lenges is to provide stable authentication across usage sce-
narios. The outcome of performance evaluations across
usage scenarios reveal a significant difference in verifi-
cation accuracy for a stationary scenario (seated on a
chair) and scenarios with body movement. One possi-
ble reason for the variation in verification accuracy could
be the selection of enrolment swipe samples. The enrol-
ment swipes for all evaluations were taken from baseline
scenario (sitting) and were captured under controlled set-
tings. However, the verifications were done on swipe ges-
ture samples that came from uncontrolled data captured
using scenarios with or without body movement. Given
promising verification rate of Sitting vs Sitting scenario,
it is likely that the verification accuracy may improve if
the enrolment and verification samples are always com-
ing from same usage scenario. This suggests that there
is a need to choose appropriate templates for swipes to
improve verification accuracy. A template selection strat-
egy to dynamically choose appropriate enrolment swipe
gestures based on movement and non-movement scenar-
ios needs to be developed. However, such a technique
would mean that the enrolment process would require
user to capture swipes for different scenarios thereby
implying additional efforts from the user. Also, such a
strategy would raise additional concerns such as validity of
the enrolled swipes (do the enrolled swipes need replace-
ment? If so, how frequently the enrolment swipes have to
be replaced) and the extent of usage scenarios that needs
to be defined.

For swipe gesture authentication, evaluating the veri-
fication persistence is another key challenge. The exper-
imental results obtained for intra-session comparison

(performed on the same day) are more acceptable than
inter-session comparisons (performed on different days
of a week). A possible reason could be that the user
behaviour is more stable on the same day compared
to over a whole week. Nonetheless, a significant dif-
ference in the verification performance for inter-session
comparison raises questions about the longevity of this
behavioural feature. Hence, the concept of one time
enrolment’ may have to be investigated for swipe-based
authentication.

Another key aspect of swipe-based authentication is
usability. From this perspective, the idea of attaining
higher accuracy rates based on minimal data is highly
attractive. The results of this analysis show that there is
a need to have at least six swipes in enrolment. How-
ever, a standardised method to qualitatively select these
enrolment swipe samples needs to be established. Con-
sidering that the swipe based authentication is silent and
non-intrusive to the user, there is a need to identify if
the enrolment data would consist of the first few swipes
exhibited by the user or would be qualitatively selected
from a sequence of swipes acquired over a period of time.

As efforts are being taken to use minimum number of
swipes in enrolment, it is extremely important to use the
most stable and discriminant features. As new features for
swipe gesture based authentication are evolving, there is a
growing need to optimise these features in order to have a
positive impact on the verification accuracy. The analysis
to find the consistent features reveals that features such as
maximum slope and standard deviation are stable for both
horizontal and vertical swipes across all usage scenarios,
while number of data points and finger size are consistent
for horizontal swipes, but not for vertical swipes.

One of the limitations of this study is that the analy-
sis has been done on swipe data acquired only in portrait
mode and using one device model (Samsung Galaxy Note
5). It would be interesting to conduct a similar analysis
across multiple devices with different screen sizes which
could highlight further challenges with regards to inter-
operability. Future work would include development of
template update strategies, studying the impact of usage
scenarios across multiple devices and orientation types
(portrait and landscape) while using multiple fingers.

Another noteworthy aspect of study is that the EERs
acquired for the dynamic scenarios using the state-of-the-
art methods are not in an acceptable range to be adopted
as a usable application. However, this work is only a proof-
of-concept that demonstrates the impact of dynamic sce-
narios on the verification accuracy. Based on the results,
we are concluding that the verification performance is
negatively impacted by movement of either the subject or
the environment (compared to static scenarios). Thus, to
achieve an acceptable EER in dynamic scenarios, develop-
ing a multi-modality approach that combines data from

(2020) 2020:4

other sensors on the mobile device, especially considering
the walking scenarios, using the built-in accelerometer
or gyroscope sensors could possibly improve the verifi-
cation accuracy. Additionally, we would like to point out
that these results have been achieved using only 50 users.
Carrying out similar analysis with more data points and
more number of users would further confirm the impact
of usage scenarios on the verification performance.

6 Conclusion

Our analysis aimed at evaluating the swipe gesture
authentication across various usage scenarios of a mobile
device. The evaluation was performed on a _ touch-
dynamics based dataset captured under four scenarios—
the user seated on a chair, the user walking on a treadmill,
the user walking outdoors and the user sitting on a bus.
Three classification algorithms—SVM, kNN and naive
Bayes—were used for the analysis. The intra-session eval-
uation results obtained using linear SVM classifier show
an average EER of 1% for horizontal swipes and 2% for ver-
tical swipes when the enrolment and verification swipes
are from the static scenario (seated on a chair). However,
the average EER for horizontal swipes grew significantly
for other scenarios : 23% (treadmill, session 1), 31% (walk-
ing outdoors, session 1), 27% (walking outdoors, session
2) and 30%(bus, session 2). The rise in EER values for
dynamic scenario were seen across all three classification
algorithms. These results show the extent of impact of the
usage scenarios on the verification accuracy. The results
raise questions about the stability of swipe gesture authen-
tication when used on a mobile device in real-life situa-
tion. Further, the inter-session and intra-session compar-
ison results show that the swipe gestures acquired on the
same day yield better EER compared to those acquired on
different days. This opens up several challenges relating
to time persistence of swipe-based authentication. Addi-
tionally, it is important to build authentication algorithms
using the features that are most consistent across usage
scenarios. Towards this, our analysis revealed that features
such as standard deviation are stable for both horizontal
and vertical swipes. Future work will focus on explor-
ing neural network model such as RNN (recurrent neural
network) to conduct this evaluation and develop meth-
ods to mitigate the influence of the usage scenarios on
the verification performance such as template selection
techniques.
