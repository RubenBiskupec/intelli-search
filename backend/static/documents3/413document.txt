When there are a finite number of options to play at any stage
of a particular game of standard chess played between two
players, a deep-learning algorithm can be easily programmed
to act like a digital machine to predict the set of all next pos-
sible moves by a player. Similar kinds of prediction rules
could also be built for other types of online games played
between two or multiple players. Deep-learning (DL) com-
bined with an artificial intelligence (AI) framework becomes
a powerful tool in several other useful situations in the real-
world [1, 2], and we do not minimize such a potential by
machines in the future.

But predicting and identifying accurately new and un-
known microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, etc., before
they emerge with the help of digital technologies equipped
with DL algorithms or pre-programmed steps seems to be
impossible. This is due to an enormously large number of
species possibilities and also very large bounds of uncer-
tainties for emergence of newer species that are involved.
Naturally we are interested in the meaning and significance

of these ideas in the context of the COVID-19 virus. People
seem to be overly optimistic about the efficacy of DL/AI in
predicting new viruses.

Accurate identification with certainty for the presence of a
known microorganism through a digital machine is only pos-
sible when the information fed into the machine, before it was
employed to identify such a microorganism, is complete.
Besides, there should not exist any possibility of emergence
of new information to identify that microorganism in addition
to the previously noted rules of identification for which a
digital machine was developed.

Digital technologies should use quantification of the data at
a precise level. That facilitates establishing deep mathematical
structures and relations between the data points within an AI
framework. The power of predictability of machines for the
occurrence of events of interest increases (in this case the
event of interest will be ‘predicting the emergence of a new
microorganism’) with the power of the accurate and complete
data that the machine has in its functionality. To feed complete
information into a digital machine is challenging because the
scale of the number of species of the microbe and types of
microbial species on Earth is enormous [3, 4]. As per the 2016
study in [4], the number of microorganisms on the Earth could
be one trillion, and more than 99% of them are still to be
discovered. The number one trillion is a statistical estimate
and not an exact number.

Suppose we consider the estimated number of microbes of
the study [4] or another estimated number from some other yet-
to-be-published study as an accurate estimate and let us assume
that all of them were discovered. Suppose we list all possible
combinations of these microorganisms such that every future
combination has some probability to emerge as a new virus.
Now let us enumerate these single microorganisms and all pos-
sible combinations of microorganisms. Suppose that informa-
tion on these enumerated organisms was fed into a digital ma-
chine for identifying the prevalence or emergence of new vi-
ruses that a human or an animal could contract in the future.

There are some uncertainties in the previously explained
enumeration because it could take thousands of years to dis-
cover all existing microorganisms [5]. That means that, if a
digital machine is equipped with a currently known list of
microbes and such a list is used to match viruses found in
humans and animals, then that would certainly miss new and
undiscovered microbes (viruses). These would have otherwise
been assumed to be enumerated in the above list of all mi-
crobes and their combinations. By this current rate of discov-
ery of microbes any digital machine that exists or is under
development based on current knowledge of microbes can at
most identify existing viruses successfully. Such a possibility
of identification of existing viruses is certain only if complete
information on the past viruses is available and machines were
trained to identify them. We label here such a digital machine
which identifies past discovered viruses successfully but fail-
ure to identify a future undiscovered microorganism as an
incomplete digital machine.

The digital machines we classify broadly here as two types:
(1) a wearable one that identifies the presence or absence of
microorganisms based on causative symptoms and signs, and
(ii) the second type of machines that can be used in blood
culture tests. Wearable technologies are not confirmatory
and those using blood culture are accurate but suffer the in-
completeness of the undiscovered information as explained
above. For the new pandemics live COVID-19 (Novel
Coronavirus Diseases 2019). caused by the novel coronavirus,
those digital machines which use the blood culture tests can
identify accurately only if the complete information on the
microorganism that causes COVID-19 is fed into the machine.
Put in other words, the COVID-19 virus cannot be diagnosed
by blood culture. (Fig. 1).

Of course, there will still be issues like the sensitivity and
specificity of such machines. Wearable digital machines, on

the other hand, are not as accurate as blood culture-based
digital machines because wearable machines use the data of
symptoms and signs to identify associated viruses in the body.

Microorganisms, we believe, occupy much more dominant
positions than they are perceived to have, and they are better
situated than the pace at which digital technology is develop-
ing. Moreover, digital health technologies once built might
generate data dynamically, but the set of data points that it
will predict can never be dynamic. All these quantities have
to be accountable and the probability of predicting depends on
the event of collecting accurate data for a new epidemic. Even
to predict a new epidemic well beforehand with a probability
less than one (i.e. the non-perfect probability to predict an
epidemic), the data to be fed into digital technology is going
to be enormous and mostly not available.

In conclusion, digital health technologies only know
that which is fed into them, but they would never be able
to predict something which was never seen before in ex-
perimental labs. But digital health technologies combined
with AI will certainly help in reducing the time taken in iden-
tifying viruses at the population level if complete information
is available on viruses and in drug discovery trials [6—8].
When outcomes of an experiment are finitely many then deep
learning algorithms have greater roles in assisting in digital
health-related technologies [9]. Although we are skeptical of
the successful role of digital health technology in predicting a
new virus with certainty in a population, such kinds of tech-
nologies are useful in other health care applications; for ex-
ample, see [10, 11].
