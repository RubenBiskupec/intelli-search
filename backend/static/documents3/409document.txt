This study focuses on the formation and detachment of a leading edge vortex (LEV) appearing on an airfoil when
its effective angle of attack is dynamically changed, inducing additional forces and moments on the airfoil.
Experimental measurements of the time-resolved velocity field using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are
complemented by a computational study using an URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes)
framework. In this framework a transition-sensitive Reynolds-stress model of turbulence, proposed by Maduta
et al. (2018), which combines the near-wall Reynolds-Stress model by Jakirlic and Maduta (2015) and a
phenomenological transition model governing the pre-turbulent kinetic energy by Walters and Cokljat (2008), is
employed. Combined pitching and plunging kinematics of the investigated flat plate airfoil enable the effective
inflow angle to be arbitrarily prescribed. A qualitative assessment of flow fields and a quantitative comparison of
LEV characteristics in terms of its center position and circulation as well as an investigation of the mechanism
causing the vortex to stop accumulating circulation revealed close agreement between the experimental and
simulation results. Further considerations of the lift contribution from the pressure and suction side of the airfoil
to the overall lift indicates that the qualitative lift evolution is reproduced even if the pressure side contribution is
neglected. This reveals important characteristics of such airfoil dynamics, which can be exploited in future
experimental studies, where direct aerodynamic force and moment measurements are greatly inhibited by
dominating inertial forces.

 

1. Introduction

Aerodynamic forces and moments induced by the leading edge
vortex (LEV) on airfoils that experience a sudden change in angle of
attack are of relevance for a multitude of applications. The induced lift
during the growth phase of the LEV is exploited by insects to attain
higher lift and is often considered as inspiration for the development of
propulsion concepts for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) (Eldredge and Jones,
2019). However, in other applications the negative pitching moment on
the airfoil during the LEV detachment can endanger the structural
integrity of components, for example rotating helicopter blades or wind
turbine blades.

change of the inflow angle are described by dynamic stall phenomena
(McCroskey, 1982; Carr, 1988; Corke and Thomas, 2015). With an
increasing angle of attack, the flow over the airfoil separates and
recirculates increasingly earlier until the boundary layer at the leading
edge starts to roll up into a LEV. When the angle of attack is further
increased, the vortex grows by accumulating mass and circulation
transferred from the separated leading-edge shear layer. As long as the
vortex is attached to the airfoil, the dynamic lift significantly exceeds the
static lift. Depending on the experimental parameters, flow reversal at
the trailing edge or an eruption of the boundary layer beneath the vortex
leads to vortex detachment (Widmann and Tropea, 2015). Both
detachment mechanisms have in common that secondary structures
grow on the upper airfoil surface ahead of the main vortex and cut off

the LEV from its feeding shear layer. According to Wu et al. (2006), the
dynamic lift is significantly lower than the static lift during and after the
detachment phase of the vortex due to the convection of circulation
away from the airfoil. Additionally, a negative pitching moment is
induced on the airfoil.

The long-term goal of the current project is to increase and prolong
the dynamic lift by delaying the leading-edge vortex detachment with
the aid of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator (Benard
and Moreau, 2014; Kotsonis, 2015; Kriegseis et al., 2016). Future nu-
merical studies are intended to identify topologically effective and
efficient actuation strategies in terms of actuation strength, timing and
location based on a numerical integration of the plasma actuator
developed by Maden et al. (2016). Therefore a common numerical and
experimental baseline case without an actuator is examined in this study
to validate the numerical setup.

However, in the framework of this study — and particularly on the
grounds of a direct comparison of numerical simulations and experi-
mental results — the resulting forces induced on the airfoil will be
investigated. These investigations address and resolve a very common
difficulty encountered with experimental studies of unsteady aero-
dynamic configurations, especially those conducted in air. In such cases
the motion required to achieve a desired reduced frequency, together
with the model mass, lead to inordinately high inertial loads acting on
the motion actuators, dominating any fluctuations of aerodynamic loads
(de Croon et al., 2015), which are those of primary interest. Thus, the
aerodynamic loads are typically completely masked in sensor noise. This
then hinders a direct experimental comparison between the develop-
ment of the velocity field and the aerodynamic forces, especially lift and
pitching moment.

These forces and moments are difficult to measure with alternative
means. Pressure taps on a moving model introduce insurmountable
difficulties in terms of oscillating air columns (Cordes, 2016) and
moreover, add weight to the model, necessitating even more powerful
actuators to achieve a given reduced frequency (Rival and Tropea,
2010).

A further alternative is to deduce forces directly from the measured
velocity field, a technique which has been well-established in recent
years (DeVoria et al., 2014; Noca et al., 1999; Rival and van Oudheus-
den, 2017). However, application of this technique requires not only
dedicated experimental facilities, but is also quite complex. One major
difficulty is that when the velocity field is captured using PIV, both sides
of the moving airfoil must be illuminated, unlike the more common one-
sided illumination, in which only the suction side of the airfoil is
measured and a shadow is cast on the pressure side. Some setups have
been introduced using transparent models, through which a laser light
sheet can pass from the suction to pressure side or refractive index
matching techniques (Budwig, 1994; Rival et al., 2011; Wiederseiner
et al., 2011); however, also this leads to model complication and
fabrication difficulties.

Also techniques exist in which pressure can be obtained from PIV
velocity data, and these do not require information throughout the
entire velocity field, as discussed in van Oudheusden (2013). Such
techniques have been used to determine hydrodynamic forces on
swimming animals, as demonstrated by Dabiri et al. (2014) and Lucas
et al. (2017). They potentially offer a solution to obtain at least the lift
contribution of the upper airfoil side by pressure integration. However,
the lift contribution of the lower airfoil side with conventional PIV
measurements remains elusive and the overall lift is generally under-
estimated by considering only the upper/suction surface.

In the present study a comparison between numerical and experi-
mental results indicates that for the airfoil kinematics investigated, the
lift evolution can be qualitatively very well followed by analysis of the
suction-side velocity field only. While this might appear obvious, the
usefulness of such an approach should not be underestimated, since
acquiring data from both sides of the airfoil complicate the experiment
significantly.

2. Airfoil kinematics

In this study a flat plate airfoil of 120 mm chord and 6 mm thickness
with asymmetric, sharp leading and trailing edges of 30 tip angle, as
shown in Fig. 1, is chosen as a generic flow configuration. The sharp
leading edge geometry produces a fixed shear layer separation position
during the airfoil motion. Rather than cyclic motion, a one-shot down-
stroke with combined pitching and plunging kinematics is investigated.
By adding pitching motion to pure plunging motion, the effective angle
of attack of the inflow on the flat plate a(t) can be arbitrarily pre-
scribed by adding a geometric angle of attack @g.o(t) to the angle of
attack induced by the plunging motion Qpiunge(t). The one-shot kine-
matics has been recently shown to result in the same velocity field as
cyclic motion (Li et al., 2020). The computational study uses the same
geometry and kinematics; accordingly, the effective angle of attack
history was chosen to be quasi-sinusoidal with 30 amplitude to
generate a sinusoidal d.o(t) evolution according to:

2mt

Gere (L) = 30° sin (=) (1)

To investigate a flow configuration representative of biological
propulsion in terms of dimensionless numbers, the chord based Rey-
nolds number Re = U,,c/v built with the free-stream velocity U,,, the
chord of the flat plate c, and the kinematic viscosity v, was set to 24,000.
The reduced frequency k = ac/(U,T), computed using the motion
period of the full cycle T, was set to 0.48, and the Strouhal Number St =
hc/(U..T) =0.1, was computed using the full stroke height h = 0.15 m.
The corresponding evolution of effective and geometric angles of attack
can be seen in Fig. 2.

3. Experimental setup

The experimental investigations were conducted in an open return
wind tunnel at the Technische Universitat Darmstadt, with a test section
of cross-section 450 mm x 450 mm. The free-stream turbulence level in
the test section was measured to be below 0.3% for the investigated free-
stream velocity of U.. = 3.33 m/s. An encoder controlled pitch-plunge
apparatus using magnetically driven shafts was used to move the
airfoil. The airfoil spanned the entire tunnel width to avoid three-
dimensional flow effects. The maximum deviation of acceleration be-
tween the prescribed and measured value was always less than 7% for
the investigated parameter range. In any case, the actually measured
motion was always used in data processing.

The flow field was measured using two-dimensional, two-velocity
component (2D2C), time-resolved particle image velocimetry at an
image pair acquisition frequency of 1000 Hz. A laser light sheet of 2 mm
thickness positioned at a quarter span of the airfoil was produced by a
frequency doubled, dual cavity Nd:YLF laser. A Photron© SA1.1 CMOS
camera with a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels captured the DEHS
seeded flow in a field of view spanning x/c = 1.2 in the flow direction
and x/c = 1.2 in the airfoil plunging direction. DEHS particles of about 1
wm size and a density of 900 kg/m? were generated by blowing

which the aerosol was directed into the settling chamber of the wind
tunnel through a seeding rake. Raw images were correlated using a
multi-pass, multi-grid interrogation scheme with a final interrogation
area (IA) size of 16 x 16 pixels and 50% overlap, providing a resolution
of 1.3 mm/IA and 92 velocity values over the chord of the flat plate. A
median based outlier filter with a threshold of 2 was used to exclude
invalid vectors within a 3 x 3 neighbourhood after the final correlation.
The maximum percentage of excluded velocity vectors was always
below 3%. Excluded vectors were subsequently interpolated from their
respective 3 x 3 neighbourhood.

In order to quantify the leading edge vortex circulation I,py and its
center position (x_zy and y,zy), two scalar fields based on the method
proposed by Graftieaux et al., 2001 were considered. The vortex center
is determined by the maximum of the I; scalar field and the LEV
boundary identified from the I’, scalar fields with a threshold of Tz = 2/
a. For this threshold, only regions of pure shear are attributed to the
vortex domain. To obtain Igy, the vorticity within the detected Iz
boundary was spatially integrated according to Stokes’ theorem. Further
details on the evaluation of different vortex identification procedures
can be found in Kissing et al. (2020). For the investigated parameter set,
10 individual runs were recorded and correlated from which the vortex
quantities were extracted on a phase-averaged basis. For all investigated
vortex quantities the standard deviation of the phase-averaged charac-
teristics was found to be within 4% of the asymptotic standard deviation
computed from 30 runs.

4. Computational method, details

The presently employed RANS model of turbulence represents an
extension of the near-wall Reynolds stress model (RSM) proposed by
Jakirlic and Maduta (2015), which provides enhanced sensitivity to
account for laminar-turbulent transition. This background uu; —a!
model (with w" = e"/k;k = 0.5ujuj;) has been derived from the
homogeneous-dissipation-based RSM (e" = ¢ —vdk/(dx;0x;)) proposed
by Jakirlic and Hanjalic (2002). The modelling approach is based on
blending the relevant source terms in the momentum and Reynolds
stress (uju;) equations with those originating from an appropriately
modified eddy-viscosity based model (EVM) governing the pre-turbulent
kinetic energy k, (Walters and Cokljat, 2008). The resulting model
formulation is designed to predict the onset of the laminar-to-turbulent
transition, rather than explicitly modifying the RSM equations in a term-
by-term manner. The Reynolds stress tensor originating from the tran-
sition EVM (defined via the Boussinesq correlation) changes over to a

International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow 86 (2020) 108726

turbulent one (determined by solving the Reynolds stress equation)
automatically, once the turbulent kinetic energy k exceeds its laminar
(k,) counterpart. The model has been thoroughly validated in numerous
by-pass transition flow configurations in a range of free-stream turbu-
lence intensities (between 0.18% and 6%) subjected to different external
pressure gradients also including cases with separation-induced transi-
tion, see Maduta et al. (2018) for more details. The predictive capabil-
ities of the present transition-sensitive RSM have been furthermore
illustrated in computing both a baseline flow and a plasma-actuated flow
past a plunging NACA 0012 airfoil in Kiitemeier et al. (2019).

The model equations are implemented into the code OpenFOAM®
with which the present simulations are performed. The OpenFOAM®
code represents an open source Computational Fluid Dynamics toolbox
utilizing a cell-center-based finite-volume method on in-general un-
structured numerical grids and employing the solution procedure based
on the PISO procedure for coupling the pressure and velocity fields. The
convective terms are discretized by the 2nd-order central differencing
scheme (CDS) blended by a very low fraction of the upwind scheme (e.
g., the CDS fraction reached up to 97%) implemented in the deferred-
correction manner. Such a discretization scheme combination is
considered adequate in view of a very fine grid used in the regions with
high gradients. The implicit temporal discretization was performed by
the three-times-level scheme. The temporal resolution adopted yields a
Courant number smaller than 1 over the entire solution domain.

The adequately large flow domain, bounded by the upper and lower
wind tunnel walls, accommodating the plunging-pitching plate is
meshed using the OpenFOAM® code and its utility ‘blockMesh’. An
appropriately structured, fully hexahedral grid (Fig. 3) consisting of
100,000 cells in the vertical plane is generated with a grading towards
the plate and wind tunnel walls, providing the wall-next computational
node situated well in the viscous sublayer with the dimensionless wall
distance y* being substantially smaller than one for the entire simula-
tion time. Accordingly, the governing equations are integrated to the
walls applying the boundary conditions based on the exact asymptotic
behavior of the mean flow and turbulence quantities, insuring that the
near-wall regions are fully resolved. The feasibility of a two-dimensional
URANS computational framework has been preliminary checked in
comparison with a three-dimensional one by computing a very relevant
flow configuration coping with a plunging NACA 0012 airfoil by using
the baseline Reynolds stress model in Kiitemeier et al. (2019). The
resulting vortex structure patterns as well as evaluated lift coefficients
exhibit closest mutual agreement. The present experimental observation
supports this behavior detecting no noticeably flow variation over the
plate in the spanwise direction. The grid movement and deformation
occurring during the pitching-plunging down stroke motion, simulating
the experimentally realized movement of the plate, is accounted for by
using the technique based on the radial basis function developed by Bos
et al. (2013). The experimentally measured inflow velocity (U,, = 3.33
m/s) and turbulence intensity (0.3%) are prescribed at the inflow plane
situated at 0.985 m in front of the flat-plate leading edge.

5. Results

Phase-averaged experimental results of the flow field around the flat
plate undergoing combined pitching and plunging downstroke motion
in terms of normalized vorticity wc/U,, are shown in Fig. 4(a), (c), (e)
and (g) for different dimensionless time instants t/T. The inflow is in the
positive x-direction and the airfoil is translated in the negative y-direc-
tion. For t/T = 0.125 the vortex grows close to the leading edge,
attached to the airfoil surface, with the rear flow reattachment point
behind the vortex at about x/c = 0.25. At this early stage the vortex core
consists of concentrated vorticity with a large gradient at its outer
boundary. The normalized vorticity attains values of about —40 within
the vortex core during this phase of the LEV growth. At t/T = 0.25 a
counter-rotating secondary vortex arises on the airfoil surface between
the vortex and the separated shear-layer at the leading edge. The rear

the right column ((b), (d), (f), (h)).

reattachment point behind the vortex reaches the trailing edge at about
t/T = 0.375, where the vortex center has passed half of the airfoils
chord. At this instant the absolute dimensionless peak vorticity value has
decreased to about —30. Subsequently, growing secondary structures
(secondary and tertiary vortices) ahead of the LEV can be observed, that
separate the vortex from its feeding shear layer at t/T = 0.5, where the
vortex center has travelled downstream of the trailing edge.

Fig. 4(b), (d), (f) and (h) illustrates the temporal evolution of the
normalized vorticity field obtained from numerical simulations. At the
first dimensionless time instant, a concentrated vortex core containing
normalized vorticity with values around —40 and the stagnation point of
the flow behind the vortex at about x/c = 0.25 are in close agreement
with the experimental results. The thinner layer of opposite (positive)
signed vorticity below the leading edge vortex on the airfoil surface can
be attributed to the increased spatial resolution of the numerical results.
At t/T = 0.25 pronounced secondary structures ahead of the main vortex
can be observed, in agreement with experimental results at this instant.
The dimensionless time instant at which the rear reattachment point
behind the vortex has travelled downstream of the trailing edge (t/T =
0.375) is, analogously to the experimental flow fields, accompanied by
growing secondary structures that separate the LEV from the leading
edge shear layer at t/T = 0.5. The absolute dimensionless vorticity peak
value at t/T = 0.375 is comparable to experimental results at the same
time instant.

To quantify the agreement between experiments and simulations in
terms of leading-edge vortex characteristics, its circulation I';zy was
obtained from velocity fields using the vortex identification method
proposed by Graftieaux et al. (2001). Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the
time-resolved normalized circulation of the LEV obtained by spatial
integration of the vorticity within the area detected by the lp scalar field
with a threshold of [2 = 2/z. For the experimentally determined cir-
culation evolution, vortex characteristics were extracted independently
from single runs prior to phase averaging. The gray-shaded area in-
dicates the standard deviation from phase averaging in both directions
for the experimental results. The computationally obtained normalized
circulation evolution follows the experimentally obtained circulation
closely up to t/T = 0.2. For later non-dimensional time instants, the
experimentally determined circulation is lower than the computation-
ally obtained one, with an almost constant offset considering the
inherent scatter of the experimental data. Inspection of single frame
experimental vortex identification results reveals that the rapid decrease
in the experimentally obtained circulation evolution at t/T = 0.2 is
caused by the fact that the leading edge shear layer is identified as a
separate region and not attributed to the main identified vortex from t/
T = 0.2 onward. However, the LEV keeps accumulating circulation from

the leading edge shear layer. In the vortex identification results from
numerical flow fields, the leading edge shear layer and the LEV are
identified as connected regions, leading to higher circulation. Based on
this, the deviation of circulation evolution, encountered from t/T = 0.2
onward, can be attributed to the vortex identification approach used.
The peak LEV circulation of both results was detected at about t/T = 0.4
with similar normalized circulation values, indicating good temporal
and quantitative agreement between numerical simulations and exper-
iments regarding the LEV circulation evolution.

It is interesting to note that the peak circulation occurs shortly after
the rear reattachment point of the flow behind the vortex - a half-saddle
bound on the airfoil surface from a topological point of view - has
travelled downstream of the trailing edge as observed in the flow fields.
When this half-saddle convects downstream beyond the trailing edge,
fluid from behind the airfoil can recirculate around the trailing edge and
become entrained below the main vortex. This fluid contributes to an
increased growth of the secondary vortex. The growing secondary vor-
tex in turn can cut off the main LEV from the feeding shear layer, as
observed by Rival et al., 2014 and thus, cause its detachment from the
airfoil. In order to test this detachment hypothesis for the current
experimental parameters, the velocity tangential to the airfoil surface,
averaged over the first three velocity values above the airfoil is shown in
Fig. 6.

The large negative (blue) diagonal areas in both diagrams are caused
by the induced velocity of the clockwise rotating main LEV on the airfoil,
which is against the inflow direction. The white strip of zero velocity
(marked with a green line) behind the LEV trace of negative velocity,
indicates the location on the airfoil where the tangential velocity sign
changes, thus indicating the position of the rear reattachment or half-
saddle of the flow behind the vortex. When the half-saddle convects
downstream of the trailing edge at x/c = 1 (marked with a green arrow
head), the above-mentioned detachment mechanism is initiated. The
experimentally determined trace of the half-saddle reaches the trailing
edge at about t/T = 0.36 as shown in Fig. 6a, while the numerically
obtained half-saddle reaches the trailing edge at about t/T = 0.38. The
time instant from which fluid can recirculate around the trailing edge
occurs just before the corresponding peak LEV circulation is reached.
This temporal sequence of fluid recirculation around the trailing edge
and subsequent stop of circulation accumulation, in combination with
growing secondary vortices, suggest a vortex detachment in accordance
with the observations by Rival et al. (2014) for both investigations.

In order to assess the vortex center convection parallel to the airfoil,
which, according to Wu et al. (2006), also influences the lift force, the
vortex center was computed from the velocity field using the I’; crite-
rion. The center locations were processed for individual experimental
runs prior to phase-averaging. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of numeri-
cally and experimentally obtained vortex center locations, where the

gray-shaded area indicates the standard deviation of experimental phase
averaging. Up to t/T = 0.3 both center locations evolve in close agree-
ment, whereas afterwards an increasing divergence of x,zv up to 17% at
t/T = 0.45 can be observed. Since the vortex was found to detach from
its feeding shear layer due to recirculation of fluid around the trailing
edge from t/T = 0.375 onward, the deviation of its center position oc-
curs at time instants that are no longer in focus for this study or for the
overall project. A potential explanation of the deviation is the sensitivity
of the vortex topology to small deviations early in the downstroke. Up to
t/T = 0.375 the deviation of the LEV center position between experi-
ment and simulation was found to be below 10%, which is considered
acceptable agreement.

Based on the good agreement of numerical simulation and experi-
mental measurements, numerical results are used to compute the lift
contribution of the upper and lower sides of the airfoil to the overall lift.
In Fig. 8, the lift coefficients C,; of the suction and pressure side are
compared with their sum, which is the overall lift force. These coeffi-
cient contributions are obtained by integration of the static surface
pressure p along the airfoil according to:

C = ee fom dl, (2)

where p,, is the fluid density at the outlet, ny the component of the
normal vector of the surface normal to the free stream velocity, and C
the contour around the airfoil section. The integral is implemented as a
summation over the available discrete grid points on the plate surface.

Several features of the curves presented in Fig. 8 are noteworthy. For

one, the force jumps immediately after motion starts, presumably due to
the added mass which must first be accelerated. Thereafter, the force
evolution on the upper/suction side corresponds closely to the total
force, achieving its maximum at about the same time (t/T = 0.204) and
differing in magnitude only be the initial offset value. Only after about t/
T = 0.3 deviations become larger. On the other hand, the pressure side
contributes less to the overall force and peaks somewhat earlier (t/T =
0.168). The pressure side exhibits also a negative lift force near the end

of the motion, accounting for the larger deviation between the upper
side contribution and the overall force. It is however apparent, that the
change of total lift force throughout much of the plate motion follows
very closely the force change on the upper surface, both qualitatively
and (with an offset) quantitatively. The consequence of this observation
is that measurement of the velocity field development only on the upper
side of the plate, should be indicative and correlate well with changes of
forces acting on the plate. The contributions coming from the lower
surface can be qualitatively neglected, thus simplifying greatly the
measurement effort.

To further deepen this insight, the pressure distribution around the
plate has been plotted in Fig. 9 for various phases of the motion cycle.
The pressure coefficient is computed in the customary manner

where p. is the reference pressure obtained at the outlet of the
computational domain and p,, is the corresponding density.

The pressure distribution on the upper side, shown in black, exhibits
a clear minimum corresponding to the LEV. This vortex induces a ve-
locity on the airfoil surface, with a maximum immediately below the
vortex center. This pressure minimum convects towards the trailing
edge in subsequent time instants. This agrees well with the movement of
the LEV shown in Fig. 7.

On the other hand, the pressure distribution on the pressure side
remains almost unchanged at all phases of cycle motion with a linear

and 0.9, where the pressure side edges lead to a contour change. These
edges are also highlighted in Fig. 1 for orientation. The linear character
of the pressure distribution clearly indicates that there are no direct LEV

induced pressure effects on the pressure side of the airfoil for the
investigated parameters. The conclusion drawn from these observations
is concurrent with the remarks associated with Fig. 8, namely that major
changes of forces due to the LEV can be to a large extent associated with
the velocity field development on the upper side of the plate.

6. Concluding remarks

Comparative numerical and experimental investigations of the
leading edge vortex formation and detachment on a pitching and
plunging flat plate have shown that computations successfully capture
the vortex growth and detachment experimentally obtained using time-
resolved particle image velocimetry. Topological flow features in terms
of the LEV size and position, as well as the reattachment point of the flow
behind the vortex on the airfoil surface and the evolution of secondary
structures ahead of the main vortex are in close agreement.

A quantitative assessment of the time resolved LEV circulation and
center position evolution with the aid of the I; and I. scalar fields has
shown that numerical results coincide with experimentally obtained
characteristics up to the detachment of the LEV. The vortex peak cir-
culation value and instant, as well as its center position, could be
reproduced numerically.

The LEV was found to stop accumulating circulation after the rear
reattachment point of the flow behind the vortex has travelled down-
stream of the trailing edge. This suggests that for the investigated
experimental conditions, a recirculation of fluid around the trailing edge
initiates the growth of secondary structures that finally cut off the LEV
from its feeding shear layer, as reported by Rival et al. (2014). This
vortex detachment mechanism is common to both experimental and
numerical investigations.

An investigation of the lift contributions from the pressure and suc-
tion side of the airfoil to the overall lift force evolution shows that the
overall force evolution follows qualitatively closely the suction side
contribution. The pressure side is found to contribute only an absolute
offset value to the overall lift force. Pressure distribution changes on the
suction side of the plate for different phases are found to be dominated
by the LEV while the pressure side distribution is not effected by the
vortex directly. The generality of following qualitative trends of lift
variation based on suction-side flow fields alone has not been shown in
the study, although such a capability would be extremely desirable,
considering the additional effort required to capture the flow field on
both sides of moving airfoils using PIV. With this aim in mind, our
studies continue with other airfoils and kinematics, both experimentally
and numerically.
