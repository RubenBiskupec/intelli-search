Abstract

This paper deals with the current Blockchain adopted in the various types of trading

Korea Maritime and Ocean markets supporting smart contracts that process text-based transaction information
ONensiy Busan 49112, Republic of only when exchanging cryptocurrencies. Even though the Blockchain itself is

orea . . . . . .

Full list of author information is decentralized, services can still be provided through a centralized system in order to
available at the end of the article provide adequate services to the users. It also allows the Autochain to apply

Blockchain technology to existing businesses conducted under the Fourth Industrial
Revolution to realize higher productivity or competitiveness and improve profitability
to a remarkable extent. The Autochain is adaptable to all Blockchain technologies,
companies, or research works around the world to overcome the limitations of the
existing Blockchain technology. It creates the Blockchain-platform ecology chain and
ecosystem, making our lives more convenient while revolutionizing every industry. In
addition, it automates all Blockchain-based systems and offers a base for
constructing a system wherein everyone can easily provide, operate, and maintain
Blockchain services. This paper discusses a number of Blockchain-related
technologies and presents a decentralized Application (dApp) exclusively designed
for mobile use, taking house rental service as an example. It also presents the
existing Blockchain and the Blockchain database storage method and proposes the
dApp based on it.

1 Introduction

Blockchain technology ensures security and transparency by improving existing methods
of providing information in a centralized system to connect and share blocks that make
up the trading distribution nodes of distributed P2P (Peer-to-Peer) networks [1].

The dApp/Autochain platform presented in this paper is a fourth-generation Block-
chain, with many companies now issuing digital encryption in legitimate currencies
through financial markets. Using different names, these currencies have their respect-
ive market values, and some of which are successfully creating new capital markets
and growing steadily.

For this and other reasons, many global IT (information technology) companies are
conducting research and development on cryptographic exchange services that are tech-
nically and economically feasible and investing heavily in Blockchain technology as one of
the core technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. The efficiency of Blockchain
technology has already been proven; according to the Santander report, bank infrastruc-
ture costs could be reduced by up to $20 billion by 2022. Blockchain technology is said to
have reached the third generation as it has become the center of attention in the digital
encryption market in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Recently, EOS announced
that their mainnet actually adopted the third-generation Blockchain technology.

Although 1G ~ 3G Blockchain technologies are all composed of independent main-
nets, certain problems remain unresolved. For example, at present, information or data
generated by each Blockchain cannot be exchanged with another Blockchain as men-
tioned earlier, and some immediate problems should be addressed to ensure a safer
and more efficient exchange of data between the Blockchain platforms. If the technol-
ogy to solve this problem is made available, it will be able to solidify its position as the
most important technology for the development of Blockchain technology in the future.
Therefore, this paper discusses the need for existing Blockchain technologies.

As discussed in this paper, the architecture of this Blockchain is making great efforts
to shift the paradigm of the existing financial system from centralized to P2P. This ex-
plains why the architecture of the Blockchain has become important. Therefore, this
paper presents an architecture that uses distributed storage structures by selecting a
new XML (Extensible Markup Language)-style architected archival method in the
Blockchain in the DBMS (DataBase Management System) and storing it in a cloud ser-
ver, or FOG computing, which are also some of the reasons such Blockchain services
are not applied. It also presents a prototype leaf by applying it to the real estate man-
agement system using this architecture. So far, there is clearly an authorized broker for
real estate sales. Instead of doing this escrow, however, we are incurring a lot of fees.
Overcoming these centralized, validated systems, we propose a new Blockchain archi-
tecture, which is the P2P approach for the management of real estate management sys-
tems. In the future, Blockchain will be used in many areas. It will also adopt a more
convenient method of verifying the deep running of artificial intelligence for these
Blockchain services, and this paper proposes the combination of the vast data process-
ing of big data and Blockchain engines.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology, Sec-
tion 3 discusses the existing research and analysis, Section 4 presents the design and im-
plementation, Section 5 implements the dApp/Autochain applied to real estate, Section 6
shows the Performance Evaluation of Autochain platform of Blockchain, Section 7 pre-
sents the result, Section 8 presents the discussion, and Section 9 presents the conclusions.

2 Methods

The methodology in this paper involves a number of technologies and architectures to
compare the existing Blockchain with the proposed Blockchain. It presents a method-
ology for the process of storing and verifying Blockchain using technologies such as
Blockchain’s DBMS methodology, HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language 5) technol-
ogy, and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) language, XML architecture, Https proto-
col, TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, and UDP

(User Datagram Protocol) protocol. It uses the virtualization technology of distributed
DBMS to store the required database and also utilizes Big Data to analyze and validate
many unverified data using the existing R programs and Blockchain engines. It also dis-
cusses some of the key technologies associated with Blockchain and introduces a
Blockchain-based dApp (decentralized applications) for housing rental services available
on mobile devices. In addition, it uses automation technology that automatically shows
data verification using machine learning and deep learning of artificial intelligence sys-
tems. The languages used here are Java, XML, Python, and JSON, developed using Java
Virtual Machine (JVM), Geoblus Virtual Machine (GVM), and middleware programs.
The database was also stored in the cloud using RDB (relational database).

Thus, this study adopted a software methodology using an agile methodology and
which was developed especially by security coding. This paper also suggests ethically
agreed-upon methodologies that improve the problems of the existing Blockchain-
based research methodologies and presents new theories. Using ERD (entity-relation-
ship diagram) and data flow diagram using the design pattern, various database flows
are shown. Using these Blockchain engines, a “Blockchain real estate transaction”
dubbed dApp/Autochain is presented, including a methodology for acting as an adapter
for application to these various applications.

3 Related research

The Blockchain appeared in the New York Times in 2013 along with Beck Coin, which
was also named “Word of the year” by Oxford Dictionary. Bitcoin started with Bitcoin (A
Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System) published by Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008.
Since January 2009 [2], it has been used as an online virtual currency that freely trades be-
tween nodes via P2P without an intermediary. This security technology is designed to
store and use safely electronic money called “bitcoin” using Blockchain technology. The
Blockchain is also called a public transaction book. It is a technology that prevents double
payment, which can occur in financial transactions, and cannot be tampered with. It has
become a core technology of Pintech in Korea [3, 4]. The bitcoin is the tip of the iceberg,
an application example of a Blockchain application. Still, the public has been underesti-
mating the Blockchain by concentrating only on “the tip of the iceberg.”

Nowadays, however, we are paying attention to the possibility of expanding the
Blockchain as the underlying platform technology. Unlike the local business, which is
still in the early stages of business integration, overseas business is a new business plat-
form that combines technologies such as ICT (Information and Communication Tech-
nology) and IoT (Internet of Things). Nonetheless, current passwords have difficulties
linking them to real-life situations.

3.1 Blockchain

The Blockchain technically enables the replacement of the current centralized ledger
structure with the Distributed Ledger by using the public key algorithm and hash encryp-
tion technique and incurs low cost thanks to the distributed processing structure. Block-
chain technology is regarded as the best payment system because it allows P2P financial
transactions between two parties without the involvement of a 3rd party (financial com-
pany or trusted third party) as long as an Internet connection is available. The Blockchain
Kim and Huh EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:47 Page 4 of 23

offers a more secure means of transaction, and it is commonly used for virtual money
(Bitcoin) [5-9]. In a bitcoin system, the Blockchain plays the role of a distributed digital
book that stores the history of changes in values of the bitcoins, announcing them period-
ically. This book adopts a cryptographic technique to avoid any falsification and keeps a
record of transactions and ownership of bitcoins starting from the first block (Genesis
Block) [10, 11]. The Blockchain containing all previous transaction information shares the
same information with other nodes in the chain. Each distributed database created by
Blockchain technology has a fundamentally different digital backbone as the most distinct
feature of Blockchain technology [12].

For example, Wikipedia’s “master copy’ is edited on a server, and all users are able to
check the new version. In the case of a Blockchain, every node in the network shares
the same information and updates it independently, but the most popular content be-
comes the de facto official record replacing the original master copy [13, 14]. Trust is a
risk judgment between different parties; in a digital world, determining the level of trust
means proving the true identity (authentication) together with a validated permit
(authorization) for questions such as “Are you who you say you are?” and “Should you
be able to do what you are trying to do?” In Blockchain technology, private key crypt-
ography provides a powerful ownership tool that fulfills the authentication require-
ments. Possession of a private key is essential in proving ownership. It also spares a
person from having to share more personal information than he/she is required in a
transaction process, protecting him/her from hackers. Authentication by itself is not
enough to protect transaction information, so the authorization process requires a dis-
tributed peer-to-peer network [15, 16]. The distributed network reduces the risk of
centralized corruption or failure, and it must also adhere to the transaction network’s
recordkeeping and security policies. Approving transactions can only be finalized after
the entire network has applied the rules upon which it was designed (Blockchain’s
protocol). Authentication and authorization methods allow the digital world to carry
out transactions without relying heavily on other expensive or complicated means of
earning trust. Today, entrepreneurs in various industries around the world are recog-
nizing the value of Blockchain technology in the digital world, and they have started to
understand that some type of a new and powerful digital information exchange system
can be created with it [17].

Blockchain technology is often described as the backbone for a transaction layer in
the Internet network, creating the foundation for the future Internet of Value. In fact,
the idea that cryptographic keys and shared ledgers can incentivize users to secure and
formalize digital relationships has made it possible to seek a more convenient but se-
cure system [18, 19]. Everyone, from governments to IT firms to banks, is seeking to
build this transaction layer [20-23]. The authentication and authorization processes in

a Blockchain-based digital transaction are shown in (Fig. 1) [24, 25].

3.2 Application model: autochain
At present, Blockchain is available on various platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum,
Hyperledger, and EOS, and it serves a unique purpose [26, 27].

Aside from its limited processing or authentication speed, however, the public-
oriented Blockchain has several technological limitations [28-30]. First, it is difficult to

process unstructured data such as images, voice, or videos. Second, there is no data

standard for the exchange between Blockchains. Third, both critical and personal infor-
mation are exposed to other Blockchains. Fourth, data exists only in a smart contract,
but there is no user-friendly UI (user interface) [31, 32].

The dApp/Autochain can resolve these problems to provide a variety of services.
First, the Autochain can handle all MP3, photo, and video data as well as Text, DB, and
SMS (short message service) data in a Blockchain. In fact, it can handle all structured
and unstructured data to provide them for a Blockchain service. The Autochain is suit-
able for data exchange as the XML is irrelevant to a specific OS (operating system) or a
software supplier. In other words, the XML operates independently of the platform
used such that it is quite useful in achieving interoperability between different Block-
chain platforms and OS’s. It provides a service that enables the Autochain HUB module
to exchange data between different types of Blockchains.

Second, in each node in the Blockchain, some specific data such as sensitive personal
data will be encrypted to ensure the anonymity and security of the Blockchain [33].

Third, every smart contract in an Autochain provides a Ul-type view for the data and
involves users on the browser, like a single offline document shown in Fig. 2.

The smart contract is composed of XML data, and the document format adopts XSL
(eXtensible Stylesheet Language) so that a dApp can be used to prepare a smart con-
tract. These XML and XSL are used to create a smart contract on the browser by using
the XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) embedded in the standard
browsers. The results can be checked on the browser, and the existing Blockchain is
used only in the cryptographic exchange. This paper attempts to address these
shortcomings.

4 Design and implementation of autochain platform of Blockchain
4.1 Issue raising
One of the common philosophies and perspectives on the Autochain is that it is a form
of Blockchain that “experts in the field should be able to create and use easily.” Cur-
rently, Blockchain-based smart contracts are being created by professional program-
mers who make modifications and changes at a high cost. For this kind of task, it is not
easy to extract data from databases, and HTML is prepared manually to complete a
Blockchain, thus requiring much time, human resources, and expenses. To resolve this
issue, the Autochain allows a general user who does not have sufficient skills in coding
for utilizing the automation tools provided by the Autochain platform to create Block-
chains in a short time. First, by using the smart contract generation tool, the user can
prepare a webform and the details of the contract, and then connect the Hybrid plat-
form engine in the cloud with the Blockchain platform to prepare a fully automated
smart contract. Since the Autochain creates the smart contract by using the Hybrid
Platform’s automation engine, it can be implemented as a distributed system in the
form of “XML (Data)” + “XSL (View),” which is optimized for the distribution node in
the Blockchain. In addition, by using automated technology, it is possible to prepare a
smart contract in a shorter time with less effort to provide an inexpensive yet highly ef-
ficient service. The Autochain assists users at their individual industrial sites, rather
than developers, to create a smart contract automatically and transmit it rapidly
through SNS (Social Networking Service) so that the recipients can use the browsers
embedded in various types of devices to check the contract immediately. Every Block-
chain in the Autochain (a smart contract) can be used conveniently by general users as
if they were using an email system. Due to such technological advantage, the Autochain
platform is clearly different from the other Blockchain platforms in terms of costs, hu-
man resources, and time consumed |[Fig. 3].

a central DBMS and sequentially stored from DB 1 to DB 2 in the end as DB 6. This
method has a distributed storage structure of Blockchain but refers to the same method

as using a central DBMS with a distributed structure. This is a problem with the exist-
ing DBMS architecture.

The Autochain engine can create a Blockchain automatically because it utilizes a data
interworking technology such as EAI/ESB (Enterprise Application Integratio/Enterprise
Service Bus) (Fig. 4).

In Fig. 4, traditional Blockchain data is stored centrally, forcing the use of traditional
centralized DBMS to store them. Nonetheless, the proposed method suggests storing
XML data in an IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)-style file system to deliver it. The ad-
vantage of this approach is that the XML chooses to store XSL and View data separ-
ately, which is a very simple and light delivery method that stores and communicates
View values in address values. Therefore, we suggest an architecture that stores and de-

livers it a la Autochain. View 1 takes View 1, and View 2 takes View 2.

4.2 Autochain architecture

4.2.1 Autochain architecture model

The Autochain platform is a platform that can express both structured and unstruc-
tured data in a Blockchain by using the Autochain Hybrid Platform. Unlike existing
Blockchain data models, it does not use RDB but combines “XML” and “XSL” in the
distribution node to provide a Ul-based view on a built-in browser of the user’s device.
The following shows a comparison of the existing Blockchain data (Fig. 5).

To facilitate the standard application of all data serviced to the Blockchain regardless
of OS type and support the multi-devices of users, the XML created with Hybrid Plat-
form can be converted into various formats. For example, it is possible to convert a Hy-
brid Platform-based PDF directly into Solidity, JAVA, Python, or SQL (Structured
Query Language), etc. The Hybrid Platform is used by general users to create an XML

document with a view function and save it in a Blockchain. The Hybrid Platform meth-

odology first involves the creation of an XML document with a view function (N-D
document), which is saved in a 2-D DB (DataBase).

4.2.2 Blockchain over HTTP

The Autochain-based Blockchain technology is used to create and save a smart
contract having a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard XML database
on an HTTP web. Since the W3C standard data format is used, it can support
every development language and various types of Blockchain services. It creates the
W3C standard XML-based smart contract on the HTTP (HyperText Transfer
Protocol) protocol (Fig. 6) including a view to save it in the Blockchain. The Auto-
chain Blockchain is connected to the Blockchain platform such as Ethereum,
Hyperledger, EOS, Qtum, and Cardano on HTTP to provide Blockchain services. It
is also connected to IPFS or to the distribution DB via HTTP to provide service
on a single Blockchain. Thus, the Autochain implements and provides the “Block-

chain as a Service” on HTTP.

4.2.3 Autochain mainnet
The data currently generated in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is far too diverse in
terms of type, size, complexity, and degree of importance, making search and analysis
of the data’s relevance and real-time processing essential. Blockchain 4.0 (Autochain)
can save all of the data from every field in the Blockchain, and it can be linked to the
legacy system currently being used in most industrial fields. The Autochain can process
the following data types in a Blockchain: structured data (data saved to fit the schema
type saved in RDB), unstructured data having inconsistent structure and irregular forms
(Fig. 7), and geographical data, real-time data, time series data, natural language data,
event data, network data, linked data, etc.

This way, the Autochain can save and service all of the data in a Blockchain and sub-

sequently overcome the limitations of the existing Blockchain platform. It provides the
Hybrid Platform-based Autochain platform, which supports the W3C standards. The

Autochain is a platform that supports its own Blockchain and token ecology like the

mainnet and is expected to support various coin ecologies and eco partners.

4.2.4 Autochain hub chain

Each Blockchain platform implements its own dApp ecology. While it is possible for
each of the Blockchain platforms to exchange data within a single platform, however, it
is impossible to exchange data with other Blockchain platforms since the required data
standardization or protocol standardization is not available. Moreover, the logic to be
implemented in the Blockchain has to be developed and applied by using the program
language inside the built-in VM (virtual machine) of each Blockchain but has limita-
tions in terms of the language supported by VM, and it is harder to correct or supple-
ment it. When the content of every smart contract is uploaded to VM, its size
inevitably increases, causing problems with the processing and transmission speeds.
The existing Blockchain VM fully executes the functions to save and share the Block-
chains as the most fundamental functions, including the logics through AVM. By using
the APIs (Application Programming Interface) provided by various Blockchain plat-
forms, it is possible to integrate the transaction data and linked data provided in each
dApp. The W3C standard XML is supported in the Hybrid Platform mounted inside
the Autochain platform. Although the existing dApp can be applied to each Blockchain
platform, the Autochain platform dApp does not pertain to every Blockchain platform
but provides the dApp service in the upper-ranked BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) in-
stead (Fig. 8).

4.2.5 Autochain framework

The Autochain’s framework is available as a single integrated architecture based on
Blockchain technology, and it can provide an end-to-end service from the time of initial
data generation to the time of the final service (Fig. 9).

In layer 1, it implements the foundation of the Blockchain, BaaS (Blockchain as a Ser-
vice), in order to provide every service in a Blockchain.

In layer 2, the W3C standard XML is used to standardize the data format and sup-
port the XML-Standard in diverse industries and the repository supporting SQL &
NoSQI DB simultaneously.

In layer 3, a middleware layer, the following functions are performed: Data Manage-

ment Processing, Web Service, EAI, Configuration, APIs, Query Processing, etc.

4.3 Blockchain-based process for house rental

The current process of rental agreements for apartments in In the World is very time-
consuming and document-intensive. The process starts once the tenant is selected and
the rental terms for an apartment are agreed upon. Most of the time, the property
management company enters the data manually into their system, creates a standard
rental agreement, and then sends it in duplicate form via regular mail to the tenant.
Together with the rental agreement, the following documents are sent to the tenant:

a) Rental guarantee agreement to open an escrow account
b) In some cantons, the official form containing the initial rent—statutory rent form
c) Form to fill out how exactly the name should be inscribed at the door

d) Form on how rent will be paid: direct debit, payment slip, or standing order

Once all the forms are filled out, and the tenant has signed the contract, all docu-
ments are sent back by regular mail to the property management company, and the
contract is countersigned and sent back to the tenant. Additionally, the property man-
agement company has to give notice to the property caretaker, the power station, and
the residents’ registration office that a new tenant is about to move in to the property.
Once these steps are complete, the property management company needs to receive
confirmation that the deposit has been placed in an escrow account. Only after that
can the apartment be handed over.

To summarize, when a rental agreement is created, it is sent back and forth three
times before it is signed by both parties and archived. The payment of the deposit again
Kim and Huh EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:47 Page 12 of 23

takes a few days until it has gone through. Even if everything is done error-free, this
process may still require at least 1 week for completion. Given the large number of
contractual steps involved, this process may be rendered more efficient using a Block-
chain solution (Fig. 10).

After the terms are agreed upon, the Blockchain generates a rental agreement
and includes the required documents such as the statutory rent form. The form
for the payment terms and the agreement for the rental guarantee for the bank are
obsolete, as payments can be triggered using smart contracts. The tenant can check
and approve the documents and terms of the rental agreements and fill out the
doorbell inscription form. Once done, a smart contract triggers the payment of the
deposit amount to the property management company’s wallet. As the property
management company has already given consent by choosing that specific tenant,
counter-approval is not necessary and can be triggered by the system. The rental
unit including the new tenant is automatically activated in the system. The Block-
chain will trigger notices to the power station, the resident’s registration office, and
the property caretaker about the new tenant. Since the deposit amount has been
automatically transferred, and all other necessary steps are also taken, the accept-
ance report can be filled out, and the key for the apartment can be handed over.

The legal validity of the contract, although only approved online, is given, as a rental
agreement in In the World falls under Art. 11 of the Swiss Code of Obligation stating
that it need not be in a certain form, ie., written form, to be valid—a simple handshake
is enough. Although not necessary, the rental agreement is mostly in written form at
present as the contract serves as proof in case of disputes. Still, approving the terms on-
line should be enough proof in case of dispute.

Fig. 10 Overview of the current process
Kim and Huh EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:47 Page 13 of 23

This process will require the Blockchain to be permissioned, probably with a consor-
tium solution, having the tenants and the property management company as users. Ac-
cess could be granted to the property owners as well. The identities of the users need
to be known, as property management companies will need to know the identity of the
person approving the contract.

The different users should have different roles and corresponding access levels. In In
the World, every building, every apartment has an official identification number. For a
building, the unique number EGID refers to important data of the building including
address, coordinates, year of construction, and number of floors as well as what type of
heating system the building has.

For apartments, this unique identification number EWID refers to the number of
rooms and size of an apartment. Every person registered in the official register for resi-
dents needs to be linked to a unique building identification number as well as to a
unique apartment identification number. This data is already available, and EWID
could be used and linked to the Blockchain application in order to be able to identify
clearly which apartment a person is renting. A person entering a new tenant on the dis-
tributed ledger simply needs to choose the unique identification number of the apart-
ment and add the tenant.

Consensus mechanisms such as voting or multi-party consensus are the ones making
the most sense, also due to the fact that they use considerably less computing power
and enable faster transactions. Triggering rental payments via smart contracts will re-
quire offering a cryptocurrency.

Having this process on a Blockchain will dramatically reduce the time required for a
rental agreement to become valid due to the permissioned setting and the pre-defined
nodes participating in validating the transaction.

The fact that the proposed use case can be called a Blockchain is controversial as
many features of an open-source, public, and fully decentralized Blockchain will not be
realized (Fig. 11).

5 Verification of actual application model: house rental dApp image
application

The Blockchain can assist individuals in drawing up a (smart) contract for the real es-
tate online directly without involving an agent. The landlord can use the House Rental
dApp to list his/her properties on the Internet and discuss the creation of a smart con-
tract with potential tenants. When a tenant signs a created smart contract, it becomes
legal; following the contract terms, the tenant should wire the deposit (encrypted
money) to complete the deal. Immediately after the final payment, the smart contract is
saved in the Blockchain (Fig. 12).

The UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram described in Fig. 13 authenticates
the user with his/her name (or other designations) used in the subscription stage when
he/she logs in, and then moves to the main screen of the app. Based on the ID value,

Figure 14 shows the UML diagram of House Rental Autochain/dApp Image Applica-

tion process. In the UML diagram, MainIndex Header in Class Diagram defines its hash
value as a 256-bit value and sets the time and other elements. Likewise, the SubIndex
Hash value is represented with a 256-bit value for phaseBlock, etc., whereas the header
value is set by using the ClockIndex value. Next, Hblock sets the header and stream
value before sending it to MainIndex Header.

The following is a sample scenario: David wants to put his house up for rent but has
no money to hire a solicitor to prepare a contract, so he enters the Autochain platform

and purchases a monthly rental contract. After that, he puts his house information on

the Autochain platform. On the other hand, John is looking for a house with his wife
and finds the house information posted by David. He likes the house but feels that it is
a bit too expensive and sends David a message requesting him to bring down the rental
to 1000 USD. David checks the message and notifies John of his willingness to lower
the rent. David makes a new monthly rental contract and sends it back to John with his
signature. Then, John receives it, checks the details, and signs it. Once the contract has
been established, John wires the deposit to David to complete the contract according to
the prescribed conditions. Since all the steps are carried out through the XML contract
with a view on the HTTP protocol, it is now possible to conclude the contract in real

time and use the Blockchain service to sign a P2P contract.

6.1.1 Performance of artificial intelligence auto Blockchain

Key factors that determine GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) performance are hardware
parts and internal network components. GPGPU-SIM considers this, consisting primar-
ily of part of a system simulator running a benchmark program based on hardware
components and part of a network simulator connecting each core within the GPU.

6.2 Blockchain performance statistical analysis
This study used the test net basically to do house rental first. K-means clustering ana-
lysis using web metrics shows that the number of nodes is 50, 100, 150, and 200, and
traffic indicators can be viewed. The relationship of TPS (transaction per second) met-
rics can be checked in the desired form by selecting the number of clusters (Fig. 15).

In addition to the functions provided by the solution, the data can be retrieved
through API link and statistical analysis, and the Shiny package of R can be used to
check clusters in TPS using dynamic dashboards (Fig. 16.

6.3 Blockchain performance node analysis

Also, Fig. 17 above shows the performance value of 1200 TPS and the maximum value
of 2000 TPS as a result of 10 simulations of the existing platform. On the other hand,
as in Fig. 18, the Autochain platform showed a performance difference of approxi-
mately 1.5 times with an average value of about 2000 TPS and a maximum value of
3000 TPS.

7 Result

The current Blockchain-related technologies are not yet perfect as they are not fully

used in real-life situations. In fact, most of the current Blockchain technologies are
linked to cryptography for transaction purposes. As these technologies continue to de-
velop, the number of Blockchain platforms will increase continuously, and they will be
used in our daily lives in the near future under the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Such
expectation can only become a reality if we can resolve the issues pertaining to data in-
tegration and service provision between Blockchain platforms, which are also the major
limitations in the current Blockchain industry. Autochain could resolve all of these
problems and ultimately provide an ecosystem where all the Blockchain platforms act
as a single platform. With the growing diversification of Blockchain-related research,
the role of the Autochain platform will be emphasized increasingly and extended. The
Autochain platform will then secure its position as the key global Blockchain platform,
as verifiable and transparent as numerous governments, individuals, and organizations
around the world, including the UN (United Nations), require it to be. Blockchain tech-
nology has the potential to revolutionize trust models and business processes in many

industries. Nonetheless, this technology is still in its infancy, and the distributed

language technology used for Blockchain technology has not been properly monitored

or tested. Despite the positive potential, ClOs (Chief Information Officer) and business
leaders are required to consider a variety of risk factors such as software bugs that
could occur when introducing Blockchain technology or risks associated with quantum
computing technology, for example.

Experts and analysts point out that Blockchain technology may not be appropriate
for some business processes. For example, Barrasula, the founder of Ethereum ex-
change station Leveri, was skeptical about the availability of a Blockchain in the
encrypted money sector. He argues that Blockchain technology is unnecessarily expen-
sive, taking longer time to deploy than the traditional transaction technologies includ-
ing some of the current centralized relational databases. In order for a new block to be

added to the Blockchain, a procedure that checks the encryption of all the blocks is

required. This means that it is not efficient enough to be applied to business areas
where fast transactions are essential.

We will compare the existing platform (Table 1) with the Autochain platform by cre-
ating a comparison table. We can see that the Autochain platform is better than the
existing platform.

Another argument is that the block insert must be serialized because the Blockchain
is literally a “chain” type. Because of this, the update rate is slower than the traditional
parallel database update method. Forrester Research also focused on the frenzy sur-
rounding the Blockchain and the current state of the technology and remarked that the
expectations are too high for Blockchain technology that even many experts do not
fully understand. Meanwhile, Forrester’s chief analyst Martha Bennett predicts that the
proliferation of Blockchain technology will continue to be on a slow and steady pace
and that it will be much more likely used in niche markets than in large companies.
Today, Blockchain technology is mainly used for creating distributed currencies in the
encrypted currency market or virtual finance transactions. Even the most well-known
Blockchain platforms, Hyperledger and Ethereum, are still in their infancy, so the intro-
duction of this technology can give rise to unexpected problems.

Blockchain may not be suitable for data storage in some cases. The biggest advantage
of Blockchain technology is that data can be shared with many by a single data gener-
ation. It is easy to introduce to different nodes on the web, but it is impossible to ma-
nipulate each record because it has its own hash. Thus, distributed ledgers through a
Blockchain-based network can leave much richer, more comprehensive transaction re-
cords than internal systems and blacklist-based selective records. On the other hand,
the transaction data need not be part of a Blockchain. For example, if a Blockchain user
attaches an image as part of a transaction record, the data capacity will surge; as the
data capacity grows in a situation where time-consuming, one-sided addition is pos-
sible, this will lead to network overhead. In this case, due to the nature of the Block-
chain that distributes the data, all the data must be replicated to all nodes in the chain.
As such, for some transactions, it is better to use a relational database running on sep-
arate network storage rather than a Blockchain that is difficult to control. There are
two main types of Blockchains: public Blockchain and private Blockchain. Public Block-
chains can be joined by anyone. For example, those who wish to purchase a bitcoin join
in the chain. Because the public Blockchain is open and transparent, all transactions on
the chain can be seen transparently by all users. On the other hand, private Blockchains
are managed exclusively by the central authority, and accessing them requires approval.
They occur only in the form used primarily by a single company or a partner company,
or only authorized users can join the chain. Whether public or private, Blockchains are
basically impossible to manipulate as each transaction record or “block” cannot be

changed arbitrarily but is linked to all other blocks, guaranteeing its security. To
add a new block to this chain of blocks, other users must agree. How much user
consent is required depends on the Blockchain used. Some Blockchains require
50% agreement, whereas other Blockchains require more. Although this difference
can be small, the Blockchain is basically more secure than any existing networking
technology for this reason. Still, it is also true that Blockchain technology relies on
application software and encryption technologies; among the hundreds of startups
developing today's Blockchain technology, only a few of them are using unverified
algorithms. For example, in the case of bitcoin technology, SHA-256, which has
already been proven to be secure and effective, is used for hashing. Nevertheless,
several recent studies have predicted that quantum computing will ultimately break
the algorithm used for this technology.

Hacking a Blockchain network is not easy but also not impossible. The vulner-
abilities in the software used for networking could be the problem in this case, es-

pecially in coding.

8 Discussion

This study presented the architecture of the Blockchain using Blockchain technology
and artificial intelligence technology, which have recently become hot issues. This
architecture shows a variety of ways to achieve the unique distributed architecture of
the Blockchain. For the existing centrally stored database on the storage form of these
Blockchains, this study presented an unrestricted storage format in terms of time and
space using the IPFS system, which is a decentralized database storage system, such as
embedded cloud system and fog computing. This is based on various web-based lan-
guages such as HTML5, XML, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Java-based dis-
tributed object-oriented languages such as JSON. This study presented a practical
service model that is available for demonstration models. The reason Blockchain archi-
tecture is important is that Blockchain technology creates blocks to avoid modulation
and opens them to the entire node. Therefore, they are safe from security threats be-
cause they cannot collide with each other as a characteristic of Blockchain. This study
presented how to make these Blockchains. Many other Blockchain projects are still
emerging, but they could not be put into practice. One of the main reasons for this
may be the inability to create a working Blockchain dApp. Thus, in this paper, the con-
cept of making such practical Blockchain dApp was explained quickly and easily. It is
also expected to overcome the problems of Blockchain in the future with these Block-
chain characteristics. In addition, house rental services are currently being used via the
Internet and mobile without interlocks. The reason is that interviewers get a lot of
commission. Blockchain is also necessary for transparent transactions between land-
lords and tenants. These Blockchain technologies address the limitations of existing
real estate portals (platforms) by applying security to the verification of real estate data
by utilizing Blockchain on private property trading platforms.

9 Conclusions: based on house rental dApp image application model
It reduced real estate transaction fees and increased the reliability of data such as false
sales and fraud. The existing real estate market system is overhauled, whereas the in-

centive system through encryption is applied to secure a large number of participants.
Kim and Huh EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing (2020) 2020:47 Page 21 of 23

The areas where Blockchain technology applies in relation to real estate are compre-
hensive research systems, such as sharing and verification of sales lists, smart contracts,
land registers and registrations, history management, emotion, collateral and remit-
tance, building management, subcontracting, logistics management, and electronic tax
invoice. The tax collection dealt with in this paper applies these many advantages to
housing rent.

Moreover, in a traditional architecture, the current Blockchain has mostly been ap-
plied to private Blockchain, and much has been done. This study presented an architec-
ture that verifies and stores public Blockchain. This is due to the Half-storage
architecture, the inherent threshold of the private Blockchain. That is why, for P2P ser-
vice in the true sense, this thesis presented various languages, methodologies, and ar-
chitectures. In the future, we will conduct research on the work engine, various
artificial intelligence techniques, and theories of the rougher base so that we can auto-
matically verify and agree on work methods using machine learning and deep learning
of artificial intelligence. It also tackled the limitations of the Blockchain, and low data
becomes very important. That is because when low data is hacked or integrity is
broken, Blockchain becomes hard to trust as well. Therefore, we will study various
Blockchains by introducing Big Data analysis techniques that store and verify these low
data more safely and artificial intelligence systems that automatically verify these data.
