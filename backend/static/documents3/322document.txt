Abstract

In many cases occurring in the real world and studied in science and engineering, non-homogeneous fractal forms often emerge
with striking characteristics of cyclicity or periodicity. The authors, for example, have repeatedly traced these characteristics
in hydrological basins, hydraulic networks, water demand, and various datasets. But, unfortunately, today we do not yet have
well-developed and at the same time simple-to-use mathematical models that allow, above all scientists and engineers, to
interpret these phenomena. An interesting idea was firstly proposed by Sergeyev in 2007 under the name of “blinking fractals.”
In this paper we investigate from a pure geometric point of view the fractal properties, with their computational aspects, of two
main examples generated by a system of multiple rules and which are enlightening for the theme. Strengthened by them, we
then propose an address for an easy formalization of the concept of blinking fractal and we discuss some possible applications
and future work.

1 Introduction

The word “fractal” was coined by B. Mandelbrot in 1975,
but they are known at least from the end of the previous
century (Cantor, von Koch, Sierpinski, Fatou, Hausdorff,
Lévy, etc.). However, it is only in the last few decades that
fractals have known a wide and transversal diffusion and
the interest of the scientific world towards them has seen
an exponential growth. In fact, fractals have been applied
in many fields, from the dynamics of chaos to computer
science, from signal theory to geology and biology, etc.

Very interesting further links and applications are also those
between fractals, space-filling curves and number theory
(see, for instance, Caldarola 2018a; Edgar 2008; Falconer
2014; Lapidus and van Frankenhuysen 2000), or fractals
and hydrology/hydraulic engineering as we will recall better
below.

The main characteristic of a fractal, as it is well known, is
the property of self-similarity at different scales, and many
abstract mathematical models have been created by focusing
on this property. In most cases, a fractal is in fact mathemati-
cally described by a generating rule or an iterated mechanism,
but in the real world it is not difficult to find examples in which
it clearly emerges that a single simple rule is not enough to
build the fractal. So in recent years, there have been several
attempts and studies, some very successful, to implement tra-
ditional fractal theory. For example, a multifractal system is
a generalization of a classical fractal which uses a continu-
ous spectrum of exponents to describe its dynamics, in the
place of a single exponent, given by the fractal dimension,
in traditional models (see Bernardara et al. 2007; Falconer
2014; Harte 2001). For many natural phenomena, it is in fact
completely insufficient to use a model that provides a single
fractal dimension; multifractal systems have been typically

applied in contexts with different mass concentrations and in
chaotic dynamics, for instance, to the Sun’s magnetic field,
human heartbeat and brain activity, turbulent dynamics in
fluids, meteorology, geophysics, but also finance, internet
traffic, and others (see Falconer 2014; Harte 2001; Ivanov
et al. 1999; Stanley and Meakin 1988; Veneziano and Essiam
2003 and their references).

Another interesting example is given by the superfrac-
tal formalism introduced in 2002 by Barnsley, Hutchinson
and Stenflo. The class of deterministic fractals 1s not too
rich to study effectively the real world, because nature often
mixes deterministic aspects and casuality in its patterns.
Then, superfractals are precisely the models that are halfway
between deterministic and completely random fractals, and
present characteristics of both groups (for a comprehensive
introduction to 1- and V -variable superfractals, see Barnsley
2006).

In their experience in hydraulic contexts, the authors have
often found semblances and fractal properties emerging in the
course of various researches, especially in those conducted
by the second author since the 90s. For example, the applica-
tion of fractal models to hydrological basins, natural channel
networks, but also to urban rainfall catchments, marine waves
actions, shallow waters, and much more, has become a com-
mon topic in the scientific literature (see, e.g., Bernardara
et al. 2007; Rodriguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo 2001; Sivakumar
2017; Veltri et al. 1996; Yang et al. 2014). Recently, more-
over, the theory of fractals and fractal dimension has started
to be applied also to artificial infrastructures such as water
distribution networks, in particular in urban agglomerations,
as in Di Nardo et al. (2017); Diao et al. (2017); Kowalski
et al. (2014); Qi et al. (2014); Wu et al. (2009). The same
authors are conducting some research using tools such as
algebraic graph theory, fractal geometry and a new system
of local indices (see Bonora et al. 2020a, b,c; Caldarola and
Maiolo 2019, 2020a,b) in the study of water networks: in
the second case, the biggest challenge is to find a determin-
istic fractal model, without random components, but which
takes into account some temporal periodicities, for example,
on a daily, weekly, seasonal basis, which characterize urban
water networks. The same challenge arises in the study of the
fractal aspects of water demand, where a superfractal or mul-
tifractal model does not seem to be the most effective or the
most appropriate for the purpose, as well. Furthermore, these
models do not best respond to the request for structural sim-
plicity and ease of use by technicians and engineers who work
on real networks and who struggle constantly with important
complications and difficulties from a computational point of
view.

For the reasons exposed above, the authors are very inter-
ested to investigate and develop a fractal model as simple
as possible, but that can easily involve periodic changes as

needed. This could be the case of “blinking fractals” or some-
thing similar to them.

The idea of blinking fractal was introduced by Y. Sergeyev
in 2007 (see Sergeyev 2007) to describe fractals that assume
different shapes or configurations during their development,
with a cyclical order. As far as the knowledge of the authors,
they were successively applied only in Sergeyev (2011) up
until now, to model a process of growth in biological systems
(like the growing of trees through the different seasons of the
year).! We also inform the reader that in Sergeyev (2007) and
(Sergeyev 2011) blinking fractals are studied with the support
of anew computational methodology developed by Sergeyev
himself in the early 2000s to write and to perform calculations
with infinite and infinitesimal numbers in a handy and very
easy way as in the ordinary sets of natural or rational num-
bers N and Q (see Sect. 5 for some more information and the
references Amodio et al. 2017; Antoniotti et al. 2020a, b; Cal-
darola 2018b; Caldarola et al. 2020b; Sergeyev 2013, 2008,
2009, 2010, 2016, 2017). More precisely, a blinking frac-
tal is specified in Sergeyev (2007) as an “object constructed
using the principle of self-similarity with a cyclic application
of several fractal rules.”

The main purpose of this paper is to make a topological-
geometric contribution for the development and a concrete
future use of fractal models which present periodic changes
or alterations, as in the case of blinking fractals. In particular,
after some preliminary material recalled in Sect. 2, we exam-
ine in Sect. 3 the second example (and the first geometrically
constructed) given in the introduction of the article (Sergeyev
2007), the one where the name blinking fractal is used for the
first time. We deeply investigate Sergeyev’s sequence {Sn \
as described in Sergeyev (2007), firstly by considering sep-
arately the two subsequences {An \ and {Bn \ made up by
the odd and even indexed element, respectively. The sequence
{Bn \ clearly converges to a fractal S equal to the intersec-
tion of all B,, instead, such a property does not hold for
{An \ Hence we begin a series of computations that allow
to find the precise Hausdorff distance between any two ele-
ments of {A,}, (Proposition 2) and {B,} , (Proposition 3),
to get successively a general formula that gives the distance
for any two elements of {Sn}, (Theorem 1). As elementary
consequence, the sequence {Sn \ itself converges to S which
has Hausdorff dimension 3/2.

In Sect. 4 we use a three-rules system to define a sequence
of plane shapes { X;,} that has two subsequences {Y,} and
{Cn \ that converge to two different fractals, Y and C respec-
tively. Proposition 4 computes their exact distance.

Section 5 addresses conclusions and, from the point of
view of traditional mathematics, proposes to define a blinking
fractal of order m simply as a m-tuple of traditional fractals

! The reader can also see the book (Kaandorp 1994) for a rich com-
pendium of fractal models applied to growth processes in biology.
On the topological convergence of multi-rule sequences of sets and fractal patterns

(i.e., of blinking fractals of order 1). If we adopt this defini-
tion, Sergeyev’s sequence {Sn \ generates a blinking fractal
of order 1 and {X n \ a blinking fractal of order 2.

2 Preliminary definitions and results

This section collects and explains some necessary notations
and definitions together with some fundamental, well-known
properties of the recalled objects.

First of all, the symbols Z, N and Nt denote, as usual,
the sets of integers, of nonnegative integers and positive inte-
gers, respectively. The standard symbol R stays for the set of
real numbers and Rg for the set of nonnegative real ones.
Given two integers n < m, the writing [n .. m] is the
most common notation for discrete intervals, i.e., we set
[n .. m] := [n,m] Z where [n,m] stands for the real
interval as usual. A sequence will be indicated as {an}, en
{@n} ,» oF sometimes simply as dp.

We now continue by briefly recalling and explaining
some basic notations in fractal geometry that will be fre-
quently used in the next sections. For the benefit of the
non-mathematical reader interested in blinking fractals, we
will use, both here and in the next sections, a language as
simple and elementary as possible, also providing from time
to time enough details to facilitate reading.

For any N e N + we indicate by d the standard Euclidean
metric on R%. For x € R™ andr e€ RG, B,[x] denotes
the closed ball in R“ with radius r and center x, while, if
r > 0, B,(x) denotes the correspondent open one. If € is a
nonnegative real number and A is any subset of R, let Aj.)
be the e-hull of A, that is,

Ae} i= {* —€ R” : d(x, a) <« forsome a € A|

= LJ B. [a].

acA

Remark 1 In literature A.) has many names as, for instance,
the ¢-fattening, the ¢-parallel body, €-dilatation, or also the
e-neighborhood of A. The last name is more common but it
is preferable for the set N;(A) := {x € R* : d(x,a) <
€ forsome a € A}, because we cannot speak of open and
closed e-neighborhoods. In IR2, for example, Nj (B 1 ((0, 0)))
and (Bi ((0, O))) ey are both open sets, equal to Bz((0, 0)),
instead NV (Bi[(0, 0)]) = B2((0,0)) 4 (Bil, 0)]),,, =
Bz|(0, 0)].

It is important also notice for the reader that, for our pur-
poses, it will be quite more convenient to work with enlarged
sets of the kind Aj.) rather than \/;(A), hence in (1) we give
the definition of Hausdorff distance accordingly, among the
many possible ones.

{1}

17739

If A and B are two nonempty subsets of R% we define
their Hausdorff distance dy (A, B) by

dy(A, B) := inf {e >0:AC Brey and BC Aye}. (1)

It is simple to observe that, equivalently, we can also define
dy(A, B) as

dy(A, B) = max | sup inf d(a,b), sup inf d(a, b) ,
acA EB beBacAa

The function dy is not a metric in general, but it becomes so
if we consider the restriction of dy to the family

H(R*) := {K CR” : K compact and K # a}.

H(R™) is usually referred to as the hyperspace of nonempty
compact subsets of R, and it is not difficult to see that,
similarly to (R , d), the pair (H(R™ ), dx) is a complete
metric space. Moreover, if A, B € H(R™), then it is easy to
show that

dy(A, B) € {e >0:A C Bey and BC Agy}, (2)

1.e., the infimum in (1) is actually a minimum.

Lastly, we need to recall here a basic result from algebraic
combinatorics on words, because when we will draw conclu-
sions in Sect. 5 we will have too few space. Classic references
in the field are the first two Lothaire’s books (Lothaire 1983)
and (Lothaire 2002).

Let A be an alphabet, 1.e., a set of some distinct symbols
called letters; a word w over A 18 a finite sequence of elements
written

W = aja2...ady

with n € N* anda; € A. We also say that w has length n,
and we write |w| =n. The set A* of all words over A, i.e.

At := {w = ajd2...dn -n € N* anda; Ee A},

is a semigroup with the operation of concatenation, and if
1 denotes the empty word then A* := AT U {1} is a free
monoid (called the free monoid over A) because | acts as
neutral element. A word w € A” is said to be primitive if
it is not power of another word, 1.e., if w 4 1 and w = u”
for some u € A* andn € N implies u = w andn = 1.
The following result is a consequence of the so-called defect
theorem (see in particular Lothaire 1983, Proposition 1.3.1)
or can be also viewed as an immediate corollary of Fine
and Wilf’s theorem (see Lothaire 1983, Proposition 1.3.5 or
Lothaire 2002, Proposition 1.2.1).

Q) Springer
17740

Proposition 1 [f x” = y” forsomex, y € A* andn,m €N,
then x and y are both powers of some z € A”.

In particular, for each word x € A* there exists a unique
primitive word w € A* such that x is a power of w.

Let us make a few comments on the last claim in the previ-
ous proposition. If x is anonempty word, it is rather obvious
that there exists a primitive word w € A®* such that x is
a power of w (use, for example, a trivial induction argu-
ment on the length of x). Instead it is less obvious that if
x = w"” =v", with w and v primitive words, then w = v:
It follows from the first part of the same proposition.

3 Example: a deeper study on a “two-rule
fractal”

As first example, we want to consider a sequence presented
in the initiator paper (Sergeyev 2007) to blinking fractals:
Here we will deepen its analysis from a geometrical point of
view also making various computations that allow to prove
some sharp results.

From now on, we will often use the symbol J to denote
the closed interval [0, 1] C IR. We go to define a sequence
of compact subsets {Sn} en contained in R? and, to have a
clearer view of the constructive process, it is convenient to
imagine the elements S,, with an even index n colored in blue
and those with an odd index in red. The initial element So
is the square 7 x I C R2, colored hence in blue, and the
element S$; is given by

Sys f(x, y) €R?: |x — 1/2) + ly — 1/2) = 1/2| nr,

that is, the red area consisting of the four isosceles right
triangles with side 1/2 positioned in the four corners of 7, as
shown in Fig. 1b. To describe S$; by words, we could also say
that it has a vague shape of a square-rhomboid frame (square
externally and rhombus internally). Note, finally, that in the
passage from the blue Sg to the red shape S, we lose half of
the area.

Consider now Sz: It consists of 8 small squares of side
1/4 out of a total of 16 in which J 2 is divided, as illustrated
in Fig. lc. In particular, there are four squares in the center
and one in each corner. Note that in the passage from S$; to
S» we have no loss of area: All the red area of $; is in fact
transformed in the equivalent blue area of S$».

The process to obtain recursively the subsequent elements
of {Sn}, should be clear from Fig. 1. At the step 27, t € N,
the unitary square I? is divided into 47’ small squares of side
(1/4)! each one; 2*" of them are blue and form S2;. Then, to
obtain S2;41, we only have to replace each blue square with a
small red frame as in the transition from Sop to $;. And to get

S442, just replace each of the 2°’ small red frames that make
up S241 with a blue shape like S>, but 4’ times smaller.

To consider in future more complex model, we want to
remark as our sequence { Sn \ can also be viewed as the result
of the successive application of two rules: R; transforms a
blue square of side / into a red frame like S; with the same
external side /, and R> transforms ared frame F of side / into
a blue shape like $2, with the same area and diameter of F
(see Fig. 2).

For convenience in our presentation and to consider sepa-
rately the subsequences of {Sn \ with odd and even indices,
we set, for every n € N,

An := Son+1 and B, := Sop. (3)

rule R> at each of the 4?’ red frames that make up S244

The sequences {A,} and {B,} have different or common
characteristics on dependence of the point of view, as we will
see in the following. The simpler one is the second: It is in
fact a nested sequence of closed subsets of J 2 that is,

Bo D By D B2D...D By D Bn41D... (4)

Since each B, is nonempty, the family {Bn :neN } has
the finite intersection property (FIP) and, as well-known in
general topology, the intersection of all its elements ( },,-.j Bn
is nonempty as well and belongs to H(R?). In this case, it is
moreover obvious that the sequence {Bn}, itself converges
to the mentioned intersection which will be denoted by S; in
symbols

lim B, = () Bn —: S. (5)

n—> Oo
neN

It is very easy to visualize Sergeyev’s fractal S through the
decreasing sequence (4): S has a shape that presents some
vague similarities with the well-known Vicsek cross fractal
and the Sierpinski carpet.

The former sequence {An} is even more interesting

neN
than {Bn}. both because it seems unnoticed in the litera-
ture, and it is less evident that it yields a fractal; for instance,
on the contrary of what observed in (4), this time there are
no inclusion relations in the sense that

A; CA; forsomei, j ¢N > i=j, (6)

and the intersection {) A, has little to do with the limit of
neN
the sequence {Aj} _., if it exists (see, for example, Fig. 3).
Recalling the definition of Hausdorff distance given in (1),
we can state the following

A consequence of the previous proposition is that {An I en
is a Cauchy’s sequence in the complete hyperspace H(R?),
and hence, it converges to some S_' € H(R7’). The use of
Proposition 2 is not the shortest way to show that {An},
converges, but it has several advantages such as that of pro-
viding the reader with an effective and easy tool to investigate
the dynamics of other fractal processes. Moreover, Proposi-
tion 2 allows to treat the sequence {A,,} , independently from
{Bn}, and will be a piece of the proof of Theorem | just as
the next proposition will constitute another. As regards the
fractal S ’, it is actually equal to S and it is quick to prove
directly. We instead prefer to wait and to see it as corollary
of Theorem 1.

The next proposition establishes a twin formula of (7) for
the nested sequence {Bn \ The proof uses the same pattern
and is easier than that of Proposition 2; in any case, we will
give some details for completeness.

Let now m > n > | be fixed. Recall that B, = S$», is
constituted by 2°” squares of side length 1/4” and, if D;, i €

from B, to Bm, by a blue shape EF; similar to By—n with
ratio 1/4”. Since Dj C (E;) as in (13) we obtain

A general formula for the distance of two elements of the
original Sergeyev’s sequence { Sn I en is given by the follow-
ing theorem. During its proof, we will see as (15) reduces,
when n = m = | (mod 2) and n = m = 0 (mod 2) respec-
tively, to Formulas (7) and (14) stated for {A,} and {Bn},

used to this purpose; for example, S can be very easily viewed
as the attractor, or invariant set, of an iterated function system
(IFS) consisting of 8 similarities all with ratio 1/4. Since
it satisfies Moran’s open set condition, then the Hausdorff
dimension dim ;,, the box-counting dimension dim gz, and the
similarity dimension s are all equal and can be immediately

4 A “three-rule fractal”

Now we describe a fractal based on the cyclic application of
three rules, Sc, Sy and P, acting on a sequence {X,} x, of
geometric shapes in the real plane. The rules act as follows.

(1) Consider any square » of side / in the plane. Sc and
Sy subdivide it in 9 smaller squares of side //3, then Sc
select the four of them in the corners of 2’, instead Sj
takes the middle square for each side of 2’, as shown in
Fig. 4a, b, respectively.

(ii) To get P we need to define a family of actions {P; : i €
N+} as follows. Consider the unit square /* as consist-
ing of 9 smaller squares yI, D3, Lees Xy of side 1/3
and disposed anticlockwise starting from Dh with cen-
ter in (1/6, 1/6), x3 centered in (1/2, 1/6), and so on
until xy with center in (1/6, 1/2), and lastly the central
square xy (see Fig. 5a). P; acts on the x} as the cycle
y = CU, 2,3,4,5, 6, 7,8) belonging to the symmetric
group Sym(9) acts on [1 .. 9]. In other words,

yi, ifie([l..7I,
yy ifi=9.

Therefore, if A is a subcollection of {x sie [1 ..9]},
the meaning of P; (A) is clear.

For any i € [1 .. 9] consider now the square y} as
consisting of 9 smaller squares xP, EP, ees Z} 5 of
side 1/37; P> acts on the x as P; acts on the x, 1.€.,
through the permutation y; more precisely we set

this way to introduce inductively the notation xi ibsesiy?
where the superscript tf means that they are square of
side length 1/3’ and the subscripts i), i2,..., i; (or the
t-tuple (i,,i2,...,7;) 1f one prefers) are the “coordi-
nates” for the position of the square.* P; hence acts in
the obvious way as seen in (20) and (21) for the special

cases t = | and t = 2, respectively; we in fact define

the P;. Formally, for allt € Nt and ij, i2,...,i; € [1 ..

We now define the sequence {X n} nen by using alterna-
tively the rules defined in (1) and (11), organized in a “4-cycle”
as follows

Sc, P, Sm, P, Sc, P, Su, P, etc. (23)

We start by setting Xo := /*, and then we continue recur-
sively by using the sequence (23) as below

X1 := Sc(Xo),

X2 := P(X1) = (Po Sc)(Xo),

X3 := Sy(X2) = (Sy o Po Sc)(Xo),

X4 := P(X3) =(PoSyoPo Sc)(Xo),

X5 := Sc(X4) = (SC 0 Po Sy o Po Sc)(Xo),
etc.

> The attentive reader will think of using a pair of coordinates in base
3: This has the obvious advantage of easily positioning the square in
question, but the permutations P; would act in a less simple way to
write. Since our aim is to explain in as clear and elementary a way as
possible the dynamics of the permutations P; which play an essential
role in this section (as opposed to the exact position of the squares),
then we have consequently chosen a convenient notation system.

The subsequence {Yn \ instead, converges to a fractal Y that
has a “dust form” like C but is different and, actually, very
far from it as the following proposition specifies.

Proposition 4 We have dy(C, Y) = V5/6.

Proof Considering the set

d((0,0),W) = d((0, 0), (1/3, 1/6)) = 5/6 (where the

we conclude that dy(C, Y) = V5 / 6 as we wanted. Oo

Example 1 Multi-rule fractals are very interesting to investi-
gate in less elementary or easy cases than the previous one.
It is important to observe that the greater number of rules
does not correspond to a more complex fractal in general:
the reader, for example, can study the sequence {Zn} jen
produced by the previous system by using only the first two
of the three rules Sc, P and Sy, 1.e., starting from Zo = I?
and applying successively Sc, P, Sc, P, Sc, P, and so
on.

5 Conclusions and future work

The sequences {S,} x, and {Xn}, studied respectively
in Sects. 3 and 4, could both be called “blinking sequences”
because they exhibit two alternating geometric shapes. To
make a really skinny simplification, they behave similarly to
the following two real sequences

both {sn} x, and {xn}. present alternatively positive and
negative terms, but while the former converges to a limit
s = 0 likewise {Sn} en converges to S, the second has two
main subsequences convergent respectively to 2 and —2 like-
wise {X;,} has two subsequences {C,,} _., and {Yn}
convergent to C and Y, respectively.

From the examples and all the discussion made from the
previous sections until now, we therefore propose the follow-
ing definition.*

 

Xn = (—1)l"/2! (2-

neN

Definition 1 A blinking fractal B of orderm € N* is simply
an m-tuple of (not necessarily distinct) traditional fractals

B = (B,, By,...,Bm) € (H (R”)) (27)

such that the word 6,82... is primitive (recall the last
part of Sect. 2).

A traditional fractal can be viewed as a blinking fractal of
order 1, called also a simple fractal. For example, Sergeyev’s
fractal S, analyzed in Sect. 3, is a blinking fractal of order 1,
while the one presented in Sect. 4 is a blinking fractal B of
order 2 that can be written 6b = (C, Y).

It is important to note that in virtue of the unicity stated
in Proposition |, the order m of a blinking fractal is well
defined.

Example 2 Consider the set of fractals {C, Y} Cc H(R’)
defined in the previous section. We can obviously form

— 2 blinking fractals of order 1 as well as 2 blinking fractals
of order 2 (B = (C,Y) is in fact distinct from B’ =
(Y,C));

—~ 2+ 4 = 12 blinking fractals of order 4 (in fact the
writings (C,C,C,C), (Y,Y,Y,Y), (C,Y,C,Y) and
(Y,C, Y, C) do not represent a blinking fractal);

— 2? — 2 = 6 blinking fractals of order 3, 2° — 2 = 30
blinking fractals of order 5, etc.

See Proposition 5 below for a general formula that counts the
number of blinking fractals.

The study of multi-rule and blinking fractals seems very
interesting both from a pure mathematical point of view and

* First note that in this paper, following modern customs, we have
avoided to give a precise definition of (traditional) fractal; see the ubiq-
uitous discussions on the issue present both in fractal monographs, but
also online.
On the topological convergence of multi-rule sequences of sets and fractal patterns

for applications, and much work can be done in this direction
in our opinion. Just as a small example, the following ques-
tions arise immediately considering the sequence {Zn} nen
defined in Example 2, and many other multi-rule sequences
can be evaluated and investigated.

(i) Does the sequence {Z,} _., generate a blinking fractal?
(ii) If yes, of which order?

Also from an applied point of view, blinking fractals seem
rich of applications in many fields. Just to stay in the hydraulic
one, remember what was mentioned in the Introduction about
water demand in urban centers. In our experience, it is easy to
find recurrent fractal-like patterns on different sizes and time
scales, also very small, in the water demands, and we think
that some rather jagged plottings are in part due to the speed
with which modern taps with lever control and ball valve act
within the individual users. Then, in this context, it could be
of great help for the description and interpretation of data and
dynamics of a complex network, a model that uses blinking
fractals of order 24 or more, on a daily basis, or of order a
multiple of 7 (e.g., 168) on a weekly basis, etc. Similarly,
one could think that most of the human activities, within
the alternation between rest and work, could be studied or
approximated by models that use blinking fractals with order
some multiples of 24 and 7 as before, on dependence from
the observations.

Finally, some conclusions must be also drawn on the rela-
tionships between our Definition | and the paper (Sergeyev
2007) where the idea of cyclicity and periodicity associated
with fractals is originally proposed. First of all, in Sergeyev
(2007) the notion of order of a blinking fractal is not defined
and, indeed, our Definition | is completely inapplicable in
that context. This because all this paper and our discussion
is based on classical mathematics which uses heavily the
concept of limit (in fact, Sects. 3, 4 and Definition | con-
sider and investigate the limit behavior, in the usual sense of
fractal geometry, of a sequence of objects in the hyperspace
H(R™)). Instead, on the contrary, in paper (Sergeyev 2007)
the notion of limit does not exist at all because a different
numerical system is used, and the idea of blinking fractal
focuses there on the process that generates a fractal and not
on the limit object such as S, C or Y. In particular, our result
on the convergence of Sergeyev’s sequence {Sn} en does
not contradict the discussion in Sergeyev (2007) where the
sequence maintains its duplicity at infinity in a similar way
to what happens for the sequence {s,} _., defined in (26),
which, if evaluated at infinity with the methodology used in
Sergeyev (2007) gives rise to two opposite infinitesimals (one

17747

positive and the other negative),° while in this paper and in
Weierstrass analysis it converges to zero, as we already noted.

We end the paper by giving an enumerating formula for the
number v; (m) of blinking fractals of order m obtainable from
a basic set {F,, Fo,..., Fx} of k distinct simple fractals.
For this purpose we recall that in number theory the Mdbius
function 1 : Nt — {—1, 0, 1} is defined by

1 ifn = 1,
(—1)!

if nis the product of t distinct
w(n) = .
prime numbers,

0 if n has some multiple prime factor,

or, equivalently, j4(7) can be defined as the sum of the prim-
itive nth roots of unity (cf. the definition of primitive word
in Sect. 2).

Proposition 5 For every k,m € Nt we have

vem) = D> e(d)-k"/4,

d|m

(28)

where the sum runs over the positive divisors d of m.

Proof The proof is a standard application of Mébius inver-
sion (cf., for example, Lothaire 1983, Section 1.3) and, in
short, it boils down to recognizing that, fixed k belonging
to N*, the sequence {k’”} _, is the Mébius transform of

{vx (m)} oy .© To give some details recall that, in virtue of
Definition | and Proposition |, an m-tuple built with elements
belonging to a set of k distinct simple fractals uniquely iden-
tifies a blinking fractal of order a divisor d of m, hence we
have

kK" = YS o(d).

d|m

Using Mobius inversion formula (see, for instance, Apostol
1976, Theorem 2.9 or Schroeder 2009, Chap. 21), we then
get (28). Oo

> The discussion of Sergeyev’s methodology for numerical computa-
tions with infinities and infinitesimals goes beyond the aims of this
article, which instead wants to investigate the possibility of using blink-
ing fractals in classical mathematics and the usefulness of applying
them in the scientific and engineering fields. For more information on
Sergeyev’s method and its applications in various areas of mathemat-
ics, computer science and experimental sciences, we hence refer the
