Abstract

Teleoperated robots are expected to perform tasks in extreme environments such as disaster sites. However, only few
teleoperated robots are used for this purpose because their usability is poor compared to human skill in such tasks.
Further, the use of human-machine interfaces used by teleoperated robots is in itself a human skill. In this study, we
compare the skills of firefighters (experts) when using teleoperated robots and that of firefighters (novice) and analyze

the results. Firefighters gain technical skills required for fighting fires from practical experiences; in comparison, novice
firefighters have trouble acquiring these skills. We conducted a comparative experiment of the reconnaissance skills
of firefighters in which ten firefighters (five novices and five experts) reconnoiter two simulated fire sites (one in a resi-
dential area and the other in a commercial facility area) with a teleoperated robot. The experimental results indicated
that experts were more multifaceted in their evaluation of reconnaissance areas as compared to novices.

Introduction
In recent years, large-scale disasters have occurred fre-
quently globally. Various teleoperated robots have been
developed to quickly overcome problems, such as con-
ducting search and rescue for humans and reducing or
recovering damage to structures, and improve opera-
tional efficiency in disaster areas and dangerous work
sites; however, these robots are rarely used. Few of these
robots exhibit superior usability in terms of movement
and camera operations. In emergencies, it is important
to provide the operators of teleoperated robots with a
human-machine interface (HMI) that filters input infor-
mation effectively [1-5]. However, there are few reports
of teleoperated robots that reflect this knowledge.
Despite their infrequent current use and poor HMI,
the application of teleoperated robots is anticipated for
use at the sites of fires because fires are one of the most
common disasters that put firefighters at risk. Several

teleoperated robots have been developed for firefighting
to reduce the risk to firefighters [6-10].

In addition, because teleoperated robots are work
tools, we believe that the effectiveness of the work using
a firefighting teleoperated robot depends on the firefight-
ing skills of the operator. Yokokohji et al. [11] summa-
rized various knowledge about the information display
method in the rescue robots, but did not mention what
kind of information display method is used to assist the
skill shortages of operator. To fill the skill gap between
novices and experts or to improve the effectiveness of tel-
eoperated robots, several prior studies have evaluated the
differences in skill between novices and experts [12-22].
For example, in an investigation of robotic surgery train-
ing, Kumar et al. [12] designed evaluation criteria for
surgical skills by quantifying objective skill differences
between novices and experts. Similarly, Guru et al. [13]
evaluated differences in surgical performance with the
da Vinci Surgical System for surgeons with different skill
levels, ranging from novice to expert. Morioka et al. [14]
presented a work information database for cell produc-
tion assembly created by analyzing the working motions
of experts and extracting their skills to improve work effi-
ciency. Roy et al. [15] suggested the usefulness of using

human-accessible hierarchical semantic labels to teach
novices skills acquired by robots from experts.

Other prior studies have examined surgical operations,
assembly work in factories, grasping and transporta-
tion work in residencies, creative activities with LEGO,
communication, and nursing; however, differences in
firefighting skill between novices and experts with tel-
eoperated robots are yet to be clarified.

The mission of firefighting is to protect the lives of citi-
zens and properties from fires or disasters. At disaster
sites, mistakes by firefighters may result in immediate
loss of the lives of many citizens and damages to prop-
erty. Therefore, firefighting skills are indispensable for
maintaining a safe and secure society. However, it is dif-
ficult to acquire firefighting skills because fire sites are
diverse and most skills of a firefighter are derived from
experience. Furthermore, along with the diversification of
disasters and the evolution of firefighting equipment, the
required firefighting skills have become more complex
and advanced. Developing methods to teach firefight-
ing skills is a significant problem in various Japanese fire
departments [23]. In one recent countermeasure against
this problem, the Tokyo Fire Department proposed
methods to support knowledge succession with social
networking services [24].

We believe that there are additional opportunities for
improving the utility—especially in terms of HMI—of tel-
eoperated robots for firefighting by evaluating the differ-
ences in firefighting skills between novices and experts.
Although approaches with augmented reality (AR) or
virtual reality (VR) could be considered as methods for
analyzing firefighting skills, firefighting activities with
AR or VR are less realistic than using teleoperated robots
such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned
ground vehicles (UGV). Therefore, in this paper, we ana-
lyze the firefighting skills of experts by comparing the
behavior of novices and experts in a firefighting activity
using a firefighting teleoperated robot deployed at sev-
eral fire departments. Human skills develop through five
stages of skill levels: novice, advanced beginner, compe-
tent, proficient, and expert [25]. In this paper, “novices”
corresponds to the “competent” skill level and “experts”
corresponds to the “expert” skill level. As a first step
toward improving the HMI of teleoperated robots for
firefighting, we select a reconnaissance activity as the
analysis target; this is because reconnaissance at the site
of a fire is one of the most important firefighting activi-
ties. We create evaluation items to measure reconnais-
sance activity according to the basic tactics of firefighting
and compare the behavior of novices and experts based
on these evaluation items. This analysis result is useful for
improving the HMI of firefighting teleoperated robots for
reconnaissance, such as those used in [19-21]. Since the

Page 2 of 14

experiment in this paper uses the firefighting robot, the
results show the difference between novice and experts
firefighting skills using the robot. Therefore, we think
that researchers of disaster response robots can smoothly
use the results of this paper in the design of HMI.

The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: “Evaluation checklist items for reconnaissance”
details the evaluation checklist items to be compared
between novices and experts for reconnaissance. “Experi-
ment” section describes the experimental setup. “Result”
section outlines the results, and “Discussion” section dis-
cusses the results in detail. Finally, “Conclusion” section
provides the conclusions.

Evaluation checklist items for reconnaissance
Firefighting activities allow organized firefighting units
to regain control of disaster sites and return them to a
safe condition using firefighting skills and technologies.
Reconnaissance is a firefighting activity; its purpose is to
understand the disaster situation (structure damage, the
spread of fire, injured persons, and the operating condi-
tions of firefighting equipment) and develop a fire extin-
guishing and rescue method. In this paper, we define the
reconnaissance activity as the reconnaissance required
to find a water discharge point, and we confirm whether
there is a difference in the approach between novices and
experts in this activity. Therefore, we create two sets of
evaluation items based on the fundamental tactics of fire-
fighting: one evaluating the reconnaissance activity and
the other determining the water discharge point.

Basic firefighting tactics

All firefighting activities, including reconnaissance, are
based on common basic tactics. Basic firefighting tac-
tics for general buildings (for example, wooden and fire-
protected buildings) follow the ten principles provided
Table 1 [26]. All firefighters learn and practice these tac-
tics at the fire academy over half a year; therefore, even
novice firefighters have knowledge of the basic principles
of firefighting.

Evaluation items

We created evaluation items for the reconnaissance activ-
ity and for determining the water discharge point using
the basic tactics of firefighting. The evaluation items for
the reconnaissance activity are listed in Table 1. In this
study, reconnaissance is considered to start after people
are evacuated from the area, and therefore, searching
for injured persons is not included in Table 2. Next, the
evaluation items for selecting a water discharge point are
listed in Table 3. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test
to test Tables 2 and 3. This is because we thought that

Experiment

Experiment location

Figure 1 shows a diagram and photograph of the exper-
imental field, which measured 24 m (breadth) x 36 m
(length). Two fire areas—one simulating a residential
area and the other a commercial facility area—were
prepared in this field. The residential area, represent-
ing crowed houses and condominiums, comprised
one building and three passenger cars (red vehicles
in Fig. 1b) in the experimental field. The commercial

facility was meant to simulate a large shopping mall
(a fireproof building) surrounded by a parking lot. The
experimental field was prepared by reusing a firefighter
training facility.

Each area was divided by road cones and poles to
prevent easy movement between the two areas. The
reconnaissance starting point, from which the robot
moves, is the midpoint of these two areas. Nine marker
cones (Fig. 2) represented fire hydrants (yellow) and
fire cisterns (red) in the field. Fire points were indi-
cated by flags called “genjibata” (Fig. 3). We used three
types of flags in this experiment: white, yellow and
red, which respectively indicate the early, growth, and

high-temperature phases of fire smoke. In this experi-
ment, we did not simulate the progression of fire over
time.

Because the building and the flag in this experiment
were used in actual firefighter trainings, and because the
firefighting robot in this experiment has already been
equipped in several firefighting headquarters, we thought
that this experimental environment would be familiar to
firefighters, would be less likely to cause misidentification
of the this environment than a computer simulation, and
would reduce the variation in the level of understand-
ing of this experiment. Therefore, we did not use a com-
puter simulation but a real robot and environment in this
experiment. From the perspective of safety and feasibility,
we simulated fire hydrants and fire cisterns with marker
cones in consultation with firefighters.

Experimental configuration

To develop a practical situation, we assumed the follow-
ing conditions that were decided upon consultation with
experienced firefighters. Indeed, these firefighters were
not part of the experimental participant group.

Fire situation: An epicentral earthquake has caused
fires to break out simultaneously in many places in the
prefecture. Participants are firefighters in the A City Fire
Department (CFD:A). When all firefighting vehicles in
the CFD:A go out for firefighting activities in A City, a
request for support is sent from the B City Fire Depart-
ment (CFD:B) to the CFD:A. The CFD:B has received
information about the locations of the fires in B City, but
has not yet received water utilization information about
B City. All firefighting vehicles in B City are going out for
firefighting activities in B City and A City.

¢ Purpose of reconnaissance: To begin water discharge
as soon as the fire engine arrives at this area, the fire-
fighters in the CFD:A reconnoiter with the teleop-
erated robot and decide on positions for water dis-
charge.

¢ Reconnaissance timing: For the sake of simplicity,
participants start reconnaissance after the evacuation
of citizens was completed.

¢ Teleoperated robot: Fig. 4 shows the reconnaissance
robot for firefighting, “FRIGO-M” [27], which was
developed by the Mitsubishi Electric TOKKI System
Corporation.

This robot is a nonignitable and explosion-proof and
has a crawler mechanism and two cameras (one for
moving and the other for reconnaissance). Table 4 lists
FRIGO-M’s basic specifications.

Because operating this robot with an optical cable
is difficult, we set it up wirelessly in this experiment.

¢ Experimental participants: Ten firefighters (five
novices and five experts) participated in this experi-
ment. It is difficult for young firefighters to acquire
firefighting skills because many depend on practical
experience; therefore, many years of firefighting are
required to become an expert. In this experiment,

firefighting experiences, because most firefighters
become sergeants, who focus on protection and res-
cue, after 10 years of service.

that the weather condition is that of a day in summer.
This is similar to the seasons when this experiment is
carried out.

because it occurs under the same conditions. Further,
for a large number of samples, it would still follow a
normal distribution. We used a F-test to confirm the

presence or absence of a difference between the distri-
butions of novices and experts. The F value obtained
from these mean values and unbiased variances is 1.04.
Because the degrees of freedom of both the novice and
expert population are 4, Fy 9; is 6.39, based on the F dis-
tribution table (significance level: p=0.05). Since the F
value is smaller than Fo, ;, there is no significant differ-
ence between the two distributions—that is, the distri-
butions have equal variance. Since the populations of
novices and experts follow a normal distribution and
the distributions of novices and experts have equal
variances, we used a t-test to confirm the presence or
absence of a significant difference between the means
of the population of novices and experts. The t value

Page 9 of 14

obtained from this mean value and unbiased variance
is 0.06. Because the degree of freedom for this t-test is
8, to.o5 is 2.31, based on the t distribution table (signifi-
cance level: p=0.05). Since the t value is smaller than
tyo5, there was no significant difference between the
population means of novices and experts.

We compared the camera operations for reconnais-
sance by novices and experts. Table 10 summarizes
the camera operations of novices and experts for thor-
oughly checking one side of the commercial facility.
In Table 10, the numbers of camera operation show
the area that is divided into four sections on one side
of the building (Fig. 9). We specified how the camera
operation was performed with these sequences of num-
bers and used levenshtein distance to compare the dif-
ferences in camera operations between novices and
experts. The basis sequence for calculating the leven-
shtein distances is I, II, III, and IV, the most popular
sequence in participants’ results.

We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to confirm the
presence or absence of a significant difference between
the levenshtein distance of novices and experts listed
in Table 10, because we thought that the result of lev-
enshtein distance did not follow a normal distribution.
From Table 10, the p value was 0.90, and it was found
that there was no significant difference between the two
groups.

Therefore, in terms of reconnaissance time and
checking order, there is no significant difference
between novice and expert populations.

absence of a significant difference between the total
scores of novices and experts listed in Tables 11 and 12.

From Table 11, the p value was 0.012 (effect size:
r=0.76); it was found that there was a significant differ-
ence between the groups of novices and experts. Because
the effect size is higher than 0.50, a substantial difference
was confirmed [28].

From Table 12, the p value was 0.19 (effect size:
r=0.40), and it was found that there was no significant
difference between the two groups.

According to these results, experts evaluate reconnais-
sance areas with a more multifaceted perspective than
novices, even when reconnoitering the same area.

Figures 10 and 11 show the graphs of the evaluation
items from Tables 11 and 12, respectively. In these fig-
ures, the axis value of each item shows the number of
participants who fit each item.

Table 13 show the result of the novices’ interviews
on the evaluation items. From Table 13, all novices can
check more evaluation items if others point out.

Discussion

This study aimed to investigate the differences between
novices and experts for both a reconnaissance activ-
ity and for deciding on a water discharge point. We
assumed that there would be significant differences
for both tasks; however, no significant difference was
observed in the task of deciding the water discharge
point. We believe that the various shapes and types of
building are reasons why there is a significant difference

between novices and experts in the evaluation items for
the reconnaissance activity. Novices have insufficient
and biased experiences against the fire types on build-
ings, and therefore, it is difficult for them to organize
what to check for in a reconnaissance activity. However,
experts organize the items to check for reconnaissance
activity from their various firefighting experiences.

There was no significant difference in the tends of
novices and experts to operate monitor system. We
believe that this indicates that both novices and experts
are aware of the importance of looking the entirety of
the objects without omission to gather information.
However, unlike experts, many novices only look at the
current situation. It is thought that this is because nov-
ices have little firefighting experience and their imagi-
nation does not work well for what happens next.

The interviews confirmed that if novices are directed
to checklist items by others, they can perform recon-
naissance in as multifaceted a manner as experts
(Table 13). This may present a method of filling in the
gap between the firefighting skill and reconnaissance

abilities of novices and experts, such as in determining
the water discharge point.

For determining the water discharge point, theories of
water discharge (e.g., to discharge water from the wind-
ward direction) are common for firefighters independent
of the fire types, and we think that there is no significant
difference between novices and experts.

From these results, we consider that the evaluation
items for deciding on the water discharge point are items
that are not affected by differences in experience.

Because the human cognitive resource is limited, the
more information the HMI presents, the more ineffective
it is; we believe that information suitable for the purpose
should be extracted and presented appropriately.

The result of the recording sheets of the participants
(Table 7) and individual evaluation items (Figs. 12 and
13) are discussed in the supplementary information.
However, these discussion needs to cover the qualitative
differences between novices and experts. To confirm the
significant difference in the results for individual evalu-
ation items, the sample size used in this study is small,
and therefore, a more detailed experiment is necessary
for future work.

Table 7 indicates the differences between novices and
experts as seen in the reconnaissance order and selec-
tion of firefighting vehicle. Novices tended to check

commercial facility area first and to select the fire engine
B for this area, whereas experts tended to check the resi-
dential area first and selected diverse firefighting vehi-
cles. From the results of interviews and questionnaires,
we confirmed that the preliminary information given
influenced this decision, as the force of fire in the com-
mercial facility area was greater than in the residential
area. Almost all novices were sensitive to this informa-
tion, they checked the commercial facility area first with-
out considering the spread of fire in the residential area,
and they then selected the fire engine B for its discharge
amount. Although all firefighters learn the principle of
focusing on preventing the spread of fire to surround-
ing buildings, almost all novices were distracted by the
preliminary information. In contrast, all experts acted
on this principle without being distracted by the pre-
liminary information and considered more situations
than novices. Even though experts H and I checked the
commercial facility area first, this reason was to confirm
that there was no danger of the fire spreading outside the
commercial facility area, which they were not familiar
with. The above results indicate that novices tend to be
anchored in preliminary information.

combustion, and the influence of elapsed time. These
items are difficult to assess and the assessment depends
on many years of firefighting experience.

Figure 13 indicates the difference between novices and
experts in checking the source of fire. Fire extinguishing
methods change according to the source of fire. Since
experts understand that the cause of fire is important
for effective firefighting, they tend to check not only the
location of the fire but also its source.

Conclusion

In this study, we analyzed the firefighting skills of experts
by comparing the behavior of novices and experts in a
firefighting activity with teleoperated robots. By compar-
ing the behaviors of novices and experts during recon-
naissance, we confirmed that the difference between
novices and experts is the presence or absence of multi-
faceted evaluation. Experts evaluate the reconnaissance
areas in a multifaceted way and act based on that result.
In contrast, novices evaluate a limited range of the recon-
naissance areas. As stated in “Introduction” section,
“novices” corresponds to the “competent” skill level and
“experts” corresponds to the “expert” skill level in this

paper. The “competent” skill level indicates the ability to
identify important items within a limited range. There-
fore, many novices cannot evaluate reconnaissance areas
in as multifaceted a manner as experts can.

Interviews confirmed that if checklist items are pointed
out to novices by others, novices can perform as multi-
faceted an evaluation as experts. Based on the results of
this experiment, we believe that by developing the HMI
of firefighting teleoperated robots that presents evalua-
tion items on the operation screen, reconnaissance from a
multifaceted perspective similar to that of an experienced
firefighter is possible, even for novice operators. Casper
et al. [29] reported that more research on perceptual user
interfaces was needed for future development of HMI.
We believe that such a HMI with the function to present
information checked by experts is one of the good per-
ceptual user interfaces. Since the experiment in this paper
uses the firefighting robot, the analysis results of this
paper extract the firefighting skills using the robot. There-
fore, we think that the extracted skill, the multifaceted
perspective, can be directly used as necessary elements in
the design of HMI for disaster response robots.

Further, by reflecting the test results of this experiment
in the education system for firefighters, we expect nov-
ices to develop an early understanding of reconnaissance
skills.
