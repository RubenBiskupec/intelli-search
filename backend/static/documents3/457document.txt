1 Introduction

With the development of our country’s economy and society, the demand for the qual-
ity of talent English is becoming more and more prominent. Since the reform and
opening up, the scale of English education in China has been expanding. English edu-
cation has achieved fruitful results and remarkable results and has cultivated more and
more comprehensive talents with high language quality [1]. With the development of
the society and the adjustment of the economic structure, the demand for language
quality of the society has also changed. The contradiction between this change and the
objective of English teaching is beginning to show and become increasingly prominent.

In today’s society, the requirements for the language quality of talents are more and

more focused on the practical application. The college English test form and teaching
mode are emphasized on exam-oriented education, too much emphasis on the teaching
of English formal stiff, ignoring the essence of language use and the ultimate goal, thus
not better adapt to social development, to promote the role of English proficiency [2].
With the rapid popularization of the Internet, English education has provided extensive
development space, combining education with modern information technology, form-
ing a network teaching system [3]. The network teaching system is a new teaching way,
which is implemented by the computer and Internet technology in the virtual space.
Compared with traditional teaching, it has an irreplaceable advantage. The perfect net-
work teaching system can directly replace the traditional teaching process on the
Internet.

The specific contributions of this paper include:

(1) Propose an online teaching system for automatically generating test papers.

(2) Introduce the architecture of wireless sensor network, then give a teaching
experiment system of wireless sensor network based on genetic algorithm.

(3) A problem-based coding method is proposed, and based on the difficulty and test
points of the F fitness function, the parameters in the iterative process are dynam-
ically adjusted.

(4) The method of this article is applied to English teaching, and the running
efficiency of the stochastic optimization algorithm is improved by 7—17 times.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work,
followed by the methods in Section 3. The experiment is discussed in Section 4. Section

5 concludes the paper with summary and future research directions.

2 Related work

The English network teaching system has a great advantage over the traditional educa-
tional model, which is shown in the following four aspects: First, the network teaching
system is designed from enrollment, teaching, learning, self-test, examination, gradu-
ation, and statistics, and the whole process covers all aspects of education and training;
second is the use of IE landing, not subject to geographical, time constraints at any
time to study, self-evaluation, participation in the examination, and other operations;
third is the rational management and use of teaching resources. Fourth is that the stu-
dents’ study is arranged by themselves, which greatly improves the efficiency of learning
[4]. The automatic test paper system is one of the most important modules in the Eng-
lish network teaching system. At present, the core algorithms of the automatic test
paper system are divided into three categories: random algorithm automatic test paper,
backtracking test method automatic test paper, and artificial intelligence algorithm
automatic test paper [5]. Artificial intelligence is a new technological science for
researching, developing, simulating, extending, and expanding human intelligence the-
ory, methods, technology, and application system [6]. Artificial intelligence is a branch
of computer science. It attempts to understand the essence of the intelligent and pro-
duce a new way to human intelligence similar to react with intelligent machines; this
domain research includes robot, speech recognition, and image recognition, Natural
Language Processing, and expert system [7]. The artificial intelligence algorithm will set
Tan EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:134 Page 3 of 15

up some intelligent search questions based on human in the process of automatic test
paper generation, so it has certain guarantee for the two indicators of success rate and
examination quality [8].

The principle of cluster analysis is to assign data to different clusters or classes by at-
tributes, so as to achieve the process of data collection and analysis. The process of
classification is to use groups to group physical or abstract objects into classes with
similar attribute characteristics, then conduct directional analysis of different classes.
Cluster analysis is applied to many disciplines such as computer science, mathematics,
statistics, biology, economics, and so on as the basis of research. As a research branch
of statistics, cluster analysis is mainly focused on the cluster analysis based on distance.
Clustering is a process of searching a cluster, which is an unsupervised learning state,
and the cluster is also in a hidden state. The main difference between clustering and
regular classification is that clustering does not need to pre-design labeled classes or
data, but automatically classify and mark categories, which is an exemplary study of an
observational learning rather than a classification method. In general, clustering will
divide objects into several subclasses that are clearly defined; each object belongs to a
unique category. But in the clustering of teaching indicators, because of the non-
stationary signal characteristics, a fuzzy clustering algorithm model is introduced to
achieve effective clustering analysis. Fuzzy clustering can divide the cluster objects into
different categories, but the fact of membership is different from the clustering. In
order to solve the influence brought by the change of ability evaluation and avoid the
smaller number of subset sets and the tight distance of some clustering centers, the
time and space constraints are often used to adjust this kind of clustering.

3 Methods

3.1 Genetic algorithm

Genetic algorithm is a kind of randomized search method that evolves from the
evolution rule of the biological world (survival of the fittest, genetic mechanism of
survival of the fittest). It was first put forward by Professor J.Holland in the USA
in 1975. Its main feature is to operate directly on structural objects, without the
restriction of derivation and continuity of functions [9]. It has inherent hidden par-
allelism and better global optimization ability [10]. The method of probability
optimization can automatically obtain and guide the optimized search space, adjust
the search direction adaptively, and do not need the determined rules [11]. These
properties of genetic algorithm have been widely applied in combinatorial
optimization, machine learning, signal processing, adaptive control, and artificial life
and are also the key technologies in modern intelligent computing [12, 13]. Genetic
algorithm is usually implemented in a computer simulation. For an optimization
problem, a number of candidate solutions (called individuals) are represented by
abstract representations (called chromosomes) to better solutions [14-16]. In each
generation, the fitness of the whole population is evaluated, and multiple individ-
uals are randomly selected from the current population (based on their fitness),
and new life groups are generated through natural selection and mutation, which
become the current population in the next iteration of the algorithm [17-19].

The English online test system is a unified test for all candidates. It requires that in
every test, takers get the same indexes on each test paper. That is, the difference is con-
trolled in a smaller range. The people of setting questions should first set several con-
straints on the system, such as examination time, each question score, the type, the
difficulty coefficient of each question, the knowledge point of each question, the teach-
ing requirement of each question, and so on. According to the direction of the con-
straint, the genetic algorithm is used to search for the optimization continuously until a
test paper near the set condition is produced. Each computer can get a test paper with
higher reliability according to the algorithm. Since the papers are all in accordance with
the unified constraints, the test paper at the terminal will be the same, for example, the
difficulty closed to but not to repeat the test. It also brings unanimous fairness in the
examination. Therefore, in many fields of examination, the genetic test paper algorithm
is more commonly used. In the traditional genetic algorithm, it is not for the use of the
group so it is necessary to improve the genetic algorithm in the application of the
paper. First, the mathematical model of this examination paper is constructed. Nine
questions will be extracted in the system (2 listening, 2 vocabulary and grammar, 1
reading comprehension, 1 finished fill, 2 tenses, and 1 writing questions). And each
question has 4 attributes (topic, number, value, difficulty), so they can construct a 9 x 4
order target matrix A to represent the test paper structure.

in which 4,,~do, are the title of the question, @).~do2 are the number of the title,
d3~o3 are the score of the test, and 4,4~do, are the difficulty of the test. The 4 attri-
butes of each problem represent the constraints of 4 aspects. It points out the direction
for people to select excellent examination paper. The constraints that the matrix should
satisfy the maximum limit are as follows: the total score of the test paper is bound to

9 9
\~ai3 = 100 and number T type scores 5° aj3t;. The system of hearing problems
i=l i=1

should meet that every question is 5 points, a total of 10 points. Vocabulary and gram-
mar should meet that every question is 5 points, a total of 10 points. Reading compre-
hension should meet the total score of 20. The finished fill should meet the total score
of 20. The tenses should be 5 points per channel, with a total of 10 points. The writing
question should meet the total score of 30. The sequence number of the test question
is not repeated: that is, in the matrix A, there cannot be a case of the same two or a

few elements in the matrix. Otherwise, it shows that the test is repeated. The difficulty

3.5 (the highest degree of difficulty is 5). Although the final examination papers are
often difficult to meet every constraint we set, there are three hard conditions to be
Tan EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:134 Page 5 of 15

achieved for the system: the first is that the total score of the exam is 100, the second is
that the score of each type is the prescribed value, and the third is that there cannot be
the same topic. In the case, all of the three conditions can be reached. If a test paper
with a 3.5 degree of difficulty can be found, the test paper will be the optimal solution
of the genetic algorithm. If you cannot find a test paper that is just 3.5 of the difficulty

the suboptimal solution can be found. The number of each item and the number of
each type of question can be entered by an artificial method in the setting of a test
paper and the total score is 100 points. Therefore, each test paper meets the total score
constraints and the total score constraints for each class of questions at the beginning
of random volume extraction. Then judge whether there is the same question or not,
which can be avoided in the cross algorithm so the only thing that needs to be con-
trolled is the difficulty of the test paper. In other words, at the initial stage, each test
paper is difficult to find a test paper that is difficult to meet the requirements of the
setting by genetic algorithm. In this way, the target function is only set for the difficulty

of the test paper. The objective function can be defined as:
4
f= Sf ji (2)
j=l

in which f; is the absolute value of the actual value of the property of the j volume of
the current test paper and the difference between the attribute constraint values of the
j paper volume. w; is the weight of the difference factor. Now only the difficulty coeffi-
cient is considered, then the objective function can be simplified to:

f=f4ws (3)

9 9
in which f,_| 5° aj34;4/ 5 a1;3—ND| is the absolute error between the average diffi-
i=l i=l

culty of generating the test paper and the difficulty constraint of the set test. ND is an
artificially set test difficulty constraint. w, is the weight of the difference factor of the
difficulty coefficient. Generally, the fitness function is designed to be inversely propor-
tional to the objective function. In order to prevent the denominator from being zero,
the fitness function can be designed as:

F)=1/ ( - Sim) (4)

In the same way, only the difficulty coefficient can be simplified to:
Fy = (1 + f,wa) (5)

It can be seen that the better the F value is, the better the quality of the 1 test paper.
When F = 0, the best solution is found which fits all the constraints.

3.2 Establishment of a test paper model
The problem of generating test paper is expressed as a five tuple, which corresponds to
the attributes of each question, including subjects, contents, knowledge points,
Tan EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:134 Page 6 of 15

difficulties, etc. [20]. It is a set of finite variables, V= {vy, vo, ---, v,,}; L corresponds to
the range of each attribute, which is a finite number set, L = {h, lo, ---, ,}; S corresponds
to the constraint of each attribute and is a set of finite rules, S = {sy, 59, ---, s,,}; R corre-
sponds to the user’s constraint relation, which is a finite rule set, R = {r1, ro, «+, 7,}; C in-
dicates that the test questions selected from the test library to meet the various
constraints are a sequence of questions, C = {c1, C2, °**, c,}. The test paper problem solv-
ing is from the questions in the selected group of questions C which meet the L value
range of each item attribute V with the constraint conditions of S and R and it is a
multi-constraint problem solving, the answer is the approximate solution, and the tar-
get state is not the only (Veldkamp B P et al. 2017) [21, 22].

The “difficulty coefficient” reflects the difficulty and difficulty of the test, and the “dif-
ficulty coefficient” can also be understood as the “degree of ease factor.” The greater
the difficulty coefficient, the easier the test question is, and the smaller the difficulty co-
efficient, the greater the difficulty of the test. The determination of difficulty level is for
screening subjects. Usually, test difficulty is conducive to students’ learning, but a cer-
tain degree of difficulty can increase the degree of division, which is very important for
a comprehensive understanding and mastering of students’ learning situation. The diffi-
culty of the test is as follows:

p=1-d=1-e/g (6)

in which d represents the scoring rate, p indicates the difficulty of the test, e indicates
the average score of the question, and g indicates the full score of the test. From for-
mula (1), it shows that the lower the scoring rate is, the more difficult the question is.
According to the previous experience, the difficulty of the test is divided into four
levels: difficult problems (d< 0.3), more difficult problems (0.3 < d< 0.6), middle ques-
tions (0.6<d<0.8), and easy questions (0.8<d<1). The average difficulty of the test
paper is as follows [26-27]:

ND =) pidi/ > Pi 7)
i=l i=l

in which ND indicates the average difficulty of the test paper; m represents the num-
ber of questions in the test paper; i indicates the number of the test questions, i = 0, 1,
‘++, m; p; represents the difficulty of the i test; and d; indicates the score of the i test. In
this paper, the two-end analysis method is used to calculate the score of the test area:

D = (Ry-R_)/n (8)

in which D indicates the score of the test area and R;, expresses the qualified number
of the high group, and the top 27% of the examinees are selected as the high group. R;
expressed the qualified number of low groups, and 27% were low groups after selecting
candidates.

In the course of the test paper, the average difficulty of the test paper is closely re-
lated to the difficulty of the test questions. Since the probability of the selected ques-
tions does not depend on the results of other questions, the selection of the questions
is random, that is, to extract or not be extracted. Therefore, it can be seen that the ex-
traction method belongs to the random problem extraction event and also conforms to
the two-distribution function B(n,p) of the discrete random variable. The two
Tan EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:134 Page 7 of 15

distributions are the repeated sub-independent Bernoulli test. There are only two pos-
sible results in each test, and the two results are opposite and independent, which are
independent of other test results. The probability of event occurring or not remains un-
changed in every independent test, and this series of experiments is called 1 heavy Ber-

noulli experiment, which is as follows:

Py(k) = (e)pra"™ (9)
Q= np (10)
in which k represents the level of difficulty, k= 0, 1, 2, -:-, n, and n is positive integers.

p,(k) represents the probability of a difficulty level of k; Q indicates the average degree
of difficulty in the test paper. In the two-distribution function B(n, p), when the nv in-
creases, the probability p{x = k} first increases to the maximum and then decreases. This
probability distribution is in line with our expectation of the difficulty of the test paper,
which is the characteristic of “the big middle, the two heads.” In the application
process, the difficulty of the test is set to 4 level, that is, 7 =5, and the probability p is
obtained according to formula (5). Then, the value of n, p, k is introduced into formula
(4), and the percentage of each difficulty test paper in the test paper p,(k) is obtained.
Then, the p,(k) number multiplied by the total number of questions can get the num-
ber of questions that need to be extracted from each level of difficulty.

3.3 Design of the test paper based on the genetic algorithm

Genetic algorithms cannot directly deal with the parameters of the problem space.
They must be converted into chromosomes or individuals in a genetic space consisting
of a certain structure. This conversion operation is called the encoding and can also be
represented (representation). In this paper, binary coding is selected for the problem of
the test paper, and 0 indicates that the test question is not selected, and 1 indicates that
the question is selected. A test paper is taken in a test paper as a chromosome. Each
item is regarded as a gene. The value of the gene is determined according to the item
number of the test question, so the chromosome encoding of a test paper is expressed
as(G 1, Go, G3, °°, G, +++, G,,),i= 1, 2, -*, nm. nm represents the total number of questions in

the test paper, and G; indicates the title number of the test. In the process of coding,

the same type of questions will be put together, such as choice questions, fill in ques-

tions, simple answer questions, and so on. In order to ensure that the examination
points are different, the codes of each fund are not duplicated. If different types of
questions may appear the same test sites, the same number of test questions may ap-
pear in genetic coding, because they belong to different types of questions and do not
affect the correctness of test papers.

In the initial encoding process, according to the examination of the contents of the
selected and the number of all kinds of questions, in the unity of the type of questions
not repeated, the principle of senior high school entrance examination was randomly
selected from a group of questions in the test, the test on the test type, which meet the
chromosome fraction, producing initial population. Because genetic algorithm is differ-
ent from other heuristic algorithms, it mainly searches for the best solution locally, and
the global search ability is poor. Therefore, the initial population is directly related to
the speed and quality of the final solution.

A fitness value is specified for each solution (chromosome), which is specified accord-
ing to the actual approaching degree of the problem solving (so as to approximate the

answer to the problem). Do not confuse these “solutions” with the question “answer,”
and you can understand it as an answer to the characteristics that the system may need
to use. The fitness function of this paper is as follows:

fi = Sd; (11)

in which d; is the item selected in the chromosome test point; m indicates the num-
ber of test questions, i=1, 2, ---, m; f, represents the fitness function value, 0</f, < 1;
and the smaller the f;’s fitness value is, the more it meets the requirements of the user.
Meet the test sets by Q which is said to contain the test point. When d; = 1, d; does not
belong to the set O. When d;=0, d; belongs to the set Q. For this index, the fitness
function fis set:

fy = |DC-NDXS| (12)

in which DC represents the difficulty coefficient of the test paper; NDXS indicates the
difficulty coefficient specified by the user; 0<f,< 1, the smaller the f,’s fitness value is,
the more it meets the requirements of the user. Therefore, the overall fitness function
of the test paper can be set as follows:

1 Mm
= =—) d,+|DC-NDXS 13
Po=fithe= dat | (13)

In the initial population, the evaluation value of each chromosome is calculated ac-
cording to the fitness function. The higher the evaluation value is, the greater the prob-
ability of the next iteration is. In order to ensure the diversity of the population, the
iterative probability of F(i)/ X F(i) is set in this paper. In the genetic algorithm, the cross
probability Pc and the mutation probability Pm are the key links and the performance
of the direct genetic algorithm. In the iterative process, the greater the cross probability
Pc and the mutation probability Pm, the stronger the ability to produce new chromo-
somes. The smaller the crossover probability Pc and the mutation probability Pm, the
algorithm easily converges the individual quickly and may produce the early ripening
phenomenon. On this basis, the cross probability Pc and the mutation probability Pm
are set up.

tween router and wireless network is 15 Mbps in link bandwidth with delay of 2 ms.

As in fact, downlink traffic is always higher than uplink traffic, given there are two
downstreams and one downstream at a time; nodes S1 and S2 respectively send TCP
downstream to D1/D2; and wireless transmission rate is constantlyl11 Mbps. D3 sends
TCP upstream, and at the beginning, wireless transmission rate is constantly 11 Mbps,
but later gradually decreases, 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps respectively at 20 s/40 s; thus, a sce-
nario of wireless network is created. The experiment summarizes uplink/downlink
flow’s average holding-time ratio in the channel and network throughout rate. The
average holding-time ratio of uplink/downlink flows in the channel can be seen in Fig.
2 and network throughout rate in Fig. 3.

In order to detect the validity of the genetic algorithm in this paper, the English
course is taken as an example to compare the method of this paper with the random
optimization algorithm. First, determine the amount of various types of test questions
in the specific circumstances, as shown in Table 1. The number of various types of
questions in the test paper is determined here, as shown in Table 2. The difficulty of
setting up a whole test paper is 0.520, and a total of 4 levels of difficulty, that is, 1 =5.
According to the average difficulty level of formula (5) that is Q = 0.52 x 5 = 2.6, the dif-
ficulty distribution of the topic in the test library is shown in Table 3. The problem dif-
ficulty distribution is shown in Fig. 4.

(1) Study the influence of various parameters in genetic algorithm on the conver-
gence of the program. First, fix the total iteration number K to 120, and set the number
of iterations to 120. When the number of iterations reaches 120 or the best individual’s
target evaluation value is F, the algorithm terminates iteration and outputs the final
value.

The number of populations was set to 50, Pc=0, and Pm =0, which were run ran-
domly, and the results showed that the chromosomes were not produced to meet the
requirements of the users. Because when the crossing probability Pc and mutation
probability Pm are all 0, only the selected operation is not optimized in the iterative
process, and the search space is too limited, so it is difficult to find the global optimal
solution.

The set population is 50, and the values of Pm =0.001 and Pc are set to 0, 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, and 1.6 different values, respectively. It can be seen from Table 4 that when
the value of parameter Pc is in the range of 0.2~1, the number of successful test papers
and the average evolution algebra two indicators all increase first and then decrease
with the increase of Pc.

The set population is 50, Pc =0.6, Pm is set to 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 4 different
values. The results are shown in Table 5. Figure 1 is a random selection of a set of

convergent graphs at different Pm values. From Table 5, it shows that the number of
the success of the paper and the two indexes of the average evolutionary algebra show
a tendency to increase first and then decrease with the increase of Pm. The influence of
parameter crossover probability on algorithm convergence is shown in Figs. 5 and 6.

(2) Comparison with random algorithms

According to the results of Tables 4 and 5, the value of Pc is set in the range of
0.6~0.9. The value of Pm is set in the range of 0.001~0.1, and the population size is set
to 50. Genetic algorithm and random algorithm are used to simulate the test paper,
and the time comparison table that meets the user’s requirements is generated. The re-
sults are shown in Table 6. Figure 7 is a convergent contrast diagram of random selec-
tion of a set of genetic algorithms and random algorithms.

It is clearly evident from Table 6 that the use of genetic algorithms in the process of
finding the optimal solution is far less than the random algorithm. Due to the global
search in genetic algorithm, the range of search is large. According to fitness value, we
choose iterated chromosomes and search for the direction of the best solution, which

makes it easier to search for the optimal solution. From the results of the whole

multi-constrained target effectively, that is, intelligent test paper generation of exam

optimal solution.

5 Results and discussion

As China continues to open to the outside world, progress of science and technology, im-
provement of international status, and the urgent need for a large number of professionals
proficient in foreign languages, with the acceleration of China’s “four modernizations”
process, make our country play a more active role in international affairs. Therefore,
learning English well is of great practical significance and far-reaching historical signifi-
cance for the realization of the above goals. In traditional English learning, examination is
a very important link. It is a test of students’ learning outcomes. Teachers need to spend a
lot of time and energy on problem solving, remarking, and statistical scores. It not only
takes time and effort, but also has many disadvantages. With the combination of com-
puter technology and education, examination as an important means to test teaching
quality and students’ comprehensive ability also needs to be reformed. An efficient, fast,
and scientific English test management system is urgently needed. The use of computer
technology for automatic test paper is a key link of English test management system, intel-
ligent test system mainly refers to the computer according to the test parameters of the
examiners appointed, and it is a typical multi-constraint problem to extract the test paper
which satisfies the constraints of the test paper from the English test question bank. Aim-
ing at the problem of test paper generation in English, this paper designs an improved
genetic algorithm to solve it. Through experimental analysis, the design method of this

paper satisfies users’ requirements for questions, contents, and scores.
