Abstract

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2016, around 800,000 of individuals have committed
suicide. Moreover, suicide is the second cause of unnatural death in people between 15 and 29 years. This paper
reviews state of the art on the literature concerning the use of machine learning methods for suicide detection on
social networks. Consequently, the objectives, data collection techniques, development process and the validation
metrics used for suicide detection on social networks are analyzed. The authors conducted a scoping review using
the methodology proposed by Arksey and O’Malley et al. and the PRISMA protocol was adopted to select the
relevant studies. This scoping review aims to identify the machine learning techniques used to predict suicide risk
based on information posted on social networks. The databases used are PubMed, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore and
Web of Science. In total, 50% of the included studies (8/16) report explicitly the use of data mining techniques for
feature extraction, feature detection or entity identification. The most commonly reported method was the Linguistic
Inquiry and Word Count (4/8, 50%), followed by Latent Dirichlet Analysis, Latent Semantic Analysis, and
Word2vec (2/8, 25%). Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Principal Component Analysis were used only in
one of the included studies (12.5%). In total, 3 out of 8 research papers (37.5%) combined more than one of those
techniques. Supported Vector Machine was implemented in 10 out of the 16 included studies (62.5%). Finally, 75%
of the analyzed studies implement machine learning-based models using Python.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in
2016, nearly 800,000 people have committed suicide [1 ].
Suicide is a tragic situation that affects families, neighbours,
leaving significant effects on those who survive. It is consid-
ered the second cause of unnatural death in people between 15
and 29 years old [2].

The report on “death statistic according to cause of death in
Spain” published by the National Statistics Institute, in 2017,
the last year for which data is available, states a total of 3679
suicides. Moreover, 140 fewer suicides than the previous year
have been reported in 2018 (3539) [3]. The multiple scenarios
that families and individuals face in their daily routine can
lead to this tragic situation. Consequently, committing
suicide is a critical public health challenge that numer-
ous countries address in different manners [4].

Suicidal behaviours are a complex phenomenon that is in-
fluenced by multiple factors such as biological, clinical, psy-
chological, and social considerations [5]. On the one hand,
suicide is preceded by milder manifestations, such as thoughts
of death or suicidal ideation [6]. On the other hand, suicide is
closely related to the model of society in which an individual
lives [7]. Moreover, it is directly related to the experience of
high-stress circumstances and lifestyle changes [8].

Currently, the effects of COVID-19 and isolation will
cause a significant emotional impact worldwide [9]. In partic-
ular, people who have suffered from mental health diseases
are in an even more fragile situation [10]. Therefore, an in-
crease in anxiety and depression disorders, drugs use, loneli-
ness, domestic violence and even suicide are expected to oc-
cur in these individuals [11]. Consequently, the risk of suicide
attempts has increased among the population [9].
Multiple novel factors contribute to an increase in sui-
cide risk [12]. In particular, the measures for prevention
of COVID-19 that includes social distancing plans are
strictly related to suicide risk [9].

The reduction in physical contact can lead to loss of pro-
tection against suicide [9]. These factors will be even more
relevant among people who have previous mental health prob-
lems [13]. Social distancing is necessary to control the
COVID-19 pandemic and decrease the propagation of
the virus [14]. However, a global perspective on indirect
mortality is also essential [15]. Social distancing is con-
nected to an increased risk of suicidal behavior [16].
Therefore, social distancing must be addressed through
a global intervention plan that implements new models
to combat physical distancing using social networks
[17]. In this context, several new technologies have
been identified as a crucial resource to detect people
in suicide risk [18].
J Med Syst (2020) 44: 205

Furthermore, young people who constitute a vulnerable group
commonly use social networks [19]. Social networks are a pop-
ular method of communication between people [20].
Consequently, social networks are an appropriate method to rec-
ognize the behaviour of the person according to the content of
their posts [21]. The analysis of the user’s posts on social media
is a complex problem [22]. The complexity is even higher if the
objective is to estimate the suicide risk [23]. Also, if the analysis
is carried manually by experts, discrepancies usually occur due to
the peculiarities of the language used in social networks [24].
Therefore, automatic architectures that use machine learning
(ML) methods should be developed.

Nevertheless, numerous of these automated systems require the
availability of datasets that allow the training of predictive models
which is a critical limitation [25]. On the one hand, these datasets
currently do not exist, or they have limited specifications. On the
other hand, unsupervised models do not require training.
However, these models need datasets for validation [26].

Currently, the use of ML techniques to analyze health-related
data is a trending topic. Moreover, the use of different systems
based on ML in different areas, such as disease diagnosis and
bioinformatics presents promising results [27-33]. In particular,
for mental health, various models and tools for suicide risk pre-
vention have been proposed in the literature [34].

This scoping review aims to identify the current ML techniques
used to predict suicide risk based on information posted on social
networks. This paper reviews the state of the art on this topic
focusing on the ML methods, the objectives, the data collection
techniques, the development process and the validation metrics
used. The main contribution of this study is to summarize the state
of the art and to provide a description of the common outcomes
and limitations of current research to support future investigations.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the methodology concerning the search
strategy, study selection criteria, screening process, and data
extraction. The included studies are analyzed in Section 3 and
are discussed in Section 4. Finally, the most relevant findings
and the limitations of the study are summarized in Section 5.
The PRISMA extension for conducting scoping reviews, the
technical details of the machine learning techniques, internal
validation strategies and main outcomes of the selected studies
are included as supplementary material.

Methodology
Overview

This study summarize the requirements and methods for en-
hanced suicide risk assessment using social networks.

Page3of15 205

Consequently, the authors conducted a scoping review using
the methodology proposed by Arksey and O’Malley et al.
[35]. Furthermore, the authors have followed the PRISMA-
ScR proposed by Tricco et al. [36]. The overall procedure is
annexed as supplementary material (Appendix JI).

On the one hand, Arksey and O’Malley et al. [35]
framework is widely used on scoping reviews
concerning the health domain. This framework presents
relevant recommendations to summarize findings and
identify research gaps in the existing literature. On the
other hand, the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews
built by Tricco et al. [36] defines a checklist of the
significant items to be reported when a scoping review
is conducted.

Search strategy

The authors have performed a systematic review to
identify relevant papers that use suicide risk assessment
models in social networks. The search has been con-
ducted during March 11-13 of 2020. The databases
used are PubMed, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore and
Web of Science since they are the most relevant sources
and include the most significant scientific work. The
authors have defined the search terms, and the selection
of the studies focus on literature written in the English
language.

The search string used in the databases was: [“suicide”
AND (“social networks” OR “social network”) AND
“algorithm’’].

Study selection criteria

To select the relevant studies on this topic, the authors defined
the following inclusion criteria:

¢ English language.

¢ Types of studies: Research paper, Clinical Trial and Case
Study.

¢ Published from 2010 up until December 2019.

¢ Focus on suicide.

¢ The studies include algorithms or models to estimate sui-
cide risk using the social network.

The research papers were excluded if they were not
written in the English language, do not include a spe-
cific suicide intervention or do not report information
regarding technical aspects of the model/algorithm used
to detect suicide risk on social networks.

Screening process

The screening process of the papers obtained through the
search strategy was performed by two authors independently
(GC and GM). The process was divided into two phases.
Firstly, the authors have reviewed the title and abstract.
Secondly, the authors have analyzed all the manuscript. The
conflicts were resolved by common consensus.

Data extraction

The extraction of the data from the selected studies was per-
formed by four authors (GC, GM, OR and ED). The authors
examined the completed form for consistency and accuracy.
The extracted data is split into two sets, such as general and
technical information. General information refers to the title,
year, authors, objectives and methods included in the study.
The technical information set is based on Luo et al.’s guide-
lines [37] and contains the following categories:

¢ Objectives: refers to the main goals of the proposed ML
models. A taxonomy was defined to describe those goals:

o Text Classification: Models that aim to classify post
into several categories, including a binary classifica-
tion, based on post content.

o Entity Recognition: Models that aim to identify sever-
al public entities in the text.

o Emotion Recognition: Models that aim to identify
emotions expressed in the post content.

Oo Feature Extraction: Models that aim to collect infor-
mation regarding characteristics of the post content
such as lexical, semantic or sentiment features (word
polarity).

o Topics Identification: Models that aim to analyze
themes being addressed in the dataset or the posts.

Oo Features Selection: Models that aim to select automat-
ically features, including optimization and feature re-
duction, to be included as predictor parameters in the
predictive model.

o Score Estimation: Models that aim to estimate a quan-
titative suicide risk value.

¢ Data Collection
o Data sources: refers to where the data set for the study
is collected. We have followed the taxonomy used by
Gonzalez-Hernandez et al. [38]:
= Generic Social Network (GSN): Social network con-

taining information about a range of topics (e.g.
Twitter, Facebook and Instagram).

J Med Syst (2020) 44: 205

= Online Health Community (OHC): Domain-specific
networks that are dedicated exclusively for discussions
associated with health.

© Inclusion and exclusion criteria: information regard-
ing what method was followed to include the data in
the data set. The authors define the following possible
categories:

= Keywords: This category includes all studies that de-
fined a set of keywords, hashtags, or phrases to be used
as queries or filters.

= Direct Selection: A set of participants is selected, and
then, data from their social networks are included.

o Time spam: refers to the period when data was
collected.

o The number of posts: Dataset size referred to as the
number of tweets/posts used.

o The number of participants: Number of users/
participants of whom posts were included in the
dataset.

o Data description: basic statistics used to describe the
dataset in terms of posts classes defined according to
the model objectives. For example, the number of sui-
cide risk positive posts, neutral posts, and negative
posts.

o Ethics: refers to the inclusion of information about
ethical issues and whether ethical approval was ob-
tained from an Ethical Committee for conducting the
study.

¢ Model Development Process

o Data pre-processing: The data preparation techniques
such as cleaning, transformation, outliers removal, or
missing values processing, were reported in the study.

o Data preparation: The process of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) based model development includes
a Stage in which several parameters are extracted from
texts to be used as potential predictor parameters in the
model. Most of the techniques used in the data prepa-
ration stage are based on data mining. In this category,
the authors focus on those data mining techniques for
feature extraction, feature detection or entity recogni-
tion. Moreover, the authors have collected explicitly
mentions about the use of different technologies such
as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Latent
Dirichlet Analysis (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
Word2vec, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

o Sentiment analysis: Type of sentiment analysis used in
the study.
J Med Syst (2020) 44: 205

o Dataset Annotation: The labelling process followed
for dataset annotation. The authors defined the follow-
ing possible methods:

the participation of humans that assessed post contents
and assigned one of the possible classes defined.

= Corpus: Authors used an existing annotated corpus to
train and test the proposed predictive models.

= Previous Scores: An assessment using a standard scale or
other quantitative instrument was previously conducted.
Then, posts were labelled according to the user’s score.

final model.

Results

The authors retrieved 426 articles in the search conducted in
research databases. After removing duplicates, 424 items were
selected for screening. The title and abstract review stage re-
sulted in the exclusion of 344 articles since most of the studies
do not cumulative focus on suicide risk, social networks and
ML methods. After the application of the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, 19 papers are included in this work. Three articles
were excluded in the full-review stage. One study was exclud-
ed since it is based on suicidal behaviour without including a
social media analysis [39] . Another study was excluded be-
cause it proposes an approach to analyze social media posts
for suicide detection, but the authors did not develop any
model [40]. Finally, the last exclusion in this stage was con-
ducted since the study proposed by [41] does not include ML
techniques.

From the full-text review, 16 articles were then selected for
inclusion [26, 42—56]. The flow diagram representing the search
process is shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the detailed information
is presented as supplementary material (Appendix I).

The results of the application of artificial intelligence algo-
rithms or models for suicide risk identification using data col-
lected from social networks have been analyzed in this study.

Furthermore, this paper presents a summary and comparison
of the state-of-the-art methods and technical details that ad-
dress this critical public health challenge.

Description of the included studies

This section introduces a brief description of the articles in-
cluded in this scoping review.

Ambalavan et al. 2019 [42] developed several methods
based on NLP and ML to study the suicidal behaviour of
individuals who attempted suicide. The authors built a set of
linguistic, lexical, and semantic features that improved the
classification of suicidal thoughts, experiences, and suicide
methods, obtaining the best performance using a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Birjali et al. 2017 [43] presented a method based on ML
classification for the social network Twitter to identify tweets
with risk of suicide. The authors used SVM, where SMO
(Sequential minimal optimization) is implemented as the best
model in terms of precision (89,5%), recall (89,11%) and F-
score (89,3%) for suspected tweets with a risk of suicide.

Burnap et al. 2017 [44] developed a set of ML models
(using lexical, structural, emotive and psychological features)
to classify texts relating to communications around suicide on
Twitter. This study presents an improved baseline of the clas-
sifier using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and maximum
probability voting classification decision method.
Furthermore, the proposed method achieves an F-Score of
72.8% overall and 69% for the suicidal ideation class.

Chiroma et al. 2018 [45] measured the performance of five
ML algorithms such as Prism, Decision Tree (DT), Naive
Bayes (NB), RF and SVM, in classifying suicide-related text
from Twitter. The results showed that the Prism algorithm had
outperformed the other ML algorithms with an F-Score of
84% for the target classes (Suicide and Flippant).

Desmet et al. 2018 [46] have implemented a system
for automatic emotion detection based in binary SVM
classifiers. The researchers used lexical and semantic
features to represent the data, as emotions seemed to
be lexicalized consistently. The classification perfor-
mance varied between emotions, with scores up to
68.86% F-score. Nevertheless, F-scores above 40%
was achieved for six of the seven most frequent emo-
tions such as thankfulness, guilt, love, information,
hopelessness and instructions.

Du et al. 2018 [47] have investigated several tech-
niques for recognizing suicide-related psychiatric stressors
from Twitter using deep learning-based methods and
transfer learning strategies. The results show that these
techniques offer better results than ML methods. Using a
Convolutional neural network (CNN), they have im-
proved the performance of identifying suicide-related
tweets with a precision of 78% and an F-1 Score of

ML algorithms. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
based psychiatric stressors recognition presented the best
F-1 Score of 53.25% by exact match and 67.94% by in-
exact match, outperforming Conditional Random Fields
(CRF).

Fodeh et al. 2018 [48] proposed a suicidal ideation detec-
tion framework that requires a mintmum human effort in an-
notating data by incorporating unsupervised discovery algo-
rithms. This study includes LSA, LDA, and NMF to identify
topics. The authors conducted two analysis with k-means clus-
tering and DT algorithms. DT showed better precision
(84.4%), sensitivity (91.2%) and specificity (82.9%).

Grant et al. 2018 [49] automatically extracted informal latent
recurring topics of suicidal ideation found in social media posts
using Word2vec. The proposed method uses descriptive analysis
and can identify similar issues to the expert’s risk factors.

Jung et al. 2018 [50] have implemented an ontology and
terminology method to provide a semantic foundation for an-
alyzing social media data on adolescent depression. They
evaluated the ontology obtaining the best values of precision
(76.1%) and accuracy (75%) using DT algorithms.

Liu et al. 2019 [51] performed a study to evaluate the fea-
sibility and acceptability of Proactive Suicide Prevention
Online (PSPO). PSPO is a new approach based on social
media that combines proactive identification of suicide-
prone individuals with specialized crisis management. They
evaluated different ML models in terms of accuracy, preci-
sion, recall and F-measure to get the best performance. The
SVM model showed the best performance overall, indicating
that PSPO is feasible for identifying populations at risk of
suicide and providing effective crisis management.

O’Dea et al. 2015 [52] studied whether the level of concern
for a suicide-related post on Twitter could be determined based
solely on the content of the post, as judged by human coders and
then replicated by ML. They evaluated ML models and decided
that the best performing algorithm was the SVM with Term
Frequency weighted by Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF).
The results show a prediction accuracy of 76%.

Parraga-Alava et al. 2019 [26] present an approach to cat-
egorize potential suicide messages in social media, which is
based on unsupervised learning using traditional clustering
algorithms. The computational results showed that
Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (HCA) was the best model
J Med Syst (2020) 44: 205

for binary clustering achieving average rates of 79% and 87%
of Fl-score for English and Spanish.

Sawnhey et al. 2019 [53] investigate feature selection using
the Firefly algorithm to build an efficient and robust super-
vised approach for suicide risk detection using tweets. After
applying different ML techniques, RF +BFA and CNN-
LSTM obtained the best results in accuracy, precision, recall
and Fl-scores in specific datasets.

Shahreen et al. 2018 [54] used SVM and neural networks
(NN) for text classification on Twitter. The researchers used
three types of weight optimizers, namely Limited-memory
BFGS, Stochastic Gradient Descent and an extension of sto-
chastic gradient descent which is Adam to obtain maximum
accuracy. The results show an accuracy of 95.2% using SVM
and 97.6% using neural networks. They have used 10-fold
cross-validation for model performance evaluation.

Sun et al. 2019 [55] have proposed a hybrid model that
combines the convolutional neural network long short-term
memory (CNN-LSTM) with a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) method to identify user’s emotions, sample user’s
emotional transition and detect anomalies according to the
transition tensor. The results show that emotions can be well
sampled to conform to the user’s characteristics, and anomaly
can be detected using this model.

Zhang et al. 2014 [56] have used NPL methods and ML
models to estimate suicide probability based on linguistic fea-
tures. The experiments performed by the researchers indicate
that the LDA method finds topics that are related to suicide
probability and improve the performance of prediction. They
obtained the best Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of
11 with a linear regression at 1-32 scale.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of the results in the
following sections: study objectives, data collection, model
development process and this section show data pre-process-
ing, data preparation, sentiment analysis, dataset annotation,
ML techniques, platforms and internal validation. The distri-
bution of the included studies according to the year of publi-
cation are presented in Fig. 2.

Study objectives

Most of the included studies propose models to classify col-
lected text into suicide-related categories. Text classification is
the most common objective in the included studies (12/16,
75%) [26, 42-48, 51-54]. A score estimation of suicidal prob-
ability based on post content was proposed in one of the in-
cluded studies (1/16, 6,25%) [56].

Feature extraction and feature selection were identified as
main objectives in four different studies (4/16, 25%) [48, 50,
53, 56]. The remaining categories (Entity Recognition, Theme
Identification and Emotion Recognition) were identified only
in a study (1/16, 6.25%) [47, 49, 55]. In total, 4 of 16 studies
(25%) can be grouped in two categories, involving text clas-
sification (3/4) [47, 48, 53] or score estimation (1/4) [56].

Data collection

Different data sources were selected to perform data collection
for training and testing of the proposed models. In total, 13 out
of the 16 included studies (81.25%) used General social net-
works (GSNs) for data collection [26, 43-48, 50, 52-56]. The
most popular GSN used as the data source in the included
studies was Twitter (10/16, 62.5%), followed by forums or
microblogs (3/16, 18.75%). Other GSNs used were Weibo
(2/16, 12.5%), Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and Reddit
(1/16, 6.25%). Three studies used OHCs (18.75%), two of
them used suicide-related subreddit [42, 49], and the other
one used a Sina microblog [51].

Three studies have collected data from OHCs used all
posts/comments without defining inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Most of the remaining studies defined suicide-related key-
words or phrases to filter posts out (10/13, 76.92%) [43-48,
50, 52-54]. Zhang et al. [56], recruited potential participants,
and then, the selected participants’ posts in Weibo have even
used. Finally, two studies that used GSNs did not define
inclusion/exclusion criteria (2/13, 15.38%) [26, 55].

The data collection time spam must be reported in ML-
based studies as it is defined by the Luo et al.’s guidelines
[37]. However, seven of the included studies did not report
the time spam when data collection was performed (43.75%)
[42, 43, 45, 46, 54-56].

One of the included studies did not report the dataset size
(1/16, 6.25%) [54]. The dataset sizes were between 102 posts
(minimum) and 1,100,000 posts (maximum). Four out of the
remaining 15 studies have used sample sizes between 100 and
999 posts (26.67%) [26, 42-44] . Three of them used sample
sizes with more than 800 posts. Five studies reported dataset
sizes between 1000 and 5000 posts (33.33%) [45, 47, 50, 52,
53]. Finally, six studies used large dataset, including more
than 10,000 posts (40%).

The number of users/participants represented in those datasets
was only reported in three studies (18.75%). One of those three

g) Springer
205 Page 8 of 15

studies recruited 697 participants and then collected data from
their Weibo accounts [56]. The other two studies analyzed the
user’s data collected to report the number of unique users in-
volved in the study (V = 3873; N= 63,252) [48, 49].

Although using basic statistics to describe dataset is de-
fined as a relevant factor regarding the reliability of ML-
based studies in the health domain, as suggested by Luo
et al.’s guidelines [37]. However, three of the included studies
did not report any dataset description (3/14, 21.43%) [42, 54,
55].

Moreover, only three studies included information re-
garding ethical issues to collect and manage social media
data (3/16, 18.75%). Two of those studies obtained the
ethical approval from Ethics Committee: Liu et al. [51]
from the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of
Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science, and O’Dea
et al. [52] from the University of New South Wales
Human Research Ethics Committee and the CSIRO
Ethics Committee. The remaining study, conducted by
Ambalavan et al. [42], adhered to the guidelines defined
by Kraut et al. 2004 [57]. It is highlighted that Zhang
et al. [56] assessed participants’ suicide probability
using a standard scale and have collected personal data.
However, the information regarding ethical approval
was not reported in the article.

Table 1 presents the summary of the results found in terms
of the objectives of the study, data sources, ethical aspects,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, time span, number of posts,
part number and the description of the data of the papers
included in this work.

Model development process
Data pre-processing

Data pre-processing is a typical stage in the development
process of ML-based models. This stage includes several
techniques such as data cleaning, words removal (stop
word and punctuation), data transformation, and address-
ing challenges of outlier or missing values. The reported
information regarding data pre-processing is critical for
study reproducibility. Most of the included studies report-
ed information regarding the pre-processing stage (14/16,
87.5%) [26, 42, 44-50, 52-56]. Several of these studies
only reported vague information and did not include de-
tails on the specific techniques and tools used. However,
the inclusion of a (sub) section describing data pre-
processing is not mandatory. In total, 4 studies included
a section/subsection reporting information regarding pre-
processing. The remaining studies reported this informa-
tion in the text. Moreover, some studies presented this
information in a different part of the article.

Data preparation

The data mining techniques for feature extraction, feature de-
tection, or entity recognition used in the included studies are
summarized in Table 2. In total, 50% of the included studies
(8/16) report the use of data mining techniques for feature
extraction, feature detection or entity identification [26, 44,
46, 48, 49, 51, 53, 56]. The most common reported technique
was LIWC (4/8, 50%), followed by LDA, LSA, and
Word2vec (2/8, 25%). Moreover, NMF and PCA were used
only in one of the included studies (12.5%). In total, 3 out of 8
studies (37.5%) combined more than one of those techniques.

Sentiment analysis

Seven out of the 16 included studies include sentiment analy-
sis (43.75%). A sentiment ratio or polarity value was assigned
to words or features in these studies. Two of these studies used
SentiWordNet to obtain the sentiment value [43, 44]. Also,
two studies used the categories defined in LIWC as a
basis of sentiment value estimation [44, 56].
Furthermore, two studies used previously published lex-
icons to calculate it [46, 53]. Finally, two studies cal-
culated those values [50, 55], automatically.

Dataset annotation

Supervised learning techniques require labelled, coded, or an-
notated datasets to train and test the models. In total, 15 out of
the 16 included studies required annotated datasets. One of
those studies did not report how annotations were performed
(6.67%) [54]. Most of the studies followed a manual process
to annotate the training and test datasets, involving experts in
the codification process (10/15, 66.67%) [42—47, 50-53].
Some of these studies reported detailly how the annotation
process was performed. Two studies used existing annotated
corpus (13.33%) [26, 55]. In one study (6.67%), the authors
designed an algorithm to generate the labels automatically
[48]. Finally, a study recruited participants and assessed the
participant’s suicide probability using a standard scale, the
Suicide Probability Scale, and the model results were com-
pared to those obtained using the scale (6.67%) [56].

Machine learning techniques

In total, 15 different ML techniques were used to implement
the models proposed in the included studies: Supported
Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic
Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB),
K-means (Km), Deep Learning techniques (DL), Neuronal
Network (NN), Linear Regression (LiR), K-nearest neighbour
(KNN), Gradient Boost Machine (GBM), Rotational Forest
(RoF), Partitioning A M (PAM), Hierarchical Component

Platforms and internal validation

The platform or software tool used to implement the ML-
based models is identified by half of the included studies.
Python was the most used tool (6/8, 75%) [26, 42, 46, 49,
52, 54]. One of these studies combines Python and R [26].
Two out of the 8 studies used Weka software to develop the
proposed models [43, 44].

One of the included studies focus on topic identification,
and authors followed a manual analysis of topics proposed
using the models to estimate their validation [49]. Five of
the remaining included studies did not report information re-
garding internal validation strategy followed to assess the va-
lidity of the proposed models (33.33%) [26, 43, 48, 50, 55].
The 10-fold cross-validation was the most implemented strat-
egy in the included studies (8/10, 80%) [44-46, 51-54, 56].
One study followed a 70-30 proportion rule to split the dataset
in training and test datasets (10%) [42]. However, the
technique used to split the data is not reported. Other
study followed a 7-1-2 proportion to split the dataset
for classifier model validation and a manual selection
for classifier validation (10%) [47].

All studies reported the performance parameters used in the
validation process. Precision, recall and F-score are the most
used performance parameters (12/15, 80%). In total, 66,67%
(10/15) of the studies have used accuracy as a performance
value. Fodeh et al. [48] used specificity, sensitivity and area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
(6.67%). Zhang et al. [56] used RMSE value to validate their
estimation model.

Discussion

Social networks are an effective method to detect some be-
haviours. Moreover, they are particularly relevant to identify
subjects at suicide risk. The extensive use of social networks
leads the authors to investigate the current scenario
concerning suicide prevention. This is the primary motivation
of the presented research. This study verifies the trends and
results of applying ML algorithms and the methods used by
various researchers to address this critical situation. Indeed,
considering the COVID-19 pandemic, social networks are one
of the most used methods of communication. Therefore, it is
relevant to survey the main techniques, algorithms and models
applied to social networks to detect suicidal risk behaviours.
In total, 43,75% (7/16) of the studies does not provide the
time spam information concerning the experiments conduct-
ed. This is a relevant limitation, as proposed by Luo et al.’s
guidelines [37]. Moreover, 81,25% (13/16) does not specify
the number of participants involved. The anonymization of
the participant information should be justified. However, it
is possible to characterize the participants involved in the

g) Springer

J Med Syst (2020) 44: 205

studies and maintain their privacy at the same time. This 1n-
formation allows us to conclude that the quality of the reports
of suicide risk prediction models must be increased. The au-
thors must report relevant items to ensure reliability.

Furthermore, the details of the datasets used are not pre-
sented in 18,75% (3/16) of the analyzed literature. Although
the use of basic statistics to describe dataset is defined as a
relevant factor regarding the reliability of ML-based studies in
the health domain as proposed by Luo et al.’s guidelines [37].
The dataset description is of utmost importance since the ef-
ficiency of the specified results, and their future improvements
are closely connected with the sample size.

Furthermore, three studies did not report any dataset de-
scription (3/14, 21.43%) [42, 54, 55]. Consequently, it is crit-
ical to question what reasons can justify the inexistence of the
dataset description. Indeed, this can be related to confidential
concerns. However, it is essential to mention that with-
out the complete dataset information is not possible to
ensure the absence of bias or deficiencies in the infor-
mation used. Moreover, it is not possible to ensure the
reproduction of the experiments.

In total, 76.92% (10/13) of the studies defined suicide-
related keywords or phrases for text analysis. Furthermore,
text classification is the objective of 75% of the analyzed
studies. Consequently, this denotes a significant limitation
concerning the multiple forms of visual communication items
such as emoticons that are currently used. However, the rea-
son why most of the authors does not consider the visual
components in sentences is not clear. This can be related to
technical limitations of the used software tools.

Consequently, it is necessary to promote new research ac-
tivities to solve this critical limitation. The pre-processing data
stage is required to develop or replicate the ML-based model.
Therefore, most of the included studies indicated information
about the pre-processing stage (14/16, 87.5%) [26, 42, 44-50,
52-56]. Moreover, it should be noted the majority of the stud-
ies only present vague information regarding pre-processing
data methods and validation strategy. Pre-processing is an
essential aspect of detecting suicide risk using ML.
However, according to the results achieved, there is a signif-
icant limitation related to the unstandardized information of
each analyzed research.

Additionally, the authors note that most of the reviewed
papers do not present the data processing methods in detail.
Consequently, there is a significant limitation concerning the
real reason for this scenario. This can be related to methodo-
logical or practical difficulties. However, the question about
what motivates this trend still exists. Furthermore, there is no
justification for this scenario in the before-mentioned studies.
Therefore, future research on the subject should ensure the
detailed information about the pre-processing methods.

A specific annotated dataset for suicide risk on social media
is also a critical limitation. In total, 10 of the 15 papers (75%)
J Med Syst (2020) 44: 205

have performed manual annotation. However, it should be
noted that the peculiarities of the multiple languages used in
social networks can be a relevant limitation for data labelling
[38, 58]. The sentiment analysis has been performed in most
cases assigning the polarity to the words [59]. However, these
polarities could vary according to specific domains such as
suicide and considering the terminology used in social net-
works. Therefore, it is relevant to perform sentiment analysis
that encompass the linguistic entities as phrases [60].

Stakeholders have reported several ethical issues as critical
factors in the use of social media as a participatory health tool
[61]. In this sense, those relevant issues must also be ad-
dressed appropriately in ML research applied to the health
domain. Despite this relevance, ethics is not appropriately
discussed by authors in their reports. There is a lack of infor-
mation regarding ethical issues in the included studies. Only
three studies included information regarding ethical issues to
collect and treat social media data (3/16, 18.75%). However,
the doubt regarding the reasons that justify the inexistent eth-
ical agreements of the majority of the works still exist.
Consequently, a critical limitation is found regarding the eth-
ical concerns involved in the collection and analysis of this
sensitive type of data.

Two of those studies obtained an ethical approval from the
Ethics Committee ([42, 52]). However, ethical and privacy
concerns associated with the data gathering method are a con-
troversial practice. To justify its use, formal prospective stud-
ies analyzing if and how physician access to a patient’s social
media influences care should be performed [62].

Conclusion

This paper has presented a scoping review on the main tech-
niques, algorithms and models applied to social networks to
detect suicidal risk. In total, 75% of the included studies pro-
pose models to classify collected text into suicide-related cat-
egories. Text classification is the main objective of 75% of the
included studies. Furthermore, 50% of the included studies
(8/16) report explicitly the use of data mining techniques for
feature extraction, feature detection or entity identification.
The most commonly reported method was LIWC (4/8,
50%), followed by LDA, LSA, and Word2vec (2/8, 25%).
NMEF and PCA were used only in one of the included studies
(12.5%). In total, 3 out of 8 research papers (37.5%) combined
more than one of those techniques.

One the one hand, SVM was the most used technique being
implemented in 10 out of the 16 included studies (62.5%). On
the other hand, the second most used technique was DT (7/16,
43.75%), followed by LR (5/16, 31.25%) and RF (4/16, 25%).
The most used platform to implement the ML-based models is
Python (6/8, 75%).

Pagel30f15 205

Furthermore, all studies reported the performance parame-
ters used in the validation process. Precision, recall and F-
score were the most used performance parameters (12/15,
80%). In total, 10 out of 15 studies used accuracy as a perfor-
mance evaluation metric (66.67%). In summary, ML methods
for suicide risk detection and prevention are adjusted to each
region, supporting the current pandemic scenario towards en-
hanced public health and well-being.

Nevertheless, this scoping review has some limitations re-
lated to its primary objective. This paper only reviews studies
that focus on suicide risks. The papers have been selected
using a scoping review methodology in four research data-
bases and written in English. However, other research studies
can be available in different languages and databases.
Moreover, the authors are aware that are multiple algorithms
available bases on statistical assessment. Still, this review only
surveys articles that include ML methods to detect suicide risk
on social networks.

As future work, several activities can be conducted, such as
creating an annotated Corpus for various languages, develop-
ing new ML models, especially in other languages than
English. These activities aim to classify posts, estimate
suicide risk, analyze potential predictive parameters, op-
timize predictive parameters, and analyze topics consid-
ering the temporal component of user posts and specific
tools to analyze sentiment.
