1. INTRODUCTION

Owing to features such as zero carbon footprint, enormous energy generation potential, being
renewable and sustainable in nature, wind energy augurs well to be the most promising source of sustainable
energy with immense futuristic scope. The great extent of technological enhancement has seen multi Mega
Watt of energy being produced in a single wind turbine system from a mere few tens of kilowatts of power
being produced in 1980’s. Factors such as air density and wind velocity plays a vital role in harnessing
energy from wind and Numerous intelligent techniques based wind energy system have been presented in
literature[1].Owing to the wind speed’s stochastic nature ,the deterministic reliability prediction methods
which are conventionally used in Industrial application is not a viable option for wind turbine applications.
These algorithms despite being robust and intelligent as assumed by authors in [3] are used in applications
that allows only a minimum variation in wind speed and also requires a constant air density assumption
which the authors in [2] have assumed.

The model has various inherent advantages such as reduced simulation time, eliminates the negative
aspects associated with pulse width modulation switching and also reduces the thermal stress by employing
the controller tuning methodology. The paper presents an overall perspective of the SEPIC based wind
energy conversion system and gives an insight into the frame work of evaluation of the converters.

Distributed wind generation units like DFIG makes use of the positives in the converters and
the various modes of control being made use of at the point of common coupling for supporting the grid
with additional reactive power. The DG interconnection with the distribution network makes use of
IEEE 1547 standards and based on them, DGs need to have a constant PF close to unity at PCC and to
achieve it multiple switched capacitor bank support is required. [4]. Despite active voltage regulation is

prohibited by these standards to a certain extent, voltage regulation can be performed if there is a
consensus amongst DG owners and the utility providers [5]. The size of the DG will decide whether to
operate it in power factor control mode, voltage control mode or voltage regulation mode [6]. Of late
Power factor control mode is used for controlling the smaller units while voltage control mode suits the
larger DG units provided ,the power factor being maintained at unity PCC in terms of reducing the
THD value [7] in the power factor control mode by modeling it as a PQ bus with negative
current injections[8].

2. RESEARCH METHOD

Figure 1 shows the block diagram of wind energy system used. Generator is very difficult to connect
with grid directly, Converter is an interface between that two sections [9]. DFIG being a variable speed
generator possess a distinct advantage over the fixed speed generators with regards to its variable speed
capability. Reduced power conversion paves the way for reduced losses, improved efficiency, enhanced
power factor and in turn provides reactive power to the grid [10]. The necessity of a gearbox in order to
increase speed coupled with the wind turbine — generator combination is the basic draw back in the case of
DFIG while the PMSG in order to achieve direct drive control is machined with sufficient number of poles in
accordance with the requirement [11].

3. PROPOSED SYSTEM

In the proposed system converter performance has been enhanced by means of reducing their power
consumption, reduced switching and power losses [12]. Here the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) values
were reduced to the prescribed limit in terms of inserting the LC filter along with the required output. Both
the values of direct AC and converted AC have been compared and their THD values are calculated [13]. In
order to achieve lower voltage level with regards to the DC-DC converter the synchronous converter stands
out as a perfect option due to the lower conduction loss in the diode [14]. The soft switching technique is
employed in the high side MOSFET so that the switching losses are eliminated. In addition to that the
resonant secondary circuit is designed to avoid the switching losses [15]. This method as suggested above
accomplishes an efficient convertion by employing an advanced design technique and in this regard the
converter performance has been analyzed [16].

4. MODES OF OPERATION
4.1. Mode I: DC-AC converterd input

A power converter generally employed for conversion of electrical energys being an electrical or
electro mechanical device could be constructed as a simple transformer to convert the voltage of AC power
or it can also be made into a complex system [17]. This is the technical term which refers to a class of
electrical machine which is used in accomplishing the conversion from one frequency component of
alternating current in to another frequency component [18]. DC supply is converted in to AC by means of
rectification and then it is fed to the converter[19].Owing to the voltage step-up/step-down capability a
SEPIC Converter is used for the wind energy system as well as its un-inverted output(as distinguished by
conventional buck-boost converter)[20].Output Voltage has been obtained and its THD value also been
determined.Figure 2 displays the simulated DC-AC Converted input [21].

4.2. Mode II: Direct ac input

Electrical drives for direct drive renewable energy systems, but the most important process of high
frequency switching results in negative effects [22]. Here a rectifier is often included to convert the AC
power in the mains, galvanic isolation between the input and output modules of converter [23]. AC voltage is
directly fed to the converter section [24]. Here also output voltage has been obtained with their relevant THD
values. Figure 3 shows the simulation diagram of direct AC input [25]. In this mode, supply from wind
energy is directly fed to the converter to reduce the losses when used to apply the direct ac input [26].

Figure 6 shows the outpiut voltage waveform of the same case which is to be in the form of
sinusoidal signal,the harmonics contents are eliminated by means of providing filter in the output side,the
THD values are considerably reduced in the application of filter which is mentioned in the table.1.By means
of evaluating the converter performance the THD value can be concluded in to the permissible limit as well
as switching losses and heating effect can also be reduced in this performance configuration.

6. CONCLUSION

Converter has the ability to work form an supply voltage which is greater or less than the regulated
output voltage. Converter design which includes minimal active elements, a simple controller and relevant
waveforms which provide low noise operation. Harmonics in the power systems result in increased heating in
the equipment and conductors, thus resulting in misfiring of variable speed drives and torque variations in
motors. Total harmonics distortion is a complex and often confusing concept to understand. From the above
analysis it can be concluded that the converter performance has been enhanced as well as the total harmonic
distortion has been reduced to a considerable level. By means of reducing the THD value, the entire working
of converter with the wind energy input has been improved to a considerable level and this paper also proves
that the lower range of THD in Power systems paves the way for high power factor, low peak currents and
higher efficiency. Simulation results prove that the output voltage is controlled as per the requirements and it
changes by controlling the duty cycle.
