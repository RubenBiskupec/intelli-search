Abstract

Cities all around the world are observing increasing levels of urban freight activities owing to the growth of
internet shopping combined to the traditional distribution to shops, creating additional problems in terms of
congestions and environmental impacts. This study, developed within the European Project SUITS framework, aims
at showing how Local Authorities can effectively observe freight flows from the demand side. This led to the
design, implementation and testing of a spatial cluster analysis approach to understand which are the most

important loading/unloading parking spots in an urban setting by processing the GPS traces of a fleet of logistic
vehicles. Later field activities should focus on these important areas to maximize the efficiency of the survey. A
survey of retailers and shops in such areas to observe delivering activities is then proposed. The whole process,
namely the spatial analysis and the field survey, was then tested to the real case of an Italian city (Turin) to assess
the potentiality of the methods. The methodology proposed can give useful insights to Local Authorities on a way
of monitoring the freight distribution patterns at the more disaggregated individual loading/unloading area.

1 Introduction

In cities usually affected by critical traffic conditions,
high levels of urban freight activities may create add-
itional problems in terms of congestion and environ-
mental impacts [1]. In recent years, an increasing
amount of goods is observed travelling around to be de-
livered directly to individual consumers, instead of arriv-
ing in bulk to selected store locations [2]. Moreover,
retailers and shops themselves are leaning more and
more on express couriers for the deliveries of the goods
they are selling, mainly in the city center because of the
reduced stocking spaces characterizing their locations.
As a consequence, a larger number of vehicles travelling

around for such deliveries purposes sums to the already
rather great amount of traffic affecting congested road
network. Local Authorities (LAs), which are responsible
for city mobility and quality of life, plays a fundamental
role in facing these issues: this requires urban freight
transport being part of a city strategic management [3].
However, “the number of different definitions of urban
freight transport and city logistics reflects the complexity
of this field and the persistent lack of consensus on how
to address the issues” ([4], page 2). Moreover, the urban
freight transport planning process involves various as-
pects, as the monitoring of the freight activity, the un-
derstanding of the local supply chains, and _ the
stakeholders’ involvement. As observed in [3], there are
three main facets when dealing with urban freight trans-
port, namely the demand of goods and services, their de-
livery and the physical environment, regulated by local

government services. All these preliminary points high-
light the variety of aspects that worth to be treated while
dealing with this topic.

The point of view we would like to consider is the
Local Authority’s. It is as a key figure that is expected to
take into account the needs of different stakeholders in-
volved in the field while developing a proper strategy for
urban freight transport, through the collaboration with
all the actors involved. Looking at the European level,
the European Commission requires cities to define
urban freight plans in order to study measures to deal
with the efficiency of urban logistics, with the challen-
ging objective of reducing the related externalities of
greenhouse gas emissions and noise [5]. The policy mea-
sures proposed to improve sustainability at the city level
can commonly belong to three kinds: pricing initiatives,
licensing and regulation efforts, and parking and unload-
ing initiatives [6]. Many urban authorities have been
asked to focus on the efficiency and sustainability of
freight transport due to its economic importance over
the last decade. Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans
(SUMPs) are the key tool for European LAs in the plan-
ning, development and implementation of adequate
transportation management. These plans consider the
main features of sustainable transport and have to de-
vote specific actions in their logistic components in the
so-called Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan — SULP [3].
However, Local Authorities capabilities in planning
freight movements are often limited, at least compared
to the attention paid to passenger transport issues.

Acknowledging such gap, the EU CIVITAS initiative
(https://civitas.org) has taken many actions to help cities
in implementing measures to improve freight movement
and reduce the related negative impacts [4]. Within
CIVITAS, the SUITS project (Supporting Urban Inte-
grated Transport Systems: Transferable tools for author-
ities - http://www.suits-project.eu/) focuses, among
other things, on integrating urban mobility planning
practices of both freight and passengers and on showcas-
ing how the joint exploitation of mobility-related data
that are seldom jointly considered can lead to new
knowledge and better insights on the transport system
of an urban area, thus contributing to the definition of
more efficient and effective policy measures. Nine cities
are members of the SUITS consortium, namely Alba
Iulia (Romania), Coventry (UK), Erfurt (Germany), Kala-
maria (Greece), Palanga (Lithuania), Rome (Italy), Stutt-
gart (Germany), Turin (Italy) and Valencia (Spain).
Evaluations conducted during the earlier phases of the
project revealed that many of these cities need, in fact,
support in the implementation of measures related to
freight distribution and data analyses [7].

The importance of data collection as a step for the
analysis and the observation of freight movements at the

Page 2 of 14

city level is a priority of the H2020 Research Programme
[8]. However an absence of proper focus on data collec-
tion and modelling was observed, despite these are es-
sential stages in the planning and implementation of
solutions based on the real needs of operators and LAs
[8], even if different approaches have been proposed in
the literature. For instance, Nuzzolo et al. [2] investigate
the characteristics of freight demand in three different
European cities (Rome, Barcelona and Santander) com-
bining traffic counts of vehicles and interviews with ran-
domly selected retailers and truck drivers. The final aim
is to collect insights into the characteristics of commod-
ity flows per freight types, shipment size for freight and
transport service types. An establishment-based freight
survey is studied in [9], demonstrating that it can pro-
vide worthy information and data on urban freight flows
and operations. At the same time, this kind of investiga-
tion is usually characterized by a high investment re-
quest, a strict correlation to the recall of respondents
and a low insight on vehicle activity [10]. As discussed
in [11], urban freight data are essential to managing such
travel demand appropriately.

Once assessed the important role played by data in the
observation of urban freight transport, it is necessary to
focus on the approaches available for their collection. On
the whole, a variety of survey techniques has been com-
monly used in the last 50 years to deepen this knowledge,
as reviewed by Allen et al. [10]. Although traditional sur-
veys are the most popular methods, some limits arise and
ensuring the quality of data implies an increasing cost
both in time and money [12]. In the meanwhile, the possi-
bility of collecting detailed travel information has broad-
ened thanks to developments in Global Positioning
System (GPS) technology. In fact, the integration with
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows to easily de-
termine origins, destinations, travel times, distances,
routes and vehicle speeds at highly disaggregate levels of
spatial and temporal resolution [13]. At the same time,
GPS can also be used to record stops for loading, unload-
ing and parking [10]. The updated guidelines also recom-
mend the collection of this kind of data for developing
and implementing a SULP [11]. Obviously, as suggested in
the cited document, it is crucial to cooperate with stake-
holder and data owners trying to establish long-term
agreements to ensure proper data supply. The collection
of freight-related movements information can be too
costly for LAs, given their budgetary priorities. So, Muni-
cipalities are expected to reach some good agreements
with operators owing data proposing, for example, the dis-
closure of such datasets against area access permission
and operational licenses for the activities that constitute
main freight transport generators [11].

The general conclusion from the above short review
and discussion is that LAs are more and more

acknowledging the importance of proper management of
urban freight movements, but are not enough focusing
on related data issues nor exploiting the opportunities
related to passive data collection streams such as GPS
traces. The present study would like to fill some of the
knowledge missing at that level, since it focuses on the
development of a methodology that can help cities to in-
vestigate a specific aspect characterizing and influencing
their mobility, namely the observation of freight deliver-
ies from the demand side, i.e. through the observation of
the delivery points in urban areas.

This is hopefully achieved by proposing an innovative
approach that exploits GPS traces, firstly, to analyze the
places where a fleet of logistics vehicles is delivering or
picking up parcels. This dataset is then studied to iden-
tify which of these places are more relevant for the fleet
operations and therefore deserve additional investiga-
tion. Criteria to select such places based on both GPS
traces and additional considerations are discussed in the
paper. Indeed, such selection needs to be carefully done
in order to concentrate the survey efforts and maximize
efficiency. Finally, a vehicle observation survey is de-
signed to understand in-depth the demand for freight
transport in the selected loading and unloading areas,
which requires the presence on the field of technical
staff and that, therefore, could not be spread to all ser-
vice points of a city. The method to select a set of load-
ing/unloading points was applied on a dataset from real
operations in the city of Turin (Italy). In the final phase
of the research the survey instrument was tested into
one of those points.

2 Methods

The next sections will present the main steps of a meth-
odology developed to help municipalities to gain a better
knowledge of freight distribution patterns at the more
disaggregated individual loading/unloading area through
the exploitation of logistics vehicles GPS traces.

The proposed approach starts from the identification
of the locations where vehicles commonly stand for their
deliveries. Then, a specific clustering algorithm is ap-
plied to identify the zones with the largest number of
stops, which is one of the selection criteria to identify
the most important areas. The subsequent step inte-
grates the outcome of the algorithm by introducing four
aspects related to typical characteristics of the loading/
unloading spots and of the delivering means. Such cri-
teria along with the results of the clustering algorithm
are used to select a reduced number of areas (possibly
only one) where it is interesting to investigate the parcel
distribution in more detail. Finally, a specific survey is
proposed to collect information on freight patterns from
the demand side by focusing on retailers and shops in
the above-selected area. Data derived can help to

Page 3 of 14

understand the current exploitation of the loading/
unloading spots and the freights flow from the demand
side. The following subsections illustrate the above
method more in details.

2.1 Identification of vehicles stops

The first step in our approach requires the analysis of
vehicles travelling around the city to identify the loca-
tions of their deliveries. A possible way of achieving it is
through the analysis of GPS traces, a kind of data com-
monly exploited to track the vehicles at the urban level
or on long distances [12, 14—17].

On the whole, not so many papers deal with the ana-
lysis of stops that can be inferred from this kind of re-
cordings. Different approaches within such research
domain are proposed for freights travelling on long dis-
tances or for those moving in the urban context. Exam-
ples belonging to the former case are those of Aziz et al.,
who try to identify the functionality of truck stops on
highways from GPS data [18], and of Haque et al., who
aim at predicting truck parking utilization at rest areas
for parking management reasons [19]. At the city level,
instead, the evaluation of vehicles stops could be useful
to classify them according to their purpose (work or
non-work related) [20], for the optimization of the urban
freight transportation system [21], for evaluating delivery
performances (e.g. speeds, travel times, delivery times)
and fuel consumption and emissions [22] or for the
computation of practical indicators helping LAs to gain
insights into the urban transport activities [23]. In the
current work, GPS traces are instead analyzed to derive
two pieces of information: 1) the time that each vehicle
loses in congestion in each street that it travels through
and 2) the identification of the stops that are made to
pick up and deliver goods. The former analysis is not re-
ported here but it is presented in [24]: we directly make
use of related results in the following.

Concerning the latter point, we preliminarily notice
that a vehicle might not move due to different reasons,
including making deliveries but also stopping at cross-
ings to give way, at a red light or due to congestion.
Hence, it is necessary to distinguish service stops from
stops due to traffic conditions. Following the approach
proposed in [24], stops whose duration is shorter than
120s (2 min) are considered as due to traffic conditions,
because this is a typical maximum duration of a stop
caused by the red phase of a traffic light or for yielding.
Service stops are, instead, supposed to be normally lon-
ger than this threshold, as suggested in previous research
[13]. The selected value is assumed in fact as a good
compromise for the proper identification of service
stops, bearing in mind the existence of deliveries that
could be managed in less than 120s and the possibility
of being stuck in traffic for more than 2 min.
Diana et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:40

2.2 Selection of a subset of stops through spatial
clustering

The next step in the methodology requires the identifi-
cation of clusters of points among those available: in
such way, it is then possible to focus on the most im-
portant sites where the tracked vehicles usually stop in
order to implement the survey. In fact, it is clearly not
feasible to organize a field activity covering the whole
area, whereas on the other hand many stops are often
concentrated in given places. On the other hand, vehi-
cles are not always stopping at pre-defined locations but
in practice they usually stop all along the buzziest streets
to minimize distances that need to be covered on foot. It
is therefore difficult to decide exactly where to go to ad-
minister the survey. A spatial analysis of these stops po-
sitions is needed to find in which points one should
concentrate the field activity to maximize its efficiency.
Cluster analysis can help in this case, since it is a tech-
nique aiming at finding collections of objects such that
the elements in a group will be similar (or related) to
one another and different from (or unrelated to) the ele-
ments in other groups [25]. Examples of exploitation of
this data mining methodology can be found in different
domains of transport engineering such as transit quality
evaluation [26] or tours classification [27], while its use
in urban logistics can be exploited for the organization
of deliveries according to city’s characteristics [28] or
the optimization of freight transport system’s perfor-
mances [29].

Different clustering techniques are available according
to the kind of dataset that has to be analyzed. Since we
are working with geolocations, a suitable method is to
consider a density-based algorithm [30]. In this case, a
cluster is a dense region of points, which is separated
from other regions of high density by low-density areas.
The method is usually applied when clusters are irregu-
lar or intertwined, and when noise and outliers are
present [25]. In the current methodology, the application
of such procedure could help to remove the noise, i.e.
the areas where a low number of stops are found, and to
focus on the most important ones. This approach is
similar to the one proposed by Aziz et al. in [18], but in
the present work the target is a different kind of vehicles
(vans rather than trucks) and a different context (urban
level rather than highways).

DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applica-
tions with noise) is a density-based algorithm where
density represents the number of points within a speci-
fied radius (Eps) and a point is a core point if it has
more than a specified number of points (MinPts) within
Eps, so that these are points that are at the interior of a
cluster. A border point has fewer than MinPts within
Eps, but it is in the neighborhood of a core point. Finally,
a noise point is any point that is neither a core point nor

Page 4 of 14

a border point [25]. The approach used to identify the
cluster of stop positions is based on the following com-
putational steps:

1. Consider the positions (latitude and longitude) of
all the stops

2. Min-Max normalize to have uniform maximum and
minimum values [0-1]

3. Apply the DBSCAN algorithm to the dataset, with
Eps = 0.005 and MinPts = 5

The latter two parameters have been selected to reach a
good compromise between the minimum number of ele-
ments needed to create a cluster (MinPts) that corre-
sponds to the number of delivery stops found in a certain
site, and the distance (Eps) that could be approximately
assumed to be equal to 8 m.

The application of the clustering algorithm allows to
classify a certain number of stops positions as noise, i.e.
not assigned to a cluster, meaning that they are located
in sites not so commonly used for deliveries. At the
same time, the remaining elements define some clusters
that have to be investigated in more details to identify a
restricted set of clusters that contain a considerable
number of stops. A possible threshold could be set to
one delivery for each working day.

2.3 Additional selection criteria of the areas where the
survey should be run

The procedure presented so far produces a restricted
number of locations where a loading/unloading survey
can be implemented. However, additional selection cri-
teria for clusters can be evaluated, beyond the above-
considered minimum threshold in terms of the number
of service stops, in case the number of clusters is still
too high. With this aim, four additional qualitative and
quantitative aspects that could be relevant in different
policy-making contexts are introduced and discussed in
the following. All these are based on the expertise and
feedback obtained from SUITS partners, namely city
representatives on the one hand and researchers on the
other. These aspects and the related criteria to assign
ratings in terms of low, medium or high priority in
selecting an area to implement the field activity are as
follows:

e First aspect: the number of vehicles delivering in a
specific cluster, irrespective of the number of service
stops. This could correspond to a more frequently
used location that could provide interesting and
useful information during the survey data collection.
The mode of the distribution of the number of vans
stopping in an area is taken as a threshold and it
corresponds to a medium rating of the priority for
Diana et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:40

the roll-out of the survey, while higher numbers of
vans identify areas with higher priority and lower
numbers the opposite.

e Second aspect: congestion issues. The productivity
of vehicles, which can be directly measured through
the mean commercial speed of the tour, is
differently affected by congestion according to the
specific tour. By computing the key performance
indicator related to congestion presented in [24], the
focus goes on vehicles that wasted more time
because of congestion and that realized at least one
service stop within any of the obtained clusters: we
then consider the number of stops they make and
areas less frequently visited by these vehicles receive
a low rating, whereas areas with a higher number of
such stops have a medium or high rating. It is then
possible to understand which of the clusters is more
related to vehicles that have relatively lower
productivity, and for which it is therefore more
important to take some corrective action.

e Third aspect: street characteristics, such as access
restrictions. Areas situated within roads with
restricted access are less likely to be affected by
traffic flows and are therefore not considered as
priority areas for further investigation, earning low
ratings: examples are pedestrianized streets where
access is allowed to permit holders, as commonly
happens for logistics operators. Sometimes, these
permits include the possibility of travelling also
along roads that can only be accessed by public
transport in specific time ranges: a medium rating is
assigned in these cases. Finally, high ratings are
associated with areas where the logistics vehicles are
commonly sharing the space with ordinary traffic
flows for the majority of the time during the
working days.

e Fourth aspect: location of retail outlets. This kind of
dataset provides information on where the vans
need to stop for their deliveries. In fact, many shops
are nowadays supplied through parcels rather than
bulk shipments with trucks, especially in the city
center where the dimensions of the shops
themselves are smaller and they do not have enough
space for large stocks. To consider such aspect, high
ratings are given to areas with a higher number of
commercial activities in their proximity. Information
is accessible thanks to specific maps commonly
made available by municipalities, or can be found on
web mapping services.

The above criteria are used for a comparative analysis
of all the areas selected by the clustering algorithm, with
the final goal of selecting a furtherly reduced number of
zones where to run the survey.

2.4 Description of the on-site survey
The final step in the proposed approach includes the im-
plementation of a survey aimed at collecting information
on freight flows from the demand side by focusing on
retailers and shops in the above-selected area(s). Within
a specific observation period, all stop events are re-
corded. A stop event is specified as any vehicle (including
trucks, vans and cargo bikes) stopping within the bound-
aries of the area and from which parcels are either
unloaded or loaded, irrespective of the fact that such
parcels will either go inside or outside such area once
having left the vehicle or come from a location outside
or inside the area before getting on the vehicle. Within
each stop event, more than one deliveries or pickups epi-
sodes could take place, according to the number of final
destinations and origins of the parcels. The surveyor
separately records all these deliveries and pickups. For
example, during a stop event the operator could take
two parcels out of the vehicle at once, and drop them at
two different locations, while collecting a third parcel
from the second location that is finally loaded on the ve-
hicle. These three different episodes within the same
event are then separately recorded. On the other hand,
bulky deliveries might require more than one trip from
the vehicle to the final destination, and in this case only
a single delivery episode is recorded.

The following information is recorded for each stop
event:

Operator

Kind of vehicle: make & model
Fuel

Plate number

Exact stop location

Initial time of stop

Final time of stop,

whereas the following information is recorded for each
pickup and delivery episode within each stop:

e Number of packs delivered or collected
Approximated linear dimensions or volume
Means of delivery or collection (e.g. by hand, trolley,
pallet)

e Exact location of the destination of delivery or origin
of pickup.

The collected information can be further analyzed ac-
cording to the specific needs of the Local Authorities.
However, it is anticipated that the focus of this paper is
not to discuss a specific use of the data gathered through
the above survey, but rather to test both the loading area
selection process and the functionality of the survey in-
strument in a real case study. Here it is only noted that
Diana et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:40

useful insights into the delivering operations can be
achieved, both in terms of mode used (vehicles and final
means of delivery/collection) and in the timing of differ-
ent loading and unloading operations while the vehicle
is stopping. It is also possible to better know the exact
place where vehicles stop: the aim is to check if load/un-
load areas are properly exploited.

3 Case study and results

3.1 Test field and datasets

The method introduced in the previous section was
tested on a real case study in Turin, a city of about 883,
000 inhabitants located in the north-western part of Italy
and surrounded by a metropolitan area of about 2 mil-
lions inhabitants. Like most of the largest urban areas,
the central area is a “Limited Traffic Zone” (LTZ), hav-
ing a size of about 2 * 1.5km. The LTZ contains a large
proportion of mobility attractors, including shops, busi-
ness districts and public offices, and has a car access re-
stricted during the morning peak hour.

Both the Turin municipality and its in-house company
5 T, which manages the traffic control system and other
mobility services in the city and beyond, are partners of
SUITS project and provided the data that were used in
the present research. This dataset includes the traces, i.e.
GPS locations, of a fleet of 28 logistic vehicles serving
the central area of the city in a whole month period
(May 2017). These recordings are available thanks to a
special agreement between the City Council and the
haulage companies. According to such agreement, com-
panies’ vehicles have an easier access inside the LTZ
against the disclosure of such GPS traces. Although the
size of the sample seems quite small compared to traffic
flows in the city, it should be mentioned that these
tracked vehicles represent approximated 1/3 of all vehi-
cles that enter the LTZ and that they were monitored
for a quite long period. Therefore this sample can be
considered as representative of the operation of vehicles
in that area.

The dataset contains the following information: vehicle
ID, timestamp, the validity of the measure of the pos-
ition (yes/no), latitude and longitude which are recorded
every 10s, instantaneous speed and direction (course).
On the whole, a total number of 360,820 positions for
the 28 different vehicles registered in the month of May
2017 is available. Our analysis will focus on a specific
area of the city, namely the above mentioned Limited
Traffic Zone, and on weekdays (Monday to Friday, ex-
cluding holidays) within the observation period.

3.2 Identification of the vehicle stops

The first step was to process the previously introduced
dataset to gain information on the locations of stops.
This analysis requires to compute the overall time

Page 6 of 14

interval for a series of subsequent O speed recordings: if
it is larger than 2 min, a service stop is identified and its
location is reported as the average of all those positions.
Three thousand three hundred thirty-six stops were
found and linked to the vehicles delivering in the se-
lected area, with the original fleet size reducing from 28
to 19 since the remained did not deliver in the LTZ.

The locations of stops are represented in Fig. 1, where
each color represents a different vehicle. This picture
can already provide some insights into the delivering
patterns in the city center. For example, it is interesting
to note different vehicles serving different parts of the
LTZ, while they seem to make more or less the same
tour day after day. Moreover, a visual inspection allows
finding some spots where a lot of points overlap or ag-
gregate, whereas other stops seem to be more isolated. A
simple look at this figure clearly shows the need for a
loading areas selection procedure to identify a manage-
able number of areas where it is convenient to concen-
trate surveying activities.

On the whole, this dataset can provide some further
preliminary information. The service stops were done in
20 different weekdays of May 2017, mainly in the time
range 8am-7 pm. Moreover, it is possible to check the
number of stops done in a month by all the vehicles de-
livering in the LTZ (Fig. 2). Large differences are ob-
served, quantitatively confirming the visual results
observed in Fig. 1. More in details, Fig. 3a shows that
most of the deliveries are done from 10am to 4pm. This
information can also be exploited for a proper
organization of the on-site surveys, namely selecting a
time range that could be characterized by a considerable
number of delivering operations to be investigated. Fur-
ther preliminary analysis can focus on the duration of
stops (see Fig. 3b), which should be considered in de-
signing the survey so that it does not take too long to
gather all data. The large majority of vehicles seems to
manage the delivery operations in less than 10 min, with
the highest frequency of stops durations being included
in the 2—5 min range.

3.3 Selection of a subset of stops through spatial
clustering

Once some knowledge has been gained on the dataset
collecting the 3336 stops locations found in the Turin
LTZ, it is possible to apply the subsequent step of the
methodology proposed. DBSCAN algorithm is, in fact,
implemented and used to analyze the dataset through a
free and open-source data analytics, reporting and inte-
gration platform named KNIME, which integrates vari-
ous components for machine learning and data mining
[31]. After the application of the clustering algorithm,
1825 items among the 3336 positions are classified as
noise (55% of stops), ie. not linked to a cluster, meaning

that they are located in sites not so commonly used
for deliveries. At the same time, 140 clusters are de-
fined from the remaining 1511 elements. In order to
focus on clusters representing more intense activity,
we consider a set of 41 clusters out of 140 that con-
tain at least 10 stops, and then we narrow down such
sample to another set of nine clusters that contain at
least 20 stops. This latter set is made of 376 service
stops, i.e. more than 11% of the total, and thus repre-
sents a reasonable sample. Both sets are in the fol-
lowing Fig. 4, where the locations of the designated

loading/unloading areas are also represented. This lat-
ter dataset was provided by the Municipality of Turin
and consists in a GIS layer that collects all the 250
load/unload parking spots which are available within
the LTZ. The superimposition of the information de-
riving from the two datasets could inform on the fre-
quency of use of the available load/unload areas.
However, a detailed investigation, as the one available
through an on-site survey, is required to better
understand which could be the causes of low exploit-

3.4 Final selection of a stop where to run the survey

The nine areas obtained from the previous steps of the
methodology could represent a manageable number of
spots where a loading/unloading survey can be imple-
mented. However, for illustrative purposes we apply the
four additional criteria defined in section 2.3 through a
comparative analysis of those areas, with the final goal of
selecting one zone where to conduct the survey. Table 1
reports the results of the evaluation exercise on the nine
zones: each line collects the entity of the priority for the
survey roll-out, each column refers instead to one of the
four aspects. The ratings displayed in the table were dis-
cussed among experts in the SUITS consortium that
have a knowledge of both the concept under investiga-
tion and of the study area.

The second column labelled as “Number of vehicles”
deals with to the first of the four criteria described in
section 2.3: the mode of the distribution is equal to 8 in
the current case and the priority ratings are assigned
consequently.

The evaluation of the congestion issues is related to
the ratings of the third column of Table 1. The compu-
tation of the key performance indicator [24] allows iden-
tifying the vehicles that wasted more time because of
congestion and that visited at least one service stop
within any of the nine clusters. Three vehicles out of the
17 delivering in these areas were selected: the number of
stops they make is then considered and we give a low
rating to areas less frequently visited by these three vehi-
cles, whereas areas with a higher number of such stops
have a medium or high priority rating.

Some detailed knowledge of street characteristics has
to be collected to assign ratings reported in the fourth
column in Table 1. In Turin, the access to the LTZ is re-
stricted to the vehicles with special permission from
7.30am to 10.30am during a working day: we assign a
high priority rating to areas that are located here, being
the ones more influenced by ordinary traffic flows (Area
3 and 8). Many streets, instead, can only be accessed by

Page 9 of 14

public transport from 7am to 8pm, whereas others are
pedestrianized: in both cases, access is possible only to
permit holders, as logistic vehicles can commonly be.
On the whole, areas situated within roads with restricted
access are less likely to interfere with traffic flows and
were therefore classified with a low or medium priority
rating depending if they are located in pedestrian streets
(i.e. with reduced amount of traffic) or along roads with
public transport means travelling.

Finally, we evaluate the fourth criterion (last column
of Table 1) thanks to the open GIS data web site of the
Municipality of Turin (http://geoportale.comune.torino.
it/web/), where it is possible to access a map which con-
tains all the locations of commercial activities of the city.
In this case, we give high ratings to areas with a higher
number of commercial activities in their proximity.

Based on the qualitative and quantitative evaluation
results provided in Table 1, the selected area where the
load/unload survey is run is the number 8 which is lo-
cated in via Roma, between the crossings with via
Gramsci and via Buozzi (see the map of Fig. 4). This area
is characterized by the largest number of vans delivering
to it, who suffered from most delays. It also has a high
density of retail outlets and express couriers’ drivers
have to deal with ordinary traffic and other vehicles.
Most of the shops in the area sell clothes. Two desig-
nated loading/unloading parking spots are available in
this street section, one northbound and the other
southbound.

3.5 Survey implementation in the selected area and
discussion

The on-site survey has been tested in the designated
area for an entire working week, from Wednesday 12th
December 2018 to Tuesday 18th December 2018 (Satur-
day and Sunday excluded). Christmas time was selected
as the busiest time of the year for parcel deliveries. Five
people of the SUITS team took part in the investigation,
with two daily shifts, one going from 10am to 1 pm and

another one from 1 pm to 4pm. The preliminary scan of
GPS recordings presented in the previous section re-
vealed, in fact, that the vast majority of deliveries occur
in this timeframe.

Although the collected information cannot be consid-
ered as representative of the freight delivery operations
in the entire city nor can it be generalized in other ways,
it is nevertheless interesting to have a closer look at the
survey results in order to understand what could poten-
tially be learned. Overall, 36 different vehicles have been
found delivering in this area during the days of investiga-
tion, being them cargo vans or box trucks of various di-
mensions and fueling (mainly natural gas and diesel).
Eighty-nine different stop events (according to the defin-
ition in section 2.4) were recorded, ranging from 12 to
25 events in each of the 5 days. Their distribution over
the day is rather uniform, with an increase in the first
part of the morning, when the shops are starting the ac-
tivity, and in the middle of the afternoon (Fig. 5a). This
seems quite surprising, as traffic regulations and restric-
tions inside the LTZ are, as depicted previously, still de-
signed as if the majority of deliveries occurred early in
the morning. Figure 5b reveals the distribution of stop
events duration: the average stop duration is 7 min,
while their great majority (approximately 70%) lasts less
than 8 min. Nineteen out of the above mentioned thirty-
six vehicles belong to 6 different express couriers’ opera-
tors, which in turn made 63 stops out of 89.

The total number of delivery episodes was 123, but
also 28 pickups were recorded for an average of 1.7 epi-
sodes for each service stop. Figure 6 shows the number
of episodes per stop on the y-axis, where stops are or-
dered from earliest to latest, one bar for each stop. In
two cases a commercial vehicle stop has been registered
but no goods have been collected or delivered. It is in-
teresting to notice that it is not infrequent to combine
more than one delivery or pickup in one stop, despite

Page 10 of 14

the above discussed relatively low duration of stops. Also
pickup episodes are commonplace. It can therefore be
seen on the one hand that freight movements within a
city might also involve a non-negligible proportion of
“inverse logistics chain’, where the goods are moving
from consumers or retailers back to dealers or pro-
ducers. On the other, the small dimension of many de-
liveries allows not only the consolidation of several
service stops into one vehicle tour but also the consoli-
dation of some delivery episodes into one service stop.
This aspect of the logistic chain probably deserves more at-
tention, since different final destinations are reached on
foot from the location where the vehicle stops. Vehicles
understandably tend to stop as much near as possible to
the delivery address irrespective of the designated load/un-
load area, which are also sometimes occupied by private ve-
hicles. This reinforces the idea put forward in the current
research to do a spatial cluster analysis of geolocated service
stops in order to understand which are the best observation
points to run the survey. This can be a support for
decision-makers for a possible revision of the related pol-
icies, since the actual organization of service stops at least
in the considered area is not very effective. Planning for
them should consider the actual road space, traffic condi-
tions, density of delivery points of each area, rather than
judgmentally scattering them about the road network.
More disaggregated analyses considering the final des-
tinations of the deliveries were also performed. Out of
23 different shops, 10 received parcels on average more
than once a day. This figure is strikingly pointing out to
which extent logistic chains work just in time and shops
in the central area rely on an efficient delivery service to
meet the demand for goods, rather than on their stocks.
The number of different parcels for those shops ranged
from 1 to 47 for the entire week. An average number of
3.5 packages were brought to destination for each deliv-
ery episode and 5.8 packages were on average consigned

Fig. 6 Number of delivery and pickup episodes for each recorded stop

during each stop event. For each collection operation,
instead, we obtain an average number of packages gath-
ered equal to 2.1. 70% of all packages are delivered by
hand, even if sometimes they are rather large: the kind
of goods sold in those shops (mainly garments or acces-
sories) can be commonly found in bulky but relatively
light boxes.

Given the above-discussed fragmentation of opera-
tions, an analysis was run to check if parcels commonly
delivered by hand after a journey by van could rather be
carried using a cargo bike. Limitations on both volume
and weights are then to be considered. As stated in sec-
tion 2.4, the best guess of either the linear dimensions or
the volume of packages were recorded too, while it was
clearly not possible to gather information on weight
through simple visual observation. Even if some assump-
tions could be done by considering the volumetric
weight, a commonly used measure by logistics operators
[32], given the above-mentioned kind of goods the vol-
ume of packages seems the most limiting factor. We
found that 61% of recorded deliveries events correspond
to a total volume that can be numerically considered
smaller than a cargo bike container of 1601. Obviously,
the parcel size has to fit properly the container dimen-
sions. As depicted also during the data collection opera-
tions, cargo bikes are currently delivering in this test
site, but with a low daily frequency. Many studies in lit-
erature show that a good percentage of motorized trips
in European cities could be shifted to bikes or cargo
bikes [33], up to 51% according to [34]. These numbers
seem to be coherent with our findings. In general, Local
Authorities are increasing the promotion of this more

sustainable means, as currently happens in Turin. How-
ever, it is important a good cooperation between public
stakeholders and urban logistics operators [35]. Despite
the former aim at increasing the promotion of cargo
bikes, the latter are still skeptical, mainly due to oper-
ational issues (only cope with small parcels, short travel
distance, and availability of consolidation centers).

Although this survey is mainly designed to understand
freight demand patterns, it was also noted that the same
operator (possibly with different vehicles) delivered more
than once from 10am to 4pm and up to a maximum of
4 times in this site, which does not seem the ideal situ-
ation for efficiency but it is possibly due to scheduling
constraints that cannot be assessed through this kind of
survey. On the whole, this optimization process is up to
the logistics operators and it is out of the scope of our
analysis because LAs are not expected to have a say on
this directly.

4 Conclusions

The methodology presented, and the real case studied in
the city of Turin, have demonstrated how it is possible
to use the information of a dataset collecting logistics
vehicles GPS traces to effectively sample a manageable
number of loading/unloading areas in a city and to run
on the latter subset a freight loading/unloading survey.
As observed in section 2, works in the literature tend to
exploit such kind of dataset for different aims, mainly to
investigate the locations of the stops or the freight
movement. Instead, the current study tries to show the
potentiality of this type of information to practically
build the sample, given the fact that designated loading
Diana et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:40

areas are often not used and there is a high spatial dis-
persion of real service stops in the study area. A spatial
clustering analysis was proposed to overcome this issue
and it allowed selecting those areas where field observa-
tions can maximize the efficiency of the survey effort.
Having a good representative sample of all possible freight
areas is key to run a detailed investigation that is giving
the maximum information with minimal effort. This is a
well-known problem of all travel surveys that are ex-
tremely expensive and that have therefore to maximize
their efficiency. While professional practice in achieving
this in passenger surveys is well established, samples of
loading and unloading areas are sometimes selected on
less rational grounds, thus prejudicing the information
quality and insightfulness of the observed data, despite the
investment in the data collection activity.

The main interest of the method lies in the possibility
for LAs to have a better knowledge of freight distribu-
tion patterns at the more disaggregated individual load-
ing/unloading area. Although such information could be
theoretically obtained by asking the different operators,
it is highly unlikely that it would be fully disclosed due
to both data privacy concerns and commercial interests.
At the same time, interviews with retailers can be done
to collect information about the retail trade in the study
area [36]. However, both these approaches require to
rely on the cooperation of a sufficient number of re-
tailers and operators to gain an adequate amount of ele-
ments useful for the analysis. Given the fragmentation
and dynamisms of commodity flows where bulky ship-
ments to a single destination nearly filling one vehicle
are the exception, observing unloading parking spots
could be more effective.

The proposal of specific policy actions is out the intent
of the current work and would require additional inves-
tigations and debates with the Municipality; however, we
think that some potential exploitation of the current
methodology worth to be proposed. In fact, the survey
results can be used to inform a range of policy actions at
city level related to freight delivery, such as:

e understanding the effectiveness and impacts of
delivering operations in key areas of the city,

e assessing the already available unload/load parking
spots,

e understanding which actions the LAs should address
to ameliorate urban freights policies at specific
locations by looking at deliveries in a specific street
and at the retailers and shops exploitation of express
couriers’ services.

Some theoretical developments are probably sought in
order to better link the proposed empirical approach
with the statistical sampling theory and_ practice

regarding travel surveys and in particular the design of a
stratified sample, as commonly happens in Establishment-
based Freight Surveys [9]. More specifically, it is possible
to explicit consider those variables that were considered
to select the areas (area location, urban settings, number
of service stops ...) as stratifying variables in a stratified
sample design (as it is normally done with socioeconomic
characteristics to sample individuals in a household travel
survey). However, this would be really needed in practice
only in case the LA is willing to run the above-described
field survey on a substantial sample of, say, several dozens
of areas. If this is not the case, e.g. due to budget limita-
tions in running the survey or the research goals that are
very specific to a given area, our recommendation is to
run a spatial cluster analysis and then to judgmentally se-
lect the areas to investigate through an interactive process
between municipalities, other stakeholders and analysts, as
done in this application.

Concerning the survey contents, its design was influ-
enced by the kind of retail activity which is prevalent in
the selected area, namely clothing stores. Different infor-
mation should probably be gathered in case of different
logistic chains, such as groceries, pharmaceutical or
newspapers that are characterized by stricter spatial and
temporal boundaries that should be properly considered.

The proposed method can be extended (with some
adaptation) to any kind of travel survey where the statis-
tical sampling unit are not people but spatial entities,
and therefore the stratifying variables cannot be socio-
economic characteristics of the user but rather attributes
of such entities. Examples include screen-line or cordon
surveys where the number of passing points it too high
to be entirely surveyed, customer-focused mobility sur-
veys at shops or other attraction points, or even cluster-
based household surveys where the analyst desires first
to focus and select specific neighborhoods (e.g. those
most affected by congestion), before proceeding to build
a sample based on socioeconomic characteristics as it is
common practice.
