Abstract

The memristor has been regarded as a promising candidate for constructing a neuromorphic computing platform that
is capable of confronting the bottleneck of the traditional von Neumann architecture. Here, inspired by the working
mechanism of the G-protein-linked receptor of biological cells, a novel double-layer memristive device with reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets covered by chitosan (an ionic conductive polymer) as the channel material is
constructed. The protons in chitosan and the functional groups in rGO nanosheets imitate the functions of the ligands

and receptors of biological cells, respectively. Smooth changes in the response current depending on the historical
applied voltages are observed, offering a promising pathway toward biorealistic synaptic emulation. The memristive
behavior is mainly a result of the interaction between protons provided by chitosan and the defects and functional
groups in the rGO nanosheets. The channel current is due to the hopping of protons through functional groups and is
limited by the traps in the rGO nanosheets. The transition from short-term to long-term potentiation is achieved, and
learning-forgetting behaviors of the memristor mimicking those of the human brain are demonstrated. Overall, the

bioinspired memristor-type artificial synaptic device shows great potential in neuromorphic networks.

Introduction

Inspired by the massive parallelism, robust computa-
tion, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency of the human
brain, neuromorphic computing has attracted a tre-
mendous upsurge of research interest since synaptic
behaviors were mimicked by Mead in 1996 using a
floating-gate silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor transis-
tor’. The implementation of neural networks at the
software level with algorithms, such as Google’s Alpha Go
and IBM Watson, based on complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor technology requires a large amount of
resources’. In addition, the tremendous amount of data
processing between the memory and the central

processing unit with a conventional von Neumann
architecture limits the speed of current computer sys-
tems’. However, the human brain, containing ~10''
neurons and 10’ synapses, only consumes less than
20 W, making it more efficient than any other computing
system®. Therefore, a computing system that can poten-
tially emulate the neuromorphic network and overcome
the von Neumann bottleneck is critically required.
Memristors acting as a synapse unit, resembling their
biological counterpart in terms of structure, can emulate
several functions of the synaptic behaviors of the human
brain. In addition, memristor-based artificial synapses can
be used as basic building blocks to achieve large-scale
neural network parallelism.

Thus, a great amount of attention has been attracted
and much effort has been made to improve the perfor-
mance of memristors. Generally, memristors are a type of
two-terminal device with a layer of memristive material
sandwiched between metal electrodes in either a vertical
or planar structure. The working mechanism of the

devices is highly related to the selection of both mem-
ristive and electrode materials. Recently, binary metal
oxides, oxide perovskites, polymers, and 2D materials
have been widely used as memristive layers in the con-
struction of memristors” '*. Each category of material has
advantages in terms of the working mechanism and the
material properties, which is beneficial to applications in
specific areas with the suitable selection of the materials.
According to different working mechanisms, memristors
can be categorized into filament-type and barrier-type
devices®. With regard to filament-type memristors, the
conductance of the devices is controlled by the formation
and rupture of the filament. Undesired abrupt con-
ductance changes and cycle-to-cycle variation are
observed due to the random distribution of the filaments
in the insulator caused by the stochastic nature of ion
migration’. Different from filament-type memristors,
barrier-type memristors generally modulate the con-
ductance states by the defect effect, which can overcome
the electroforming randomness, ensuring reproducibility,
and device-to-device uniformity'*'”. In addition, a series
of continuous conductance states capable of emulating
biosynaptic functions can be modulated by external sti-
muli. Therefore, use of the barrier-type memristor is
considered a more suitable approach to emulate synaptic
behaviors.

Based on the above analysis, the design of memristive
devices, whose conductance states can be modulated by
the defect effect, is a strategy to emulate biorealistic
synaptic behaviors. In addition, the high efficiency of
information processing and transmission in biological
nervous systems provides an approach to designing
memristive devices with high performance based on the
metrics of biological systems. For example, a double-layer
memristive device can be conceived based on inspiration
from the working mechanism and structure of the G-
protein-linked receptors of biological cells'®’’, in which
neural signals are transmitted by ligands from the extra-
cellular environment in conjunction with receptors from
transmembrane proteins located in the cytomembrane. In
the designed device, mobile carriers provided by the top
layer are able to mimic the functions of the ligands from
the extracellular environment, while functional groups
and defects in the bottom layer can behave like the
receptors from transmembrane proteins. However, to the
best of our knowledge, emulation of synaptic behaviors
using this bioinspired working mechanism has not been
reported even though the use of various materials, such as
binary oxides, polymers, and perovskites, has been
attempted in the fabrication of memristive devices?'?'*””.

Herein, we designed and fabricated a double-layer
memristive device in which chitosan (CS), an abundant,
nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible polymer, was
selected as the top-layer material due to its electronic

insulation and proton conduction properties”’. The pro-
tons, hopping between the channel layers, behave like the
ligands of biological cells. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
nanosheets were used as the bottom-layer material, and
the functional groups and defects in the nanosheets
behave like the receptors of biological cells. The number
of functional groups and defects in the rGO nanosheets
can be well controlled by tuning the degree of the che-
mical redox reaction”’””. As a result, the device exhibits
history-dependent memristive behaviors with continuous
changes in the conductance states, meeting the funda-
mental requirements for mimicking the functions of a
biological synapse. Consequently, a series of synaptic
characteristics, including short-term potentiation (STP),
long-term potentiation (LTP), spike-rate-dependent
plasticity (SRDP), and learning-forgetting behaviors,
toward biorealistic synaptic emulation were successfully
realized.

Results and discussion
Device structure and properties

Figure la shows the schematic diagrams for two neu-
rons connected by a synapse in the nervous system and
the corresponding working mechanism. Transmission of
synaptic signals between neurons is a complex process
that starts with the opening of voltage-controlled ion
channels by external stimuli’. In brief, the diffusion of
Ca’* ions leads to the release of neurotransmitters from
synaptic vesicles, and the ions bind to the receptor sites of
Na*-gated ion channels at postsynaptic neurons. As a
result, the Na‘ -gated ion channels will open, and Na™ can
diffuse inside the cell, which leads to a positively charged
membrane potential. The neuron will fire an action
potential once the membrane potential reaches the
threshold. This process contributes to the information
flow and signal processing of the nervous system’. Based
on the structure and types of receptors (acceptors), the
synapses in the biological system can be classified into
various categories. Taking the G-protein-linked receptor
as an example, the ligands from the extracellular envir-
onment react with the receptors from transmembrane
proteins located in the cytomembrane (circled by the red
dashed lines in Fig. 1a-II), and an ionic channel is formed
to transmit the signals. Inspired by the working principle
of the G-protein-linked receptor, a double-layer mem-
ristive device consisting of rGO and CS as bottom-layer
and top-layer materials, respectively, was fabricated, as
shown in Fig. 1b. In the designed memristive device, the
protons in CS and the functional groups in rGO are able
to imitate the functions of the ligands and receptors of
biological cells, respectively. Thus, the synaptic behavior
can be mimicked using this device by monitoring the
conductance change of the memristor. The detailed fab-
rication process and related parameters are included in

neuromorphic functions of the brain, a matrix of the

the optical image is presented in Fig. 1c. After fabrication
of the devices, the current-voltage (IV) characteristics of
the devices with rGO, CS, and rGO covered with CS as
the channel materials were investigated, as presented in
Fig. 1d, e, f, respectively. No hysteresis in the IV curves is
observed for the devices with rGO or CS as the channel
material, and the conductance is independent of the
applied voltage. Regarding the device with rGO/CS as the
channel material, a hysteretic IV characteristic is
obtained, which is a main feature of memristive devices.
The results imply the occurrence of an interaction
between the CS membrane and rGO nanosheets, which
leads to the change in device conductance being

 

dependent on the applied voltages. In addition, the bend
test shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 indicates the flex-
ibility and mechanical reliability of the devices.

Physical and electrical characteristics

To explore the underlying mechanism of the mem-
ristive behaviors of the device, the physical and electrical
properties of the rGO nanosheets, the CS membrane and
the interactions between them were investigated in
detail. From the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
in Fig. 2a—d, there are many nanoholes in the rGO
nanosheets, with an average size of ~1 um, which lead to
a number of defects (more information about the size
and thickness of the nanosheets is presented in Supple-
mentary Figs. S5 and S6). In this research, since the
channel length of the fabricated device is 40 um and the

size of the rGO nanosheets is ~1 um, it can be inferred
that there are a number of homojunctions caused by
overlaps of the nanosheets and intersecting grain
boundaries in the channel. The homojunctions and grain
boundaries as well as the defects inside the rGO
nanosheets work as traps and impede the flow of current
through the channel. By contrast, from the XPS spectra
shown in Supplementary Fig. $7, a considerable number
of functional groups are observed in the rGO nanosh-
eets, which will contribute to the current induced by the
hopping of the carriers in the channel*?~*’. In addition,
from the comparison of the FTIR spectra for CS and
rGO/CS in Fig. 2e, obvious changes in the bands at

 

1628-1633cm~* and 1524-1529cm™' are observed;
these bands are assigned to amide I and antisymmetric
—NH** deformation and to amide II and -N—H bending
vibrations, respectively’®. Thus, the changes are con-
sidered to be caused by the protonation of amide, which
is also supported by the N 1s peaks of the XPS spectra
shown in Fig. 2f, indicating that the extent of protona-
tion of amine groups increases from 2.96 to 14.25%. No
obvious change in the C 1s peaks is observed for the XPS
spectra collected from the CS and CS/rGO samples, as
shown in Supplementary Fig. $8. Furthermore, the
increased conductance of the devices with humidity
(Supplementary Fig. S9) is additional evidence for the
Lu et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:84

above analysis, as the extent of protonated amino groups
of CS is influenced by the ambient humidity”””*®.

Based on the above results, it can be inferred that the
current in the channel is caused by the hopping of protons
through the functional groups’’”'. The hopping process
resembles the interaction between the ligands and
receptors in biological systems. In other words, the for-
mation of current based on ionic dynamics in the mem-
ristor is similar to the working mechanism of G-protein-
linked receptors. In contrast, traps formed by the grain
boundaries, homojunctions, and defects will capture the
carriers and impede the current, as mentioned above’.
From the slopes of the IV curve in regions I and II of
Fig. 2g, as the voltage increases, the current changes from
the low-exponent space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
affected by shallow traps to the high-exponent SCLC
affected by deep traps. More injected carriers will fill the
trapping sites in order of the deeper energy levels, as
indicated in region III, with the further increase in voltage,
which leads to the dramatic increase in conductance’”’.
Because holes are the main carriers in this device, their
injection, transport, and trapping processes are analyzed
to provide a possible explanation for the underlying
mechanism. The CS membrane serves as a proton reser-
voir, and the current is formed due to the hopping of
protons through the functional groups in the channel.
However, the traps in the rGO nanosheets acting as
barriers will impede the current, and therefore, the
resistance is relatively large in region I of the forward IV
characteristic, as shown in Fig. 2g. As the voltage
increases, protons captured at the trapping sites diminish
the existing trap concentration gradually in the order of
the energy levels, and the resistance decreases, which is
supported by the increasing slopes of the fitting curves in
regions II and III of Fig. 2g°**°. Thus, the modulation of
conductance can be achieved as a function of the trapped
carrier concentration. As a result, the conductance
increases continuously depending on the history of
operation, indicating the typical memristive property. In
the reverse trace, protons in the shallow traps are released
as the voltage decreases. However, protons trapped in the
deep trapping energy sites cannot escape easily. Thus, a
more conductive channel is obtained than that forward
sweeping due to the unreleased carriers in the trapping
sites. As a sequence, an obvious hysteretic loop is gener-
ated, as illustrated in Fig. 2f. In the reverse IV curves,
another linear relation is fitted on the log scale, as shown
in region I of Fig. 2h, which correlates with the lower-
exponent SCLC. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
physical mechanisms for memristive behaviors are mainly
attributed to the SCLC transition caused by the charge
trapping/detrapping process with different filling ratios of
protons in the trapping sites of the rGO nanosheets as a
function of the operation history.

Working mechanism of the artificial synapse

Based on the above discussion, a schematic diagram for
the working mechanism of the memristor is demonstrated
in Fig. 3a, and a corresponding model is proposed. The
hopping process of protons through functional groups is
similar to the interaction of ligands and receptors in
biological cells, as indicated in the right corner of Fig. 3a.
Protons from the CS membrane act as ligands from the
extracellular environment, while the functional groups in
the rGO nanosheets behave like the receptors from
transmembrane proteins. The current induced by the
hopping of protons in the device channel mimics the
transmission of neuron signals. The band gap of the rGO
nanosheets is estimated to be 3.5eV from the UV-vis
absorption spectra (Supplementary Fig. $10). Initially, it is
tentatively hypothesized that the traps impede the carriers
in the channel due to the barrier heights*”°°*”. Thus, the
memristor is modeled as a number of face-to-face diodes
with a resistor between them, as shown in Fig. 3b. When a
positive voltage is applied to the left terminal of the
device, as presented in Fig. 3c, hopping of the protons
through the functional groups occurs under the external
electric field. A portion of the injected protons is captured
by the trapping sites. With increasing applied voltage, the
traps are gradually filled in the order of the energy levels.
Then, the barrier heights (or the number of diodes in the
proposed model) gradually decrease, as indicated in
Fig. 3c, which leads to a decrease in the impedance.
Therefore, the slope of the channel current is enhanced
due to the decreased impedance. As a result, the forward
trace labeled 1 in Fig. 3f is obtained. In the reverse sweep,
the carriers trapped in the deep energy levels cannot be
thoroughly released with decreasing applied voltage,
which indicates that a portion of the traps are always filled
and that the diminished barrier height cannot be recov-
ered to the initial states. Thus, the reverse trace labeled 2
in Fig. 3f with a current larger than the forward trace is
achieved. The same working principle is also applicable to
the case of a negative sweep of the IV curves, as shown in
Fig. 3d.

Synaptic behaviors of the artificial synapse

After understanding the underlying mechanism of the
memristor, a possible electronic artificial synapse that
can imitate the behaviors of biological synapses is
demonstrated. Compared with a biological synapse, the
two electrodes of the fabricated device are analogous to
the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. The synaptic
strength, or synaptic plasticity, in biological systems,
which is believed to be a result of the number of neu-
rotransmitters released at the synapse, is determined by
presynaptic Ca*~ flux induced by an action potential**”*’.
Thus, a temporal change in synaptic strength can be
achieved as a function of the stimuli. Similarly, the

proposed model consisting of a number of face-to-face diodes for the memristor working in zero bias, forward bias, and reverse bias conditions,
respectively

synaptic weight of an artificial synapse, which is defined
by the conductance of the memristor, can be modulated
by the successive stimuli of external applied pulses.
Therefore, first, the plasticity characteristics of the arti-
ficial synapse by 100 consecutive pulses with an ampli-
tude of 2 V and pulse widths of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 ms
were investigated, as presented in Fig. 4a. In the case of
100 successive stimuli with a pulse width smaller than
5 ms, no obvious increase in the response current, that is,
synaptic potentiation, is observed. With increasing pulse
width, an enhancement in synaptic potentiation is
obtained. However, when the pulse width is larger than
50 ms, some fluctuations in the response current occur.
This phenomenon is probably attributed to different
facilitation ratios caused by the variations in relaxation
time for each stimulus, which is dependent on the con-
ductance mechanism, when the device is stimulated by

 

pulse trains with a pulse width larger than 50 ms‘.
Therefore, a pulse width of 30 ms is selected to investi-
gate other synaptic behaviors. The SRDP was examined
by varying the frequency and amplitude of the pulses.
For consecutive pulses with an amplitude of 2 V and a
width of 30ms, there is almost no increase in the
response current at a given frequency of 1.1 Hz. How-
ever, when the frequency increases to 9 Hz, the current
increase rate is larger than that of previous conditions
with lower frequencies, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. This
behavior is related to the competition between the
relaxation time of the artificial synapse and the interval
between two pulses. When the amplitude of pulses
increases from 1 to 2V, the current increase rate
becomes even larger, as illustrated in Fig. 4c, which
corresponds to the filling of traps with higher energy
levels, as discussed above.

Emulation of learning and forgetting process

If the external stimuli are removed after the potentia-
tion of artificial synapses, the conductance will decay to its
initial low value, dependent on the number of applied
pulses. If the conductance decays to its initial value
rapidly (within several seconds), it is termed STP*. The
process is related to the release of trapped carriers in the
trapping sites, and the relaxation follows the exponential
law with time described by the equation below*™!:

I = (Ip — Ie) exp | (y" 4 In (1)

where ¢ is the relaxation time, T is the time constant, Jp is
the initial current level, /.. is the current level at infinite
time, and f is the stretch index, with a value between
O and 1.

In this research, an STP behavior with a relaxation time
constant of 10.5 is achieved after 100 consecutive pulses
with an amplitude of 2 V and a pulse width of 30 ms, as

 

shown in Fig. 5a. The STP is replicated in Supplementary
Fig. $11 of the Supplementary materials, indicating the
stability of the artificial synapse. In addition, STP can be
trained into a permanent change in the conductance state
called LTP. In electronic devices, the transition from STP
to LTP is monitored by the decrease in conductance
during the decay time. As shown in Fig. 5b, the con-
ductance is maintained at a higher value than the initial
state for a long time (more than 10 min) after the removal
of the applied pulses, when the pulse width of stimuli
increases to 500ms. This phenomenon represents the
transition from STP to LTP.

In biological systems, as the Ebbinghaus forgetting
curve describes in the early period, information is lost
quickly when it is initially learned, and the rate at which
these memories are lost is dependent on the frequency the
information is reviewed**. In addition, the multistore
model of human memory proposed by Richard C.
Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1958 states that new
information coming from outside the environment will be

Fig. 5 Emulation of learning and forgetting process with the designed artificial synapse. a, b show the STP and LTP behavior of the artificial
synapse. A demonstration of STM and LTM of the artificial synapses by putting letters “LH” and “X” into the matrix is presented in (c) and (d)

selected as short-term memory (STM) and long-term
memory (LTM). Both studies indicate that the retention
of the memory level is dependent on the training times
and similar to the transition from STP to LTP in mem-
ristive devices demonstrated in this research*’. Therefore,
the artificial synapse developed in this study, capable of

 

mimicking both STP and LTP and its transition process,
has the potential for the realization of STM and LTM and,
in turn, the construction of a neuromorphic network. To
prove the ability of STM and LTM emulation, a simula-
tion was implemented by inputting the letters “LH” and
“X” into the memristor matrix, as shown in Fig. 5c. “LH”
Lu et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:84

was stimulated by 100 consecutive pulses with an ampli-
tude of 2V and a pulse width of 30 ms, and “X” was
trained with the same number of pulses but for a longer
pulse width of 500 ms. Both “LX” and “X” were gradually
memorized by the devices with increasing spike number,
which represented the dynamic learning process. After
learning 100 times, the applied stimuli were removed, and
the forgetting process was investigated. For the devices
stimulated by the pulses with a shorter pulse width, that
is, 30 ms, the forgetting process was faster than that with a
pulse width of 500 ms, and therefore, the “LX” was almost
completely forgotten in 10s, which was consistent with
the relaxation time shown in Fig. 5a. Regarding the
devices trained by pulses with a longer pulse width of
500 ms, the letter “X” can be memorized for more than
10min, which can be considered LTM. The above
demonstration indicates that basic learning and forgetting
behaviors, which are performed by a complex neural net-
work in the human brain, can be successfully emulated
using the memristor matrix**. In addition, the continuous
conductance states of the device modulated by the pulse
stimuli provide a solid foundation for implementing the
neural network at the hardware level. All the results imply
that memristor-based artificial synapses can be regarded as
building blocks of artificial neural networks, representing
an essential step toward neuromorphic applications.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a bioinspired double-layered memristor
matrix was fabricated with rGO nanosheets prepared by
chemical redox reactions and natural CS biopolymers.
Distinct from previously reported memristors, the mem-
ristive device developed in this research is inspired by the
working principle of the G-protein-linked receptors of
biological cells, and the underlying mechanism is based on
the interaction between rGO and CS. Studies on the phy-
sical and electrical properties of the devices and materials
prove that the memristive behavior is due to the interaction
between protons provided by CS and the defects and
functional groups in the rGO nanosheets. Learning-
forgetting processes based on the STP and LTP proper-
ties of the devices were demonstrated, which showed great
potential in emulating the functions of the human brain.
Overall, artificial synapses offer a new avenue for the con-
struction of neuromorphic computation systems based on
devices with bionic structures and working mechanisms.

ammonia solution (28 wt% in water, Sinopharm, China)
and 4uL hydrazine solution (35 wt% in water, Wuxi
Zhanwang, China) for chemical reduction of GO. The
weight ratio of hydrazine to GO was ~6:10. After fully
mixing, the flask was immersed into an oil bath at 90°C
for 1h with magnetic stirring and cyclic cooling water.
After complete reaction in the flask, an rGO dispersion
was obtained, which was used as the precursor for
channel materials of memristors without any further
treatment.

Fabrication of the memristors on flexible substrates

A diluted polyimide (PI) solution was spin-coated on
cleaned glass and cured at 300 °C for 1h. Then, electrodes
(Ti/Au) were deposited by sputtering and patterned using
a photolithograph and lift-off method on the PI sub-
strates. Next, an aqueous rGO dispersion was drop-cast
on the sample, and the active regions were defined using
photolithography and O, plasma etching. To reduce the
contact resistance between the electrodes and rGO
nanosheets, the sample was annealed at 150°C for 90 min
in ambient argon. Both IV characteristics of the device
before and after annealing and the isolation between
devices are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S2. After-
ward, the 2% CS solution (5 pL) was dropped on top of the
active regions. Finally, the PI film was peeled off from the
glass. The detailed fabrication process is demonstrated in
Supplementary Fig. $1 of the Supplemental materials.

Device characterizations

The size and surface morphology of rGO nanosheets
were investigated by AFM (Bruker Dimension, USA) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi Regulus,
Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The thickness of
the rGO nanosheets could also be determined from the
AFM results. FTIR spectra were collected via a Thermo
Nicolet iN 10 spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher, USA) with the
laser operating at 77 K in a liquid nitrogen environment.
XPS analysis was carried out using a Thermo Scientific
EXCALAB 250 XI system (Thermo-Fisher, USA). Raman
spectra of the materials were collected using a Horiba-JY
Labram HR system (HORIBA JY, France). A Perkin Elmer
Lambda 25 spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) was used to
investigate the absorbance of rGO nanosheets. All the
electrical measurements were performed at 25°C and 40%
humidity using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor para-
meter analyzer (Keysight, USA).
