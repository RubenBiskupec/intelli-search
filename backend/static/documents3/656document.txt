Non financial compensation cs

for the redevelopment of the historic urban
landscape: the case study of Villasor in Sardinia

(Italy)

Abstract

In Europe, the debate on the recovery of the historic centres has been developed, over the years, around the balance
between conservation and transformation needs in order to meet the new demands of the contemporary world. In
the field of urban planning, the strictly conservative and binding approach has gradually been supported by flexible
and consensual mechanisms that act as a stimulus to private initiative in the redevelooment and regeneration of the
historic urban landscape. The consolidated Italian experience in the policies for the protection and enhancement of
historical settlements is being significantly innovated after the entry into force of the Urbani Code, which extends
the character of landscape heritage to the historic urban fabric, transferring to the regional authorities the task of
establishing the specific regulations for its use and transformation. The Region of Sardinia has achieved an important
role in the implementation of policies for the recovery and redevelopment of the historic centres identified by the
Regional Landscape Plan (RLP). The common and consolidated practice is still characterized by the use of traditional
regulative instruments, in particular the detailed plan, which provide rules for the requalification of the compromised
urban fabrics through a set of rules and guidelines to be applied to the replacement of recent buildings and the
renovation of urban patterns that for density, ratios between solids and voids, heights, alignments and elevations are
incompatible with the values of the context. The constraint and binding approach is effective in the conservation
strategies but often inadequate to implement actions of integrated redevelopment of urban fabric altered by new
buildings in contrast with the historic urban landscape features, also due to the global crisis situation and the short-
age of public funding. The paper proposes the use of the non-financial compensation tool, based on the granting of
bonus development rights to realising on site or in alternative locations, in order to encourage urban regeneration
projects that also involve the replacement of buildings incompatible with historical urban landscape morphological
patterns. The integration of a methodology for assessing the financial feasibility of the demolition and reconstruction
of the incompatible structures in the planning process, as tested in the case study of Villasor municipality, has allowed
the elaboration of a model to support the use of a compensation mechanism for the redevelopment of historical set-
tlement values. In this perspective, the paper aims to investigate the opportunities provided by market-oriented and
flexible approaches to support and promote private urban regeneration projects. In particular, it illustrates the experi-
mental results of a methodology for the analysis of the urban fabric that takes into account the factors influencing the
feasibility of the intervention of demolition and reconstruction of the incompatible buildings. Finally a model for the

Introduction

In the second half of the Nineteenth century, the rapid
urban growth and the real estate speculation have com-
promised the historical parts of European cities. In Italy,
since the 1960s, a greater awareness of the uniqueness
and value of ancient sites fostered the evolution of the
normative and technical framework according to the
need to extend the protection from the single monu-
mental building towards the urban scale that includes
parts of complex and stratified fabric, without a particu-
larly relevant historical value (Bonfantini 2012; Clementi
1990; Colavitti 2018; Giambruno 2007; Wallach 2000).
The Italian culture on the urban renovation, as clearly
expressed by the Gubbio Charter and promoted by the
National Association of Historical and Artistic Centers
(ANCSA), has influenced the role of local plans in the
physical preservation of the urban environment, involv-
ing cultural and social factors in a process of continu-
ity and changes (Bandarin and Van Oers 2012; Rodwell
2007). The research of a universality of approaches and
practices has failed due to the complexity of each settle-
ment and to the changeable nature over time of the his-
toric urban landscape, that need a constant update of the
planning choices according to the uncertain political and
socio-economic conditions (Angiuli 2015; Gabrielli and
Gastaldi 2004).

During the seventies, the historic center has acquired
a new value as an economic resource, both in terms of
financial and social use, which cannot be reconciled with
a strictly conservative approach based on the total pres-
ervation of historical-artistic features without evaluat-
ing its effects on the socio-economic context (Cervellati
1991; Mazzoleni 1991; Tallon 2010). The 1975 Charter
of Amsterdam encourages an integrated conservation
approach, combining architectural restoration tech-
niques with the preservation and enhancement of the
environmental specificities and the local identity (Aris-
tone and Palazzo 2000).

In fact, urban recovery has often overlooked the social
and economic factors, focusing on the morphological
issues, thus neglecting any strategies for the reintroduc-
tion of the historical heritage into the real estate market
(Savino 2005). Strict conservative constraints, even in
case of a low value built heritage, have often led to aban-
donment and degradation, violation of rules and ille-
gal construction. Moreover, they have negative impacts
on the permanence of manufacturing and commercial

activities and lead to processes of gentrification and
modification of urban structures (Indovina and Savino
1997; Semi and Tonetta 2020).

The policies for historical centers are mainly based on
the use of the Recovery Plan, a detailed plan that defines
the admissible interventions and methods for the con-
servation, recovery and reconstruction of the existing
buildings, according to the assessment of historical and
architectural values (Karrer et al. 1998).

The landscape planning season, introduced by the
Urbani Code (D.Lgs. N.42/2004), emphasized the role of
participatory and consensual activities in the definition
of “landscape quality objectives” in the municipal urban
planning, by implementing recovery and redevelop-
ment interventions in areas that have been significantly
affected or degraded as well as by adopting criteria for
the correct integration of new developments in the his-
torical urban landscape.

In the Sardinia Region, that has a long tradition in the
recovery of the historic centres, the innovations on the
national scene and the adoption of the Regional Land-
scape Plan in 2006 (Sardinia Region 2013) have not gen-
erated changes in the municipal planning instruments
used to implement strategies for the redevelopment of
historic sites. The detailed plan is still characterized by
a strong analytical component, aimed at the recogni-
tion of widespread historical and cultural values, and by
a framework of conservation and transformation actions
that is often defined without an adequate assessment of
the financial feasibility and sustainability. Such opera-
tions often involve the requalification of settlements that
have been particularly compromised by recent buildings
for which replacement and reconstruction in a compat-
ible way are expected. Such measures usually find limited
agreement from the owners of buildings legally devel-
oped in compliance with the urban plans in force and
then declared by the detailed plan as incompatible. The
plan purpose, which leads to a substantial economic loss
to the owner, cannot be realized without fiscal benefits,
government grants or rewards that would result in rea-
sonable profitability. For this reason the research investi-
gates the opportunity to apply a market based approach
to support this kind of urban regeneration practices. The
paper illustrates the results of the research applied to the
case study of the municipality of Villasor, in the Prov-
ince of South Sardinia, through the experimentation of a
methodology of analysis and a model for the incentives

assessment, to be integrated in the Detailed Plan for the
recovery of the historic centre. The case study selection
resulted in a medium-sized municipality, characterized
by a low-density urban pattern with large unbuilt areas
that increase the opportunities for the redistribution and
transfer of development rights. The research is part of the
drafting of the detailed plan for the recovery of the his-
toric center, which was carried out by the University of
Cagliari in cooperation with the municipality of Villasor.’

The municipal initiative to adopt a detailed plan derives
from the strict restrictions imposed by the RLP on the
construction activity in the historic centres. Without
such an instrument, only ordinary and extraordinary
maintenance, restoration, conservation and _ internal
intervention are allowed (art.52, RLP). The plan pro-
vides a detailed identification and classification of exist-
ing buildings based on the age of the construction, the
traditional and historic character and the impact on the
context (in the case of recent buildings). It also assigns a
judgement of historic and landscape value which reflects
different degrees of transformability and specific rules
for the intervention and focuses on the buildings that are
classified by the plan as “new typologically incompatible’,
for which actions to mitigate the negative impacts on the
landscape are foreseen, where possible. Sometimes it is
necessary to completely replace them, according to forms
that are coherent with the historical urban pattern and
compatible in terms of architectural features, heights and
position in the lot. The incompatibility with the historic
urban landscape is often due to the building size, which is
not easy to solve without a reduction in volume, height or
sometimes spatial relocation.

The study aims to provide a theoretical model for
the assessment of the factors used for quantifying the
rewarding development capacity required to ensure the
cost-effectiveness of the redevelopment strategies.

Non-financial compensation as a tool for urban
regeneration

In the international context, the use of the so-called
“non-financial compensation” is widespread, due to
the progressive reduction in the available public funds.
It is used by local authorities in place of other regula-
tory measures to compensate property owners for some
constraints or to encourage the realization of the plan
proposals (Colavitti and Serra 2017; Serra 2018; Janssen-
Jansen et al. 2008; Spaans et al. 2010).

of the University of Cagliari for the drafting of the Detailed Plan for the recov-
ery of the Historic Centre of Villasor.

Non financial compensation is traditionally employed
for the public acquisition of land, as an alternative to the
compulsory purchase. Nowadays it is applied to a wide
range of situations in which the public body intended
to compensate an owner, for the loss of opportunities or
constraint, and opted for additional development capac-
ity instead of monetary compensation (Linkous 2016).

In several European countries (Germany, the Neth-
erlands, Spain, France and Italy) and international ones
(United States, Japan, Turkey, etc.) the experimentation
of innovative market-oriented mechanisms has started,
either in alternative or to support traditional regulatory
and authoritative methods. They are based on public—
private cooperation and on the concept of transferable
and sometimes marketable development rights (Micelli
2011; Serra 2018; Nelson et al. 2012; Thorsnes and
Simons 1999; Kocalar 2012).

In the legal comparison of the different Transfer of
Development Rights (TDR) experimental contexts, the
substantial differences between United States and Euro-
pean Union law should be taken into account. Although
both pursue the protection of private property and the
prohibition of public purchase without adequate com-
pensation, the role of the Supreme Court of the United
States of America in the defence of these rights is
stronger than that of the EU Court of Justice, to which
the single citizen is not able to refer directly (Ziller 2015).

The level of experimentation of market based tools is
directly linked to the different views of property law in
the national states. In the European countries that have
been influenced by Roman law (e.g. Germany, Spain, the
Netherlands and France), the right to the ownership of
land is considered as absolute and indivisible. Therefore
the potential for future development is a benefit that the
landowner acquires on taking possession of land (Booth
2008). In the US context, the Anglo-Saxon concept of
property ownership is embodied in a “bundle of rights’,
with a clear separation of the right to build (Renard
2007). Also in the UK, the transfer of the ownership
rights is partial and rarely definitive, resulting in a set of
fragmented rights, rather than an unbundled portion of
a comprehensive right. The ownership of development
rights belongs to the state, which can impose restrictions
through the land use plan, without any compensation
(Nadin and Stead 2014; Nadin et al. 1997). Although in
Europe the opportunity to development of land is allo-
cated by the plan and considered indivisible from the
ownership, the current political debate focuses on the
idea of increasing the autonomy of the development right
with respect to the ownership of land.

The main difference with traditional monetary com-
pensation is that the administration does not compen-
sate owners in financial terms for the loss of value. On
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

the contrary, it grants them the right to develop a certain
amount of building volume, which can be sold, used on
site or transferred to another area suitable for building
development, which then results in a financial value (Van
der Veen et al. 2010).

In the United States, the broad and well-established
experience of the so-called Transfer of Development
Rights Programs (TDR) has inspired several applications
in Europe. The owners of sending areas, which are sub-
ject to restrictions on building construction, can transfer
the assigned development rights to the receiving areas,
defined by the plan suitable for urban development. An
example is the TDR program used to compensate for the
financial losses caused by the restrictions on the monu-
mental heritage in the city of New York, part of the 1968
Zoning Resolution, which allows to sell or transfer the
so-called air rights of land subjected to constraints to
be developed in neighboring properties (Machemer and
Kaplowitz 2002).

The TDR methods have evolved over time: from a
basic Zoning Lot Merger, in use since 1916, which con-
sists of the simple union of two contiguous lots and the
TDR within the sector (Benn and Infranca 2013), to more
complex mechanisms such as the Landmark Transfer, a
special permit for the sale of unused development rights,
granted to the owners of monumental and _ historical
buildings, also allowing a further transfer of the develop-
ment capacity (Tomlan 2015).

In the city of Denver (Colorado), TDRs have been used
since 1982 to compensate owners who voluntarily pro-
pose the inclusion of their building in the list of histori-
cal and cultural heritage to be preserved. On the same
way is the 1985 plan of the city of San Francisco (Cali-
fornia), which identified in the urban center 253 proper-
ties defined as “architecturally significant’, subjected to
compulsory conservation constraints, and another 183
properties classified as “contributory buildings’, because
of their architectural, historical and cultural value. The
owners of contributory buildings, who voluntarily choose
to keep them unchanged, can benefit from incentives
in terms of transferable development rights, by subject-
ing the historic building under an integral conservation
measure (Nelson et al. 2012). TDR programs have usu-
ally supported environmental protection policies and
originally played a marginal role in the field of conserva-
tion and preservation of the built heritage, an issue that
has been generally neglected by studies (Chan and Hou
2015).

Interesting suggestions for the redevelopment of his-
torical fabrics are also offered by the TDR programs
which, in pursuit of environmental protection goals, pro-
mote the demolition of existing incompatible buildings
in natural and protected areas. Such is the case of TDR

program for Lake Tahoe, whose area includes 207.000
acres of land under the administrative control of sev-
eral counties in California and Nevada, in addition to
the city of South Lake Tahoe. It is a program designed
to safeguard the Stream Environmental Zones and other
environmentally sensitive areas by transferring unused
development rights and removing existing structures
located in unsuitable areas. The incentive consists in the
allocation of transferable development rights, subject to
approval by the local government and the Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency.

In the instance of compensation for the demolition
of the existing structures, the associated area must be
returned to the natural conditions and made perma-
nently unbuilt. Demolition may involve different kinds of
buildings, from housing to accommodation, commercial
or public services (Nelson et al. 2012). The program cre-
ates a local market for development rights that can also
be transferred between different administrative jurisdic-
tions, according to the needs of future development of
each community. The program is often the only way to
obtain the development capacity useful to carry out con-
struction initiatives in the receiving areas, through the
support of a TDR bank that helps the interaction between
the supply and the demand of development rights in the
market (Pruetz and Standridge 2009).

In Europe, the TDR pilot projects, although in an
experimental stage, have been aimed at capturing the
surplus value generated by planning choices, in the inter-
est of the community, in a perspective of distributive
justice and containment of anthropic pressure on the
environmental and natural system (Spaans et al. 2011).

An example of European experience of market-ori-
ented approaches and non-financial compensation meas-
ures is the Space to Space program in the Netherlands,
in the province of Noord-Brabant, which aims to finance,
through the TDR, the demolition of agricultural or dis-
used buildings to achieve a high quality level of urban
and rural space (Janssen-Jansen 2008).

Proposed by the provincial authority and then approved
by the national government, the project involved several
financial operators in the creation of a kind of develop-
ment rights bank (TDR bank) to manage the whole oper-
ation, to be realized either autonomously or through the
constitution of a partnership. The receiving areas, desig-
nated for the use of the assigned development rights, are
not previously identified. They are then proposed by the
private investor and approved by the municipality, fol-
lowing specific requirements. They can be located in the
existing built-up area, on the edge of the urban district or
in rural areas specifically designated by the plan.

Also in Italy the use of TDR has been observed in
urban planning practice for decades, although only in
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

2011 a legislative act adopted by the national government
legitimized the procedures for the transfer of develop-
ment rights prescribing the transcription of the related
agreements. The option of increasing the development
capacity, within the framework of the urban planning
regulations, for actions aimed at the realization of social
housing, urban and building renovation, improvement
of the environmental quality of the settlements, already
emerges in the Financial Law of 2008, while today sev-
eral regional laws have introduced mechanisms for the
implementation of the urban plan based on a more or
less broad circulation of development rights on the ter-
ritory. In this direction, it is possible to create a real mar-
ket for development rights, on a municipal or supra-local
scale, in any case geographically limited to the territory
on which the authority has jurisdiction in urban planning
(Ziller 2015).

The transfer of development rights between differ-
ent territorial areas requires the use of corrective meas-
ures in line with the differences in real estate quotations
between sending and receiving areas, particularly if they
are not predefined by the plan (Torre et al. 2011).

Recently, such public—private trading schemes have
also been proposed for objectives directly related to
the regeneration of historic centres in some regions of
Italy, including Umbria,” compensating owners for the
costs paid for the recovery of public and private historic
heritage by granting development rights bonus to be
developed outside the perimeter of the historic centre
(Lazzarotti 2010).

The non financial compensation is evaluated on the
basis of the project cost, reduced for a minimum of 30%.
It represents an economic bonus, properly balanced in
the municipal plan according to factors such as the size of
the historic centre, the land use, the parking facilities and
the real estate prices (Falco 2012). The Veneto Region
also recognizes a construction credit for the demolition
of incongruous structures, the elimination of the ele-
ments of degradation, the improvement of urban, land-
scape, architectural and environmental quality.°

Materials and methods

The database used for the research is made up of the
information processed within the Detailed plan of Vil-
lasor to analyse the type-morphological structure of the
urban environment through the identification and analy-
sis of all buildings. The knowledge and project framework
of the plan has been managed through a Geographic

Information System (GIS), which allows to analyse the
relevant data, to produce qualitative and quantitative
surveys on the condition of the urban fabric and to elabo-
rate future projections on the hypotheses of proposed
requalification.

The methodology that has been adopted is based on a
set of indicators and criteria that, thanks to a high degree
of knowledge and awareness of the historical identity of
the places, allows to express a common and shared value
of incongruities of the recent buildings in the historical
landscape examined.

In general, buildings that create imbalances with the
surrounding and the global landscape are considered
incompatible. These imbalances are shown in the irreg-
ular skyline, in the shape and chromatic contrast, in the
loss of places identity, in the alteration of the type and
size characteristics, in the formal inadequacy, in the den-
sity disproportion and in the lack of harmony with the
context (Villari 2013).

The paper illustrates the results of the research applied
to the case study. In particular, a simplified model has
been developed for the evaluation of the financial fea-
sibility of the proposals for building redevelopment or
demolition and reconstruction, with or without a reduc-
tion in the building capacity.

The detailed assessment of the cost-effectiveness of
each project and the option of granting development
rights bonus to guarantee its realisation, properly deter-
mined for each property in the drafting of the plan,
would be difficult for the planner and would probably
lead to inequalities in the treatment of private property.
Consequently, it is necessary to develop simplified mod-
els of evaluation which, placed at the bottom of the plan-
ning process, will allow to structure, in principle, a set
of redevelopment actions that can be implemented and
contribute to the achievement of the desired level of
landscape quality.

The studied proposal involves the integration of a
methodology for the quantification of development
rights rewards for the replacement of incongruous build-
ings, with the GIS support.

The model for the assessment of development capacity,
already codified in a previous work (Colavitti and Serra
2017), is based on the premise that the conditions of con-
venience of building replacement are linked to the devel-
opment index attributed to an area, to the ratio between
the value of existing and new buildings and to the inci-
dence of the area, which reflects the location qualities of
the property and leads to higher profitability conditions
in demolition and reconstruction projects (Micelli 2014).

The model introduces some necessary simplifications,
by considering that the conditions of the context allow
for a coherent redistribution of the demolished volumes
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

within the same lot, in order to guarantee a landscape-
compatible solution, even with a bonus increase in the
development capacity assigned. Consequently, the for-
mula overlooks the impact of the area in estimating the
development capacity necessary to ensure the economic
profitability of the intervention and assumes that the
value of the new building is equal to or higher than the
existing one and, at the same time, compensates costs of
demolition and reconstruction, technical costs, conces-
sion charges, overheads, financial charges and business
profit inclusive of taxes and duties:

Vmp > Vmg + Kdg + Kep + S87 +0c+SG+Or+P

where Vmp: market value of the new building; Vme: mar-
ket value of the existing property; Kdz: demolishing costs
of the existing property; Kcp: construction costs of the
new building; S7: technical costs; Oc: licensors charges;
Sg: overheads; Of: financial expenses; P: profit before
taxes.

In order to assess the economic feasibility of demoli-
tion and reconstruction projects, as well as the cost of
the new constructions, additional factors must be taken
into account, including the cost of demolition of the
existing building,* the technical costs of project design
and management of the works, licensing fees, overheads
and any financial charges and profits. These factors are
quantified in this study as 25% of the construction cost
although, in the real market, they may significantly affect
the outcomes of the operation and require a more exten-
sive assessment than the one proposed, which may differ
from the empirical experience.

The process is characterized by a variable complexity
depending on the size of the intervention, on the possi-
ble transfer of the development rights outside the histori-
cal centre, on the time necessary for the project design,
authorization and realization. This factors could have
also a considerable effect on the fees and interest charges
linked to the project financing.

The simplified appraisal of the value of the exist-
ing building, using a merit point procedure (D’agostino
2008), is based on the application of a depreciation coef-
ficient, relating to the age and state of conservation of the
building, to the market price of the new construction.

The development capacity will be the result of an
increase in the existing volume with a premium coeffi-
cient p such as to guarantee the feasibility of the project:

 

* The total cost of demolition of buildings with reinforced concrete and brick-
work structure is estimated at EUR 28.85 per cubic metre in 2009 (Regional
price list for public works, available at https://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/57

The standard cost for the construction of new pub-
lic residential buildings, established by the Region of
Sardinia, is 906.48 euros per square meter.’ The assess-
ment of the depreciation coefficient is a key part of the
appraisal of the value of the existing building based on
the market price of new constructions. In this paper a
set of coefficients, related to the data on the state of con-
servation and maintenance of the buildings identified in
the detailed plan of Villasor, is adopted. However, this is
an aspect that requires special attention in the planning
practice and in the development of further theoretical
reflections. For the purpose of the methodology, several
tables included in some legislative acts have been taken
into account, such as the directive of the Ministry of Pub-
lic Works of 1949 and the Fair Rent Law n.392/1978, in
addition to some formulas conventionally used in the
estimation practice and in the handbooks (Cipollotti
2013).

Table 1 shows the criteria used to convert the rating
of the state of conservation and maintenance of the real
estate assets into a depreciation factor b that allows the
value per square metre of a hypothetical new building
to be compared to the specific conditions of the existing
building. In particular, it applies:

b=1 in the case of buildings of recent construction
and in a very good state of maintenance

b=0.8 for buildings in good state of conservation,
usually realized in the last 20 years;

 

> Resolution of the Sardinia Region Department of Public Works 2014.
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

b=0.6 for buildings in a medium state of conserva-
tion, which can be inhabited although they require
some maintenance works;

b=0.4 for buildings that are obsolescent and require
restoration.

b=0.2 for buildings in a state of ruin.

For what concerns the value per unit of new buildings,
on which the appraisal is based, no specific quotations are
provided by the Italian Revenue Agency (Agenzia delle
Entrate) because the amount of purchases and sales is
not sufficient to allow an estimate to be made. Reference
is therefore made to the quotations relating to the zone
“Central area and historic centre” in the first semester of
2019, which register a maximum value of civil houses in
a standard state of conservation of 950 Euro per square
meter. The properties traded on the market, to which
the quotation refers, are mainly linked to the category of
residential buildings in medium conservation state. It is
therefore considered that the price of new buildings can
probably be quantified with an increase of 30% of this
value, i.e. 1200 Euros per square metre.

The historic centres in the Sardinian landscape
planning

The 2006 Regional Landscape Plan (RLP) of Sardinia
puts under protection the areas characterized by his-
torical settlements, i.e. the development patterns of the
historic centres that can be identified from the historical
cartography (Art.51, RLP). The boundaries of the his-
toric centres are defined by the Region and checked by
the municipality through an in-depth survey of the fac-
tors that testify the “historicity” of the urban fabric and
the road network (Colavitti and Serra 2013). The RLP
establishes rules and specific guidelines to include in
the updating of municipal urban plans, before which
only interventions of maintenance and conservation are
allowed. The adoption of a detailed plan is a requirement
for the realization of building and urban transformations.
The drafting of the plan includes a detailed survey of
the environmental, physical, social and cultural features
of the historical settlement, in particular the buildings
characteristics, the state of conservation of the historical
heritage, the critical issues in progress and the emerging
problems of recovery and reuse.

The key principle of the RLP is the innovative approach
to the transformation of the historical fabric, according
to the current use, with respect for the priority of the
context values and the identity of the buildings, even in
the case of minor constructions, often affected by degra-
dation, damage or alteration. In this way, the restrictive
view of the historical centre as the storage of a range of
identity values to be protected is overcome, sometimes

neglecting the process of continuous modification of
the historical fabric to adapt to changeable and mutable
social and economic demands.

The main objective of the regional and municipal
planning tools is the preservation of the historical strat-
ification of the settlement, in order to allow the interpre-
tation of the evolutionary steps of the urban fabric and
the enhancement of the distinctive features of each his-
toric centre, including the margins between the adjacent
centres.

The widespread changes in the historic fabric, result-
ing from some recent interventions of new developments
or building renovations, often makes it difficult to recog-
nize the historic and identity features, the typological and
structural characteristics of the building, the layout of
lots and blocks. In this direction, renovation is promoted
in the search for the original urban pattern, also through
the replacement of incongruous and incompatible parts
(art.53, RLP).

The Sardinia Region is particularly interested in the
policies for the redevelopment of the historic settle-
ments, aimed at restoring high levels of landscape value
to the environmental, historical and cultural context also
through the reduction or mitigation of negative impacts
generated by the presence of incongruous buildings and
works, with no aesthetic value and not integrated into
the context, resulting in a loss of identity and quality of
places.

The traditional approach is characterized by the use
of detailed plans for the recovery of historical centres,
in which a comprehensive analysis of the urban fabric is
carried out, the levels of transformability are defined and
redevelopment projects are proposed by replacing the
incongruous buildings that act as landscape destroyers in
the historical urban fabric.

The detailed urban plan has the task of establishing a
set of regulations to promote the conservation of the
residual identity elements and the reconfiguration of
the damaged fabric, through building and urban renova-
tion that are coherent and compatible in terms of den-
sity, ratios between the solids and the voids, heights,
alignments and elevations with the historical landscape
context.

New development projects may be planned only in the
case of limited addition of new buildings to complete the
existing urban fabric, as well as in the case of lots histori-
cally unbuilt or affected by the progressive deterioration
of the existing buildings. It is possible to demolish, with
or without reconstruction, existing buildings regularly
authorized but considered incompatible with the tradi-
tional character of the historical environment (art.52,
RLP). Any reconstruction may take place within the
same lot or on a different location. The detailed planning
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

of historic centres have often failed due to the lack of a
strategic vision, the static nature of the regulations and
the low profitability and convenience of the investment,
which have oriented the private operators towards areas
external to the old centre (Wallach 2000).

The structure and the methodology used to draw up
the detailed plans are characterized by a strong analytical
component to support a strictly conservative approach,
which results in a highly prescriptive regulatory frame-
work that restricts the transformation of the urban fabric
also in the parts without historical and cultural elements
to be preserved.

The detailed plan is ineffective on the imposition of
conservation constraints on the surviving historical
heritage, but shows unsatisfactory performance in the
achievement of redevelopment objectives for the com-
promised settlements.

The past experience shows very few cases in which the
private owners are willing to carry out demolition and
reconstruction work of incompatible buildings, given the
lack of economic advantages and the voluntary nature
of the operation when they are legitimately built. Any
approach taken by the planner conflicts with the own-
ers low agreement. An excessively impositive and rigid
approach can paradoxically lead to the maintenance of
the status quo and also discourage ordinary maintenance,
which results in a deterioration of the building condi-
tions. The feasibility of the planned redevelopment pro-
jects is directly linked to the real economic advantage for
the private owner, which is reflected in his consent.

The recognition of a financial incentive, that could
encourage the initiatives, clashes with the difficult eco-
nomic conditions of the local authorities. It may be
replaced by a volume bonus, consisting in the allocation
of development rights, as compensation for economic
losses resulting from the intervention, to be used on site
or transferable.

At the moment, the recognition of the incompatibil-
ity of an existing building is a priority in urban planning
practice, without any assessment of the real possibility of
carrying out measures to mitigate the impacts or elimi-
nate such environmental negative effects. On the con-
trary, national and regional legislation allows the increase
in building volume, through an exception, even in cases
where the incompatibility is due to an excessive size of
the construction, giving less importance to the urban
scale than to the building one (Colavitti and Serra 2017).

In fact, for the redevelopment of the existing build-
ing stock, the Sardinia Region has adopted the national
directives by granting development rights incentives,
up to 30%, to be used on site for upgrading, extension,
demolition and reconstruction of existing buildings (with
Regional Law no. 4 of 2009). Such rewards have been

Page 8 of 15

confirmed by Regional Law no. 8 of 2015, which intro-
duces further incentives for the transfer of existing vol-
umes from areas with high landscape and environmental
value or hydrogeological risk.

The city council, also upon direct request of the pri-
vate investor, can grant a bonus up to 40% of the existing
building by identifying a suitable location, even within
the same zone A (historic centre), if allowed by the urban
plan in force.

A symptomatic case study: the historic centre

of Villasor (Sardinia, Italy)

The historic centre of Villasor covers an area of about
26.33 hectares, including about 3.83 hectares of streets
and squares. The development of the settlement has
been historically conditioned by the relationship with
the watercourse, that represented a primary resource for
water supply and, at the same time, a natural boundary to
the expansion of the urban fabric.

The Municipal Urban Plan identifies 46 blocks, within
the perimeter of the matrix centre (extensive historic
centre), that fall within different homogeneous zones:
zone A (restricted historic centre) for 7.55 hectares;
zones BO (Residential completion and restructuring) and
B1 (residential internal completion), characterized by a
compact urban pattern and immediately close to the old
city centre for 14.33 hectares; zones G3 and S (services)
for 0.61 hectares.

The composition of the built-up area and the road net-
work of the historic centre is the result of the integra-
tion of the basic building units along the main roads and
around the civil and religious hubs, according to addi-
tive criteria (Baldacci 1952; Le Lannou 1979; Sanna and
Atzeni 2009).

The block is the elementary part of the urban fabric
which, until the Thirties, had been bounded by the road
network and surrounded on the outside by a continuous
curtain of wall fences and buildings. The continuity of the
building alignments is connected to the need to limit the
view on the neighbouring properties and to the practice
of orienting the residential buildings along the heliother-
mic axis that allows to maximize the benefits of solar
radiation.

The blocks of the historical fabric are mainly made up
of lots with a lengthened shape and with one or more
gates on the street. The residential building is generally
located in a central position with respect to the court-
yard, according to the typological scheme of the double
courtyard house, which is typical of central-southern
Campidano. However, there are also houses with a front
courtyard and houses on the roadside, which produce a
more irregular configuration of the lots. The typologies
of courtyard houses create a pattern of opposing blocks
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

with backward buildings in the lot and, in some cases,
with street-level buildings. In addition to the purely resi-
dential spaces, the courtyard houses have rustic attached
structures for processing and storing the agricultural
production and for gathering domestic animals (cellars,
oil mills, food stores, sheds and shelters for animals),
usually located in adherence to the fence wall (Baldacci
1952; Le Lannou 1979; Sanna and Atzeni 2009).

Until the 1950s, urban morphology was characterized
by a low building density with a prevalence of the empty
space over the built one. The demographic increase, after
the Second World War, produced deep alterations in the
urban structure, due to the interventions of subdivision,
elevation, demolition and reconstruction with obstruc-
tion of the courtyards, with a significant increase in
building density without a change in the urban bounda-
ries. The road system was also enriched with new alleys
that ensured access to the numerous building units, origi-
nally through the sharing between several owners of a
private area, until its complete acquisition to the public
domain.

The first step is represented by the study and interpre-
tation of the spatial relationships and the particular type
of building that characterize the specific historical set-
tlement. The plan analyses also the transformations that
have often led to phenomena of “typological degradation’,
caused by the inclusion of incompatible models in an his-
torical context. In the drafting of the plan it has been pro-
ceeded with the investigation, study and classification of
the buildings by referring to methodologies codified in
the type-morphological analysis, such as those of Mini-
mum Intervention Unit (UMI) (Caniggia 1979; Wallach
2000; Giambruno 2007).

The detailed urban plan subdivides the urban fab-
ric into Minimum Intervention Units (UMI), clusters of
areas and buildings that constitute uniform zones to be
subjected to conservation, requalification and/or trans-
formation actions. In the plan, the Minimum Interven-
tion Unit (UMI) represents a homogeneous reference
area for planning, relevant from a landscape point of
view, which guarantees the achievement of reasonable
standards of internal distribution, landscape quality and
urban decorum, in compliance with hygienic, health and
civil construction requirements.

Usually UMI is the same as the complex of open spaces
and buildings, typologically and constructively homo-
geneous in the original morphological layout, which
represent a functional unit of the urban fabric. The his-
torical-typological and landscape analysis of the plan
has been carried out on the single UMI, inside of which
the different constitutive components (buildings, roofs,
courtyards, uncovered area and ruins) are cartographi-
cally identified and classified.

The following categories are used for the classification
of UMIs:

¢« UMIs consisting of undeveloped areas, never built or
resulting from the demolition of the original build-
ing;

¢« UMIs consisting of substantially preserved building
structures, in which the typology, most of the origi-
nal buildings and open spaces are still preserved;

« UMIs consisting of partially preserved building struc-
tures in which the original typology is still unchanged
and part of the original buildings and open spaces
have been modified;

¢« UMIs consisting of substantially altered building
structures, in which the original type, buildings and
open spaces are modified.

Figure 1 highlights the prevalence of “substantially
transformed UMIs” (63%), which currently do not
include landscape values to be preserved but, in most
cases, require the adoption of actions for the redevelop-
ment and elimination of landscape detractors. This is
followed by “substantially preserved UMIs” (22%) and
“partially preserved UMIs” (13%), characterized by the
presence, more or less relevant, of elements of traditional
historical value to be preserved, although in many cases
altered by additions and new buildings incompatible with
the context.

Figure 2 illustrates the overview of the UMIs classifica-
tions based on the assessment of the historic landscape
value, in which the buildings are identified, clearly differ-
entiated between compatible (historical and recent) and
non-compatible buildings. The red perimeter highlights
the 367 UMIs interested by a proposal for the reconfigu-
ration of incompatible volumes.

The results of the survey focus on the degree of altera-
tion of the historic fabric caused by the phenomenon of
the replacement of significant parts of the historic herit-
age, also due to the weakness and ineffectiveness of the
protection policies, in particular in those parts of the

The urban fabric is particularly compromised, with
few surviving cases of fully preserved historical court-
yard houses in an acceptable state of conservation. It is
more frequent to find the presence of abandoned or sec-
ondary buildings in the courtyard, which was built in a
later period. Further alterations of the original pattern
include some isolated buildings in the centre of the lot
and multi-level buildings facing the street. They interrupt
the continuity of the curtain wall and make it difficult to
read the identity pattern. The presence of incompatible
buildings is particularly widespread in the historic fabric,
sometimes irreversibly changing the original layout of the
blocks.

Figure 3 identifies the buildings classified in the plan
as “new typologically incompatible’, for which a volun-
tary private initiative of demolition and reconstruction
is planned, according to criteria of harmonious integra-
tion and coherence with the identity of the fabric. The
demolition of the existing buildings cannot be imposed
if they are regularly designed in accordance with the
legislation and planning tools in force at the time of
their construction. Further restrictions on the build-
ing transformation, limiting the allowed interventions
only to extraordinary maintenance, are not sufficient to
promote voluntary operations of demolition. In general

the incompatible buildings stock, that dates back to the
second half of the Twentieth century, has a good level
of conservation and maintenance, finding an adequate
position and appreciation in the real estate market.

In the third phase of the research, a preliminary
appraisal of the existing buildings to be redeveloped
was made using the data on their state of conservation
and maintenance. Figure 4 shows the framework on the
state of conservation of incompatible buildings, accord-
ing to the qualitative levels defined in Table 1 (excel-
lent, good, medium, low, ruin).

As illustrated in Fig. 5, the state of maintenance and
conservation of the incompatible buildings is mainly
good (45%) and medium (47%), while a small percentage
is in low condition (8%). The substantial absence of build-
ings in an excellent state of conservation is due to the
restrictions on new developments in the historic centres,
introduced by the RLP in 2006, waiting for the adaptation
of the municipal planning tools. The condition of ruin is
generally found in buildings with historical and cultural
value that require the conservation of the original con-
struction components that have survived or the partial
reconstruction.

Figure 6 shows some indicative values of the premium
coefficient, calculated on the basis of the proposed for-
mula, to be used in the definition of the development
capacity to be assigned to each minimum unit of inter-
vention in case of a proposal for demolition and recon-
struction of the existing building, in order to ensure its
feasibility. The line expresses the value of the premium
coefficient according to the depreciation factor of the
existing building resulting from a specific market quota-
tion of new construction (1200 euro per square metre).
In this case, the depreciation coefficient, which falls in
the range from 0.4 to 0.8, makes it essential to increase
the development capacity in order to allow for the vol-

untary participation of private owners in the demolition
and reconstruction of the existing building.

ized into three different classes of historical landscape
value of the UMIs, which show remarkable differences
in terms of amount and average state of conservation
of incompatible buildings. In fact, there is a correla-
tion between the average value of the depreciation coef-
ficient of the incompatible buildings and the time of

construction and the degree of conservation of the build-
ing typology and the historical layout of each UMI. The
expected scenario of prevalence of incompatible build-
ings in the transformed UMI is also confirmed. Finally,
the data on the premium development capacity and the
residual one resulting from the demolition of the incom-
patible buildings are projected, on the basis of the indices
of suitability for building foreseen for each UMI, as part
of the general design of the plan. In the case of substan-
tially preserved UMI, 43% of the replacement develop-
ment capacity could be realized on site, while in the other
categories of UMI (partially preserved or transformed)
this percentage is reduced to 18-19%.

Discussion

The proper assessment of the economic advantage of
each plan intervention and the possible allocation of a
development rights reward to support its implementa-
tion, adapted to each property, appears to be difficult for
the political and technical decision-makers, as well as
unfair in the treatment of private property.

The development of simplified assessment models,
on which it is possible to inform the planning process,
makes it possible to program planning actions for the
recovery and redevelopment that can be really feasible
and practicable, contributing to the achievement of the
desired level of landscape quality.

The simulation of a non financial compensations sys-
tem in the detailed urban plan of Villasor highlights the
difficulties of an indistinct application on the whole his-
toric centre. The redevelopment of all the transformed
UMI, which have more recent buildings in good condi-
tions, requires the attribution of an excessive increase
in development capacity, which cannot in any way be
justified in local contexts with limited or almost no
demographic growth. It therefore needs to be balanced
according to certain priorities that the municipal author-
ity must define with the input of the planner: for exam-
ple, the elimination of incongruous elements, which alter
the original structure of the substantially preserved UMI,
is certainly a priority action to re-establish the quality of
the historic urban landscape.

The reconfiguration of buildings in a poor state of con-
servation, with an increase of at least 63% of development
capacity, has fewer effects in the overall assessment of the
development capacity within the general framework of
the plan.

In the case of a real estate asset in medium or good
condition, the required non financial compensation is
more than 100%, which has a significant impact on the
total development capacity of the plan and reduces the
chance of reconstruction on site.

Page 12 of 15

It is therefore indispensable to transfer part of the
development rights in areas external to the historic cen-
tre, leading to further critical issues for the planner and
the municipal administration in relation to the process
of estimation and management. The planning of urban
transformation projects through the demolition and
reconstruction of existing buildings is clearly critical with
respect to the transfer of development rights to undevel-
oped soils.

In built-up areas it is necessary to convert the existing
building into development rights by assessing its consist-
ency, state of conservation, conditions and use (Stang-
hellini 2013).

A possible transfer of development rights inevitably
involves the assessment of conversion parameters that
take into account the different values of the volumes in
the transition from the sending area to the receiving one
(Micelli 2011).

The methodology adopted in the paper did not con-
sider the impact of the area on the value of the exist-
ing building and on the final value, because this aspect
is negligible in the case of a complete redevelopment in
the original lot. The transfer requires the acquisition of
a suitable area or the identification of another owners’
property that is willing to receive the premium develop-
ment rights. In both cases, this represents an additional
burden for the purchase or compensation of the surface
right to the owner of the receiving area.

As a compensatory right, a careful evaluation of the
value of the alternative monetary compensation is neces-
sary. If the value of the development capacity granted is
lower than the value of the existing building, the owner
would have no interest in joining the proposed project.
Conversely, if the development capacity granted is exces-
sive, it would have some questionable, or even negative,
economic and urban planning consequences (Micelli
2012). The identification of the receiving area with equiv-
alent real estate values is therefore essential in order to
quantify the development rights to be attributed.

The choice can fall on a private owned area, requir-
ing an additional bonus to compensate for the impact of
the area on the project cost, or on a public owned area,
acquired as an additional contribution in real estate
development activities.

The elaboration of a detailed knowledge framework on
the settlement fabric, the morphological characteristics
and the state of conservation of the buildings, supported
by the use of GIS tools that allow the constant updating
of data, does not result in a higher quality and effective-
ness of the strategies and actions of the plan. The study
highlights the lack of effectiveness of the incentives pro-
vided for by regional laws that provide for an arbitrary
assessment of rewards, in the absence of detailed studies
Colavitti and Serra City Territ Archit (2020) 7:15

and evaluations. It also shows that the increase in the
development capacity, which is necessary to make the
demolition of the existing building volume economically
attractive, is inversely proportional to the market value of
the property.

Part of the development capacity may be developed
in compatible forms within the perimeter of the historic
centre in order to restore, where possible, the original
urban layout, while the surplus capacity may be trans-
ferred to areas suitable for transformation external to
the old centre, privately owned or offered by the local
government.

Conclusions

The above simulation is a model that can be reproduced
and adapted to different urban and landscape contexts, of
particular historical or environmental value, to promote
spontaneous regeneration actions on private initiative.
The proposed incentive scheme is more effective in areas
characterized by high real estate prices, which allow a
greater appreciation of the built volumes on the market
(Colavitti and Serra 2017). The model can therefore be
updated according to the specific conditions and trends
of the real estate market, also with the support of the GIS
system.

The case study of the Sardinia Region has enabled the
formulation of solutions that are applicable in national
and international contexts, which have been for a long
time the subject of intense debate on the need to take
advantage of market balance mechanisms to make more
effective administrative action through urban plan-
ning activities. In this direction, the redevelopment
of historic centres certainly represents an interesting
field of research, still today characterized by traditional
approaches strictly conformative and regulatory that
introduce strong limitations to the action of the private
investor. The rational and comprehensive character of the
Italian planning system is excessively rigid and unable to
reflect the ongoing evolution of the urban and social con-
text. It sometimes results in the imposition of rules and
proposals for major interventions that are not shared by
the local communities, given the lack of evaluation of the
effects on the legitimate interests of the owners, which
lead to processes of abandonment and degradation or,
even worse, to illegal building activity. This considera-
tion can be extended to the various levels of the regula-
tory and binding system aimed at protecting the territory
from an environmental, landscape, historical, cultural
and identity point of view.

The hypothesis of transferring the additional develop-
ment rights to alternative transformation areas, identi-
fied in the municipal urban plan, has opened the way to
the possibility of providing for a series of non financial

Page 13 of 15

compensations for the demolition of incompatible build-
ings, for the restoration and redevelopment of public
spaces, for the energy efficiency and for the elimination
of environmental negative effects (Stanghellini 2013;
Verones 2015). These premium development rights,
often referred to as development credits in regional laws,
are distinguished by their juridical independence from
the soils that generated them and their free use in areas
destined for transformation. An improper use of the
incentive scheme could result in a failure on the plan’s
effectiveness or even in deep inequalities in the distribu-
tion of surplus value.

A system of non financial compensation can certainly
be effective in urban areas with a substantial increase in
the value of real estate. Conversely, in smaller centres,
low real estate prices may sometimes require an excessive
increase in development capacity or may be insufficient
to guarantee real demand for new buildings, completely
affecting the purpose of the plan. A preliminary survey
aimed at verifying the presence of a real estate market
able to ensure the effectiveness of the incentive program
is therefore an essential step.

In addition, the effect of mechanisms based on the
allocation of compensatory and rewarding develop-
ment rights on the overall urban planning load should be
taken into account. These are development rights which
the administration grants as compensation that must be
guaranteed, otherwise undermining the local authority’s
right to amend town planning forecasts for reasons of
public interest (Trapani 2014).

The need to innovate forms and practices in the plan-
ning of historic centres should be part of a broader
framework of reform of municipal planning tools, which
opens up a series of issues related to the governance of
urban rent, which have been debated for decades.

There is no doubt that the plan is often conceived by
local communities as an opportunity to collect rents, in
the form of development capacity, against a culture of
recovery and redevelopment.

The new planning perspectives, which are set out by
a new idea of development right separated from land
ownership, allow us to hypothesize its exclusive use for
purposes related to urban and environmental regenera-
tion, to be applied not only to historical and consolidated
fabrics but also to coastal, natural or hydrogeological risk
areas. For example, development rights could be assigned
as a reward for the demolition of buildings considered
incompatible in areas of high historical, cultural and envi-
ronmental value and reconstruction in a suitable loca-
tion, in support of policies for the recovery and landscape
requalification of historic centres. This also provides an
effective mechanism for the capture of rents, minimized
for new expansion areas, and largely transformed into

recovery of the existing stock of buildings.
