Abstract

We present a novel patient-specific fluid-solid-growth framework to model the mechanobiological state of clinically detected
intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and their evolution. The artery and IA sac are modeled as thick-walled, non-linear elastic fiber-
reinforced composites. We represent the undulation distribution of collagen fibers: the adventitia of the healthy artery is
modeled as a protective sheath whereas the aneurysm sac is modeled to bear load within physiological range of pressures.
Initially, we assume the detected IA is stable and then consider two flow-related mechanisms to drive enlargement: (1) low
wall shear stress; (2) dysfunctional endothelium which is associated with regions of high oscillatory flow. Localized collagen
degradation and remodelling gives rise to formation of secondary blebs on the aneurysm dome. Restabilization of blebs is
achieved by remodelling of the homeostatic collagen fiber stretch distribution. This integrative mechanobiological modelling
workflow provides a step towards a personalized risk-assessment and treatment of clinically detected IAs.

1 Introduction

Intracranial aneurysm (IA), a localized focal out-pouching of
the cerebral vasculature, occurs in 3—5% of the adult popu-
lation. The risk of rupture is very low; however, if rupture
does occur, mortality rates are very high. Physicians select

IAs for intervention by weighing up rupture likelihood with
risks associated with treatments. Unfortunately, personalized
rupture risk assessment remains elusive and, consequently,
intervention may be recommended for IAs that are stable.

Despite continuous efforts on identifying the etiology of
the disease, the exact causes of aneurysm formation, growth,
stabilization and/or rupture are still not fully understood.
Correlations with genetic factors [such as tissue disor-
ders, polycistic kidney disease, first-degree family history
etc. (Samuel and Radovanovic 2019)], gender (Desai et al.
2019), ethnicity (Detmer et al. 2019) and external factors
(such as high blood pressure, smoking, drugs abuse, head
trauma or brain tumor, infection of the arterial wall) have
been reported (Toth and Cerejo 2018). Here, we focus on
modelling the flow-mediated mechanisms (Cebral et al.
2016) that influence IA pathobiology.

Recent developments in imaging technology have led to
asymptomatic [As being detected more frequently (Ventikos
et al. 2009). Hence there is an increasing need to identify
IAs that are stable and not in need of intervention. This will
reduce the (increasing) financial burden of the disease and
will help to reduce unnecessary intervention. Computational
models of IAs that quantify their mechanobiological state
(and it’s potential evolution) may provide insight into IA
stability and thus assist personalized diagnosis.

Computational mechano-biological models of IAs need
to account for: (1) the biomechanics of the arterial/aneu-
rysm wall; (2) the cellular biology of the tissue and (3) the
dynamic interplay between (1) and (2), i.e. the mechano-
biology. Over a decade ago, (Humphrey and Taylor 2008)
emphasized the need for a new class of Fluid-Solid-Growth
models to study aneurysm evolution and proposed the termi-
nology FSG models. These combine fluid and solid mechan-
ics to quantify the flow and structural mechanical stimuli
that drive mechanobiological processes. FSG models have
been applied by several research groups to model abdominal
aortic aneurysm (Zeinali-Davarani and Baek 2012; Watton
et al. 2012; Aparicio et al. 2014; Wu and Shadden 2015;
Grytsan et al. 2015) and IA evolution (Watton et al. 2008,
2009a, 201 1a, b; Selimovic et al. 2014).

To date, FSG models have explored phenomenological
relationships between mechanical stimuli and tissue remod-
elling that give rise aneurysm evolution. Nevertheless, they
provide a framework for integration of cell models and rep-
resentation of biochemical pathway models of the arterial
wall (Harvey et al. 2018; Aparicio 2016) which will provide
further insight into disease pathophysiology.

Previous FSG models have IA evolution from an initial
healthy artery. However, from a clinical perspective char-
acterizing the mechanobiolgical stability (and potential
evolution) from the clinical detected geometry is what is
important. In this work, we present an integrative FSG mod-
elling framework for the personalized quantification of the
mechanobiological state of an [A and it’s potential evolution.
This has been realized within Sim4Life (Neufeld et al. 2013),
a Computational Life Sciences (CLS) simulation platform
co-developed by the IT’IS Foundation and ZMT Zurich
MedTech AG.

We build on previous studies (e.g. Watton et al. 201 1b;
Selimovic et al. 2014) to incorporate several new features:
integrative pipeline from imaging to simulation; application
to patient-specific IA geometries; integration of a novel col-
lagen fiber distribution model into FE code; linking growth
and remodelling to pulsatile flow metrics; simulation of sec-
ondary blebs; adaption of collagen homeostasis to stabilize
IA.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews
the thick-walled structural model, the computational fluid
dynamics solver and the growth and remodeling approach.
Simulation results are presented in Sect. 3: first for obtaining
the initial homeostatic state in patient-specific geometries;
secondly for two different flow-driven remodelling scenar-
ios. Finally, Sect. 5 discusses conclusions and limitations
of the model.

2 Computational framework
and mathematical model
for the aneurysm evolution

The computational frawework presented is implemented
into Sim4Life (Neufeld et al. 2013), a state-of-the-art
simulation platform for computational life sciences cen-
tered around high-resolution, detailed anatomical phan-
toms functionalized with dynamic physiology and tissue
models; image-based modelling is strongly supported.
The platform features a modular graphical user interface
(GUI), VTK- and OpenGL-based visualization, a Python
scripting interface, and a pipeline framework for advanced
analysis. It incorporates:

e A robust vessel segmentation software, capable of deal-
ing with diseased vessel geometries and a multitude of
imaging modalities, and supporting efficient interactive
corrections where automatic segmentation fails.

e A comprehensive pipeline supporting all steps from
image-based model creation to results analysis, includ-
ing: tissue property assignment; shape characterization;
fluid dynamics modeling (with physiologically realis-
tic boundary conditions); solid mechanics; growth and
remodeling simulation; analysis, post-processing and
visualisation.

It provides the first complete simulation pipeline for mod-
eling growth of clinically detected IA, see Fig. 1.

2.1 Kinematics

The vessel wall experiences large displacement and is
made of a nearly incompressible material (Holzapfel
2000). From the structural point of view, it can be decom-
posed into three layers: intima, media, and adventitia. For
a comprehensive analysis of the wall architecture, see Rob-
ertson and Watton (2013).

This study models the wall with a the three-dimen-
sional, two-layered thick-wall structure (Teixeira 2019).
The endothelial layer is assumed to be mechanically irrele-
vant, while the medial layer is composed of isotropic mate-
rials (elastin, passive smooth muscle ground matrix etc.)
and two families of anisotropic collagen fibers; the outer
adventitial layer is composed of collagen fibers embedded
in an isotropic matrix.

The Lagrangian formulation used in this work denotes
the deformation gradient as F, the Green-Lagrange
strain tensor as E, and the right Cauchy-Green ten-
sor as C=F’F. The near-incompressible effects are
accounted with a multiplicative split of the deformation

elling of cerebral aneurysms

gradient F=J'/°F, where J = det(F), see Holzapfel
et al. (2000). The modified versions of the right Cauchy-
Green tensor and Green-Lagrange (GL) strain tensor are
defined by C=F’F, and E= 5(C- I), respectively.
The modified tensor invariants’ are simply /, = ¢r(C),
1, = (tr(C)* — tr(C))/2 and I, = det(C) = 1.

The direction of the collagen fibers is denoted by the
unit vector m', i= 1,2. The total stretch Ki, expresses the
total stretch in the direction m'’. The modified version
X, = J~'/ 2 can be evaluated by

(A')° =m! - Cm' =T' (Cm), (1)

i.e., associated with / \s a pseudo-invariant of C and mi’.

We assume the hyperelasticity hypothesis, which implies
the existence of an energy function ‘¥ = ¥(C). The strain
energy function ¥ (SEF) is split into an additive sum of
isochoric (volume-preserving) and dilatational (volume-
changing) parts (Simo et al. 1985)

receives contributions from the dilatational elastic response
of the tissue. Hence

2.2.2 Collagenous constituents

The constitutive model for the collagen accounts for the
experimental observation that collagen fibers have a a dis-
tribution of waviness in the unloaded configuration and
thus have a distribution of recruitment (Hill et al. 2012).
The strain energy function involves integrating the strain
energy for a fiber (er .) over the distribution of recruitment
stretches (p'_ ),

We model the fiber recruitment distribution using a

of the distribution (see Fig. 7). More specifically:

2015). The numerical solution of linear system through Alge-
braic Multigrid (AMG) Methods relies on HYPRE (Chow
et al. 1998).

A specialized structural solver has been developed based on
the FEM solver framework. It supports compressible/incom-
pressible, homogeneous/heterogeneous, linear/non-linear, and
isotropic/anisotropic material models, multiple populations
of collagen fibers with varying orientations and recruitment
stretch distributions.

2.4 Computational fluid dynamics

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver was also devel-
oped on the basis of the FEM solver framework. It supports
P,-P, elements through Variational Multiscale Stabilization
(Bazilevs et al. 2007; Forti and Dedé 2015; Liu and Marsden
2018). The algebraic system is solved with FGMRES (Saad
1993), preconditioned with one iteration of SIMPLE (Patankar
and Spalding 1983; Pernice and Tocci 2001). Internally, the
velocity and Schur complement blocks are preconditioned
with fixed iterations of HYPRE (Falgout and Yang 2002).

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used
to model flow. The physical parameters of the simulated
fluid resemble those of blood: density p, = 1066 kg/m? and
dynamic viscosity “yp = 3.5 X 10-3 Pas. Three cardiac cycles
of 0.8s each were simulated with time-step 0.004s. Figure 3
plots the inlet flow rate and outlet pressure boundary condi-
tions (Villa-Uriol et al. 2011).

2.4.1 Flow metrics

Given the fluid pressure p and velocity v, let
o = —pl+ w(Vv + Vv")

denote the Newtonian fluid stress tensor, and 4 be an out-
ward unit normal vector at the lumen surface. The wall shear
stress vector T is given by

T= on—(on)-n

and represents the shearing component of the traction vec-
tor on.

The complex geometry of arteries coupled with pulsatile
flow gives rise to regions of the vasculature that are sub-
ject to oscillatory flow (magnitude and direction). This can
be quantified by a novel flow metric, the wall shear stress
aspect ratio (WSSAR) which naturally emerges from quan-
tifying the shear stress rosettes, which capture the multi-
directionality of flow (Krishna et al. 2020). The WSSAR
measures the bidirectionality of the WSS over a given inter-
val [0, 7] (Krishna et al. 2020). It is calculated as follows:
given a point x on the wall, let tT = t(x, t) denote the WSS at
the point x for ¢ € [0, 7], and 7, = y, (x) and 7, = n,(x) two
orthogonal directions which

2.5 Growth and remodelling of the constituents

Clinical studies indicate that the medial layer degrades dur-
ing aneurysm development, the intima layer disappears, the
internal elastic lamina is lost, and apoptosis of vascular smooth
muscle cells is observed (Tong et al. 2014). At the same time,
the adventitia layer thickens.

For this model, the starting point is an already developed
IA. Initial mass-densities of elastin, collagen and smooth mus-
cle cells are prescribed to represent atrophy of the medial layer.
Subsequent degradation is driven by linking the mass-densities
of constituents to perturations of flow metrics from homeo-
static values. Although this approach still does not represent
the full complexity of the IA formation with respect to the
hemodynamic environment, it is step forward with respect to
its application to anatomical IA geometries (Teixeira 2019).

2.5.1 Mass degradation

Additional aneurysm enlargement is modeled as a localized
degradation of the layer L through the decay of the elastin
(m, .), collagen (mm, .), and smooth muscle cells normalized
masses (7m, ,,,,) (Watton et al. 201 1a). The normalized mass
degradation is defined as

F. S. Teixeira et al.

where D,,,,, 1S the maximum rate of degradation, y = e for
elastin and y = c for collagen in the layer L; Fy represents
the influence of hemodynamics on G&R by linking colla-
gen and elastin degradation to WSS-related metrics (Watton
et al. 201 1b).

The hemodynamic environment of an IA is intimately
related to it’s initiation, growth and rupture (Robertson
and Watton 2012; Cebral et al. 2019). It is observed that
endothelial cells may still be present in developed aneurysms
(Froésen et al. 2004 ) and biochemical pathways associated
with functional/dysfunctional endothelium are likely to play
a role in enlargement and rupture. In the following examples,
we consider simple phenomenological relationships between
regions of destructive remodelling and perturbed flow; firstly
low WSS and, secondly, high oscillatory flow.

Low WSS: We follow Watton et al. (2009a), Watton et al.
(201 1b), Watton et al. (201 1a), Selimovic et al. (2014) and
assume a simple phenomological relationship between the
WSS and degenerative processes of an JA, i.e. without
explicitly modelling biochemical pathways. More specifi-
cally, Fyss in Eq. 10, is taken to be quadratic:

I, [Iz|| <7,
to — IItI1\*
Fwess(T) = ————]} ,7, <||tll <t> (11)
0, To < |I|tII.

where degradation is maximal if ||t|| < t,, and there is no
degradation if t; < ||t||. For illustration, we follow Watton
et al. (2009a) and assume that if the WSS is below | Pa, it
will drive degenerative processes. We set T- = 1 Pa, t, = 0.5
Pa and D,,,x = 1.5. Figure 4 plots the function Fy. with the
above-mentioned values.

WSSAR: We hypothesize that endothelial morphology
is related to the oscillatory nature of the flow and suppose
that there exists a switch point where endothelial cells have
distinct phenotypes, i.e. spindle or irregular morphologies.
The morphology of the cells may affect the permeability
and functionality of the endothelial layer. Specifically, we
assume that regions where endothelial cells have irregular
morphologies will drive destructive remodelling processes.

The spatially-variable function F,p(t) quantifies the
WSSAR (defined as Tap), such that, F7,p = 0 means no
degradation and Fap = 1 yields maximum degradation.
The existence of thresholds 7; ,p is hypothesized, such that
the degradation is maximal if Ty ap < Tap, and absent if
Tar < Tc ap: In this case, Far is given a simple quadratic
form as

0, Tar <TCAR
Trip —T
AR — TC,AR
Frp(t) = | eas > TCAR STaR STHaR (12)
TAR.H — ™C.AR
1, TH AR S TaR

For illustration, we suppose that a WSSAR magnitude of 0.7
acts as a switch point for endothelial cells (ECs) to be packed
irregularly. For the simulations, the critical threshold to acti-
vate degradation is set to Tc ap = 0.7 Pa, while ty ap = 0.8
Pa. Diyax 18 set to 1.5. Figure 5 plots the function Fp with
the above-mentioned values.

configuration in a state of stretch (Humphrey 1999). A con-
sequence of this is that in the unloaded configuration they
may appear wavy and thus the tissue needs to be stretched
for a wavy fiber to be recruited to load bearing. Watton et al.
2004 introduced the terminology: attachment stretch, 14. att:
to denote the stretch a fiber is configured to the matrix in the
loaded configuration; recruitment stretch, Rays to denote the
amount the unloaded tissue must be stretched (in the fiber
direction) for the fiber to straighten out and begin to bear load.
The collagen fiber stretch is then related to the tissue stretch
Ji, by the simple relationship 1/,. = 1,/ 1, —if the tissue is in
homeostasis (at physiological stretch) A). = Age att:

In vitro studies show that there is a distribution of collagen
fiber recruitment stretches (Hill et al. 2012). Equivalently, this
implies that there exists a distribution of attachment stretches:
fibers which are recruited first to load bearing will be con-
figured with maximum attachment stretches and fibers which
are last to be recruited to load bearing will have minimum
attachment stretches. Chen (2014) generalized the remodelling
approach of Watton et al. (2004) to account for remodelling of
a distribution of fibers. The initial distribution of recruitment
(t = O) is determined by assuming a prescribed range of fiber
attachment stretches. Remodelling of the recruitment stretch
distribution then acts to maintain the collagen fiber stretch dis-
tribution (in the loaded configuration) towards the attachment
stretch distribution, simulating the natural consequence of fiber
deposition/degradation. Mathematically, this is achieved by
evolving the recruitment stretch distribution so that the col-
lagen stretch distribution remodels towards the attachment
stretch distribution (Aparicio et al. 2016):

where we assume collagen fibers remodel to achieve a maxi-
mum stretch during the cardiac cycle and we assume that
this will occur either at systole or diastole (Watton et al.
201 1a).

We define three thresholds, namely 1,75 qe and
aon. The fibers with lowest attachment stretch 1’: ae will be
recruited last and therefore have the highest recruitment Ae ven
while fibers attached with 1": deat are recruited first and have
the smallest recruitment stretch Ae min’ This implies that the

2.5.3 Collagen growth

The collagen fiber growth is modeled by the evolution of
the normalized mass m,,.. We assume that (Watton and
Ventikos 2009):

e The number of fibroblasts is proportional to the mass
of collagen they are maintaining.

e Fibroblasts evolve their stress-free configuration as the
collagen fabric remodels and they configure to the
matrix to achieve a homeostatic stretch 4/, att”

e Collagen mass growth/atrophy is driven by deviation

of fibroblast stretch from the homeostatic levels.

The simplest equation to model this phenomenon is

where e; > O1is a growth rate parameter. We assume that the
natural configuration of a fibroblast cell to be identical to the
natural configuration of the collagen fibers (with maximum
stretch) and so d/, y= i, and the above equation can be writ-

ten in terms of the collagen fiber stretch.

2.5.4 Collagen stabilization mechanism

The adventitia acts as a protective sheath against overdis-
tension of an artery due to natural variations in systemic
pressure (Schmid et al. 2013). The implication being that
it’s load-bearing role at physiological pressures may be
negligible (age, species, location dependent). Conversely,
the parent dome of an intracranial aneurysm can consist of
a thin collagenous sac which bears all the pressure load at
physiological pressures, i.e. it is not acting as a protective
mechanical sheath. These observations imply that the col-
lagen fiber stretch distribution for the sac will differ from
that of the protective sheath. Moreover, the fact that IAs
generally stabilize in size implies that the collagen fabric
is in mechanobiological equilibrium and thus the adven-
titial collagen fabric homeostasis adapts—suggesting that
fibers are configured to bear more load as the load-bearing
role of the medial layer is lost.

We simulate this by remodelling the distribution of
attachment stretches (Mandaltsi 2016). Here we do not
model how this is biologically achieved—rather we sim-
ply prescribe its adaption to achieve a new homeostasis

2.6 Heterogeneous characterization of the arterial
wall

The geometry (obtained from Prof. Robertson, University
of Pittsburgh) was extracted from computed tomography
(CT). The generation of surface and volumetric meshes
were performed in Sim4Life. In order to reduce the compu-
tational burden of the structural analysis, the computation
was restricted to the neighborhood of the dome region. The
planar cuts in the parent artery were selected far enough
from the dome to avoid extra stresses caused by the clamped
boundaries. The domain of interest was further split into
parent artery, neck and dome subregions in order to locally
adapt the mechanical characterization of the wall. Figure 6
shows the whole geometry and depicts each subregion.

2.6.1 Physiological parametrization

Tables | and 2 specify the list of parameters for the math-
ematical model (see Sect. 2 and Teixeira (2019) for a
detailed description). The values reflect the physiologi-
cal function of each layer for the wall for distinct healthy
(parent artery) and diseased regions (aneurysm dome). For
example, in the parent artery, the adventitia is assumed to
act as a protective sheath (Schmid et al. 2013), and there-
fore the collagen fibers in this layer are only recruited at
supraphysiological pressure. On the other hand, the adven-
titia acts as the main load-bearing component in the aneu-
rysm dome (due the degradation of the medial layer), and
therefore the collagen fibers must be recruited within the
physiological range of pressures so that they are load-bear-
ing (Robertson and Watton 2013). The initial recruitment
stretch values are determined so that collagen achieves a

prescribed homeostatic fiber stretch distribution at t = 0;
Fig. 7 illustrates attachment and recruitment stretch dis-
tributions using an illustrative stretch of 1.3.

The neck region is considered to be a transition region,
with parameters being linearly interpolated between the
healthy artery and the aneurysm sac.

2.6.2 Collagen fiber orientation

We model the collagen fiber orientations on the aneurysm
dome to coincide with the principal curvature directions (Ma
et al. 2007), whilst those in the parent artery are modeled
as splayed about the circumferential direction (Holzapfel
et al. 2000). Figure 8 depicts the resulting fiber orientation
control: in the dome region, the directions were based on
the principal curvature; in the parent artery, the directions

D) Springer

Fig.8 Collagen fiber directions (blue and white arrows) in the dome
and parent artery regions

were modified (rotated) 30° (in the medial layer) and 60°
(in the adventitial layer) with respect to the circumferential
direction. To maintain continuity of the fiber orientations,
we interpolate the fiber directions in the neck region.

2.7 Simulation setup

Most IAs stabilize and remain asymptomatic. Hence, when
an IA is detected, it is more likely to be stable than unsta-
ble. The iterative method to define the initial homeostasis
in personalized geometries was established in Teixeira
(2019). As a next step, the degradation phase implements
two degradation approaches to model collagen and elas-
tin evolution: (1) linked to low steady-state WSS, and (2)
linked to pulsatile flow metrics (see Sect. 2.4.1). Finally,
the stabilization phase proposes a mechanism based on
remodelling the attachment stretches so that the col-
lagen fabric can bear more load in homeostasis without
increases in mass. Secondary bleb formation is simulated
for a period of 3 years after initial homeostasis: 2 years of
degradation linked to flow metrics, and 1 year of stabili-
zation (see Sect. 2.5); The applied time-step of 0.02 year
requires a total of 150 steps.

For each time-step of the disease evolution problem,
steady-state structural analysis of the reduced domain (see
Fig. 6) is performed for diastolic and systolic pressures. The
disease evolution model at each point is driven by the maxi-
mum X00 see Eq. (5), of the systolic and diastolic configu-
rations. CFD analyses recompute the WSS field over the
whole domain every 20 steps after the onset of degradation
(at time-step 50). The steady-state CFD analysis uses a con-
stant inlet flow rate of 2.54 x 10~°m?/s and constant outlet
pressures of 9671.38 Pa and 9833.19 Pa, respectively, which
represents the mean flow rate over the cardiac cycle. For the

D) Springer

F. S. Teixeira et al.

G&R linked to WSSAR, transient CFD analyses runs for
2.4s (three cardiac cycles) with time-step 0.002s (total of
600 time-steps, 200 per cardiac cycle) and uses the physi-
ological inlet flow rate and outlet pressure waves depicted
in Fig. 3.

Each full G&R simulation which is linked to steady-state
flow took 7 hours on average to run using 10 MPI processes
on a Windows desktop computer equipped with an Intel
Core i9-7900X 3.31GHz processor and 64GB of RAM.
Those linked to transient flow took 26 hours on average.

3 Results

In this section, first we overview the numerical approach to
model a stabilized IA. From this homeostatic state, devel-
opment of secondary blebs is subsequently driven by link-
ing collagen degradation to deviation of flow metrics from
homeostatic ranges. Lastly, remodelling of the distribution
of collagen fiber attachment stretches stabilizes the blebs.

3.1 Initial homeostasis

Given an initial prescribed recruitment stretch distribution
field and established targets for collagen fiber stretch dis-
tribution (i.e. the minimum, mode, maximum attachment
stretches), an iterative process searches for a (spatially
heterogeneous) recruitment distribution field which yields
mechanobiological equilibrium for the loaded IA. For the
investigated configuration, a simulation with 50 iterations
was sufficient to achieve homeostasis.

Figure 9 depicts the displacement evolution from the ini-
tial deformed geometry to the (initial) homeostatic configu-
ration. Figure 10 depicts the minimum, mode and maximum
values of the collagen fiber stretch distribution. Notice that
in the homeostatic state, these values are spatially uniform
and equal to prescribe homeostatic values (see Table 2) and
the collagen fabric is in mechanobiological equilibrium.

The evolution of the recruitment stretch distribution in
Fig. 11, driven by Eq. (13), shows that the recruitment
stretch distribution was overestimated and decreases so that
collagen fiber stretch distribution remodels to the attach-
ment stretch distribution, i.e. via Eq. (6); Fig. 12 illustrates
the evolution of the recruitment stretches over the aneurysm
sac from the initial pressurized state to the the initial homeo-
Static state.

3.2 Enlargement

Figure 13 illustrates Fy, at t = 0 and the spatial distribu-
tions of WSS at t = 0 andt = 2. In regions where the WSS is
below 0.5, maximum degradation occurs (indicated by Fs
=1). It can be seen that the whole aneurysm sac enlarges

in size and a prominant secondary bleb develops on the
upstream region of the aneurysm sac where a region of low
WSS 1s located. This is facilitated by a feedback mechanism
whereby the regions of low WSS enlarge in size as the aneu-
rysm enlarges (compare Fig. 13b, c).

Figure 14 illustrates Fy, at t = 0 and the spatial distribu-
tions of WSSAR att = 0 andt = 2. Regions of high WSSAR
are associated with oscillatory flow and we hypothesize that
in these regions the endothelium will have an irregular mor-
phology. In these locations, i.e. the white regions of Fig. 14a
where Fyp = 1, degradation is maximal. For this example,
F xp does not have localized maxima and consequently the
whole IA sac is seen to enlarge without the development of
focal secondary blebs.

The impact on the blood flow velocity field of distinct
WSS-related degradation hypotheses is evident in Fig. 15,
which compares the velocity streamline from the initial
homeostasis (common to all degradation methods) to that
of each resulting configuration.

3.3 Stabilization

Figure 16 illustrates the collagen fiber stretch distributions
in the final stabilized state for low-WSS driven enlargement
(upper) and high-WSSAR driven enlargement (lower).
As material is degraded and the IA sac enlarges, the fiber
stretches increase to maintain mechanical equilibrium. As
the stabilization mechanism is a point-wise relation, see
Eq. 15, the mechanobiological equilibrium at the final home-
ostatic state contains a spatially-variable attachment stretch
field. It can be seen that the magnitudes of the attachment
stretch distribution (see Fig. 16) have increased (compare
with Fig. 10). More specifically, to stabilize the aneurysm,
the attachment stretch distribution evolves from a spatially
homogeneous distribution where min/ mode/max attachment
stretches of the distribution are 1.01/1.05/1.1 to a spatially
heterogeneous distribution where these values increase up
to 1.07/1.12/1.17, respectively.

4 Discussion

We have presented the first Fluid-Solid-Growth frame-
work to model IA growth and stabilization for personalized
(image-based) IA geometries. Two illustrative scenarios to
drive [A enlargement are presented: low WSS and com-
plex, oscillatory flow. We propose a novel approach to link
endothelial morphology (aligned vs. irregular) to a novel
pulsatile flow metric (WSSAR) and subsequently localized
degradation of the tissue. Moreover, the model integrates a
mechanism to account for aneurysm stabilization, 1.e. adap-
tion of the adventitial collagen fabric via remodelling of the
collagen fiber attachment stretch distribution.

The model is fully implemented into Sim4Life, a state-of-
the-art simulation platform for computational life sciences
(Neufeld et al. 2013). To our knowledge, Sim4Life is the
first fully integrative framework for modeling IA evolution
of its type: it incorporates user-friendly tools which span
from image segmentation to simulation of IA enlargement.

We utilized an isochoric split of the deformation gradi-
ent for our finite element (FE) model. It is recognized that
this can cause problems for fiber-reinforced materials that
lead to FE simulations producing unrealistic behaviour
(volumetric swelling) of a material (Sansour 2008; Helfen-
stein et al. 2010; Giiltekin et al. 2019). Essentially, from an
energy minimization perspective, at a critical fiber stretch, it
becomes energetically more favourable to swell the material
as opposed to stretch along the fiber direction (Zdunek et al.
2014). Interestingly, the (isochoric) fiber stretch at which
this occurs can be calculated by consideration of the relative
stiffnesses of the bulk modulus and embedded fiber (Zdunek
et al. 2014). If a material is modeled to have a stiffness that
increases exponentially, then—for physiological consistent

material parameters—this issue occurs at relatively small
deformation, e.g. fiber stretches < 1.2. However, if a material
has constant stiffness, then a bulk modulus value can be cho-
sen so that the issue does not occur (Zdunek et al. 2014). The
constitutive model that we adopt for collagen has a constant
stiffness once all fibers are recruited and thus a bulk modulus
can be chosen appropriately to maintain incompressibility
whilst using an isochoric-split of the deformation gradient;
volumetric changes were within 2%, see Fig. 17.

The constitutive model for collagen assumed a linear rela-
tionship between the Ist Piola—Kirchoff stress and stretch for
individual fibers. A nonlinear relation is applied to model
the deformation of the fibers and the total strain-energy of
the fiber ensemble requires an integral over the recruitment
distribution (Hill et al. 2012). Whilst an exponential strain
energy function is often used to capture the gross mechani-
cal response of collagen, the nonlinear behaviour is a con-
sequence of individual fibers being recruited to load over
a range of recruitment stresses while the individual fibers
have a linear response (see discussion in Zhang et al. (2016).
This is found to be suitable for modelling the response of
arteries (Bevan et al. 2018). It is of note that the triangular

D) Springer

recruitment stretch distribution (and linear fiber response)
yields analytic expressions for the total stress of the fiber
ensemble,and is therefore straightforward to implement into
FE codes.

A typical healthy arterial wall is composed of three layers
(intima, media and adventitia—some regions contain inter-
nal and external elastic lamina to separate the layers) and
several components (ECs, elastin, collagen, proteoglycans,
fibrilin, nerves, fibroblast, vasa vasorum, etc.). We assumed
that the diseased tissue region features a loss of internal elas-
tin lamina and a degraded extracellular matrix. The constitu-
tive model for reinforced collagenous fiber we assume here
is relatively simple to account for the full complexity of the
wall constituents and physiological processes which happen
in the artery. They could be augmented with models of pas-
sive and active SMCs response (Bhogal et al. 2019) (which
play an important role in aneurysm formation (Kondo et al.
1998)), angle dispersion of collagen fibers (Holzapfel et al.
2015), and macrophage infiltration (proinflammatory signal-
ing—which are linked to flow and drive aneurysm formation
(Harvey et al. 2018) and progression (Frésen et al. 2019),
and anisotropic volumetric growth models (Grytsan et al.

configuration. A pre-stressing algorithm (Weisbecker et al.
2014) is required to compute the actual unloaded configura-
tion, such that the given input geometry is the loaded con-
figuration. Note also that due to the lack of imaging resolu-
tion, the wall thickness has to be artificially defined; here we
adopted a uniform thickness.

Experiments show that blood exhibits a Newtonian behav-
iour in most large arteries (Ku 1997), and a non-Newtonian
behavior in vessels with a diameter below 100um (Popel
and Johnson 2005). Several publications debate the impact
of the flow model on numerical modeling because of the
particulare nature of blood (Blanco et al. 2006; Xiang et al.
2011; Evju and Mardal 2015; Sagqr et al. 2019). The general
consensus is that Newtonian and non-Newtonian models are
useful, and that their applicability depends on the size of
the arterial lumen. Even though (Xiang et al. 2012) reports
that Newtonian model can overestimate WSS, (Cebral et al.
2011, 2016) finds no evidence to prefer the non-Newtonian
model over the Newtonian one. Because the arteries of the

circle of Willis are still large with respect to the RBCs size,
we followed Steinman and Pereira (2019) in this work and
modeled blood as a Newtonian flow, with constant viscos-
ity py.

ECs morphology is hypothesized to affect wall remod-
eling (Kaneko et al. 2018). Permeability dysfunction leads
to transmigration of leucocytes into the wall and degrada-
tion of the extracellular matrix (Babu et al. 2015). Here
we proposed a novel approach to predict EC morphology
and link it to localized degradation of the wall. For illus-
tration, we implemented this with a novel pulsatile flow
metric that quantifies the oscillatory nature of the flow,
1.e. WSSAR (Krishna et al. 2020). However other pulsatile
flow metrics could be employed for the same purpose, e.g.
OSI or high WSS, which were recently correlated to pro-
inflammatory signaling and aneurysm initiation (Frésen
et al. 2019). Furthermore, EC morphology is linked to
cyclic deformation of the wall (Watton et al. 201 1a) and
hence the algorithm could be enhanced to include this

additional mechanobiological influence. The influence of
cyclic deformation on remodelling can be easily included:
our framework currently simulate the evolution of sys-
tolic and diastolic fields as in Watton et al. (201 1a) and
already incorporates a monolithic fluid-structure interac-
tion solver.

The mechanisms that lead to IA formation, growth and
rupture are incompletely understood. From a CFD per-
spective, each of these phases appears to be correlated to
non-physiological low WSS, high WSS, oscillatory flow
and combinations of them (Staarmann et al. 2019). Follow
up imaging depicting enlarging IAs obtained from clinical
databases (Bijlenga et al. 2019) will assist in generating
and testing G&R hypotheses in future applications of the
framework.

There is a need to move beyond phenomenological cor-
relations that relate flow metrics to IA stability/growth.
More specifically, mechanistic understanding of the
governing mechanobiology of IAs is needed to improve
management of the disease (Robertson and Watton 2012).
We envision that the application of the presented in silico

framework to in vitro and in vivo (animal/human) models,
e.g. (Kaneko et al. 2018; Cebral et al. 2015, 2016; Wang
et al. 2018; Cebral et al. 2018, 2019; Frésen et al. 2019),
will be a step towards this goal.

5 Summary

This paper presents the first integrative fluid-solid-growth
modelling framework with application to modelling enlarge-
ment/stabilization of patient-specific IAs. It will provide new
mechanistic insight into the mechanobiology of IA disease.
