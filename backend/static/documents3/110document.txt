Abstract: Life-like humanoid robots are on the rise, aiming at communicative purposes that
resemble humanlike conversation. In human social interaction, the facial expression serves important
communicative functions. We examined whether a robot's face is similarly important in human-robot
communication. Based on emotion research and neuropsychological insights on the parallel processing
of emotions, we argue that greater plasticity in the robot’s face elicits higher affective responsivity,
more closely resembling human-to-human responsiveness than a more static face. We conducted
a between-subjects experiment of 3 (facial plasticity: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially
static robot) x 2 (treatment: affectionate vs. maltreated). Participants (N = 265; Mage = 31.5) were
measured for their emotional responsiveness, empathy, and attribution of feelings to the robot. Results
showed empathically and emotionally less intensive responsivity toward the robots than toward the
human but followed similar patterns. Significantly different intensities of feelings and attributions
(e.g., pain upon maltreatment) followed facial articulacy. Theoretical implications for underlying
processes in human-robot communication are discussed. We theorize that precedence of emotion and
affect over cognitive reflection, which are processed in parallel, triggers the experience of ‘because I
feel, I believe it’s real,’ despite being aware of communicating with a robot. By evoking emotional
responsiveness, the cognitive awareness of ‘it is just a robot’ fades into the background and appears
not relevant anymore.

1. Introduction

“When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but creatures
of emotion.” Dale Carnegie (2012, p. 16), Emotional Intelligence.

Robots are being introduced in our society at rapid pace, not only in terms of industrial machines
or housekeeping support such as lawn mowers and robotic vacuums but increasingly so in terms
of humanlike and embodied ‘social entities’ that are built for communicative and social purposes.
Various sources predict that robots “will permeate wide segments of daily life by 2025” [1] and 2016
was claimed as a pivotal year for the proliferation of humanoid social robots [2]. Particularly in view of
aging societies [3,4], and shrinking financial and human resources to sustain sufficient levels of social
welfare and healthcare [5], an increase in need for supportive social robots is foreseen [6,7]. In other
areas such as education and public service, social robots are on the rise as well [8-10]. Robots capable

of exhibiting natural-appearing social qualities are particularly promising because human-to-human
communication is the most intuitive and natural way of interaction. To investigate the social nature of
social robots as driven by their communicative function, insights from mediated communication and
media psychological research are in place [9,11].

Researchers argue that creating a feeling of relating to the robot in a way we normally do in
face-to-face communication would facilitate the interaction with communicative humanoid robots.
For example, when the user attributed “a mind,’ the robot was more easily accepted [7,12] and affective
involvement or empathy is likewise considered key in social robotics research [13,14]. Previous work on
computer-mediated communication showed that people tend to treat the machine-mediated interaction
as human-based. As argued in the empirically supported paradigms of Computers Are Social Actors
(CASA) [15,16] and Media Equation [17,18], people apply human schemata of communication to
computers and other media. Studies in human-robot interaction often refer to these frameworks [19].
Building on the general principle that human schemata of communication are applied to mediated
interaction, the current study aims to go beyond in detailing how facial articulacy and affective
processes are important to exploit the full potential of human-robot communication.

In the following, we outline the theoretical arguments that underpin our hypotheses. Then,
we explain the methodology and experimental design to test those hypotheses, assuming differences
in users’ responses to variations in facial articulacy of two humanoid robots and a human face. Results
are then discussed in view of our theoretical framework and contextualized for its implications.

1.1. Theoretical Background

Various research showed that when it comes to human social interaction, the face is a most powerful
communication channel [20,21]. Facial expressivity serves an important function in communication as
it enables the interaction partner to quickly infer information about the sender [22,23]. Through facial
expressions, affective and emotional states are communicated, which have been extensively studied in
interpersonal communication in psychology as well as with virtual characters or avatars [21,24—26].
For example, after morphing the smile of the sender onto his or her avatar, the receivers of an
avatar with a bigger smile than its user originally had, described the interaction experience with
more positive affect and more social presence than in the ‘normal’ condition [27]. A recent review
of computer-mediated communication (CMC) research on avatars asserts that an avatar’s qualities
and features are derived from behavioral realism such as appropriate facial expressions, among
others [28]. Combined, results suggest that communicating affective and emotional states through
facial expressions improves human-machine interaction.

Like Broadbent [9], we believe that affective and emotional responsiveness is quintessential to
human-robot communication, for example, by providing social robots with ‘a life of their own’ and by
making them emotionally ‘expressive’ [12,29]. For example, humanlike perceptual capacities would
support humanlike communication, such as providing robots with human functionalities to produce
and recognize facial expressions, gestures, sounds and words, and interpret and respond to these
as in social communication [14,30]. Today, many social robots are equipped with such capacities
and are increasingly optimized for social interaction, although speech technologies and autonomous
conversations are still a challenge [31,32]. Today’s humanlike robots compete in their facial articulacy,
such as Nadine [33], Jia Jia [34], Erica [35], and Sophia [36]). They illustrate how designers strive to come
close to the feel of human-human-communication in which facial look-alike plays an essential role
in developing life-like humanoid social robots. A study comparing facial expressions of robot heads
with human facial expressions found that the intended expressions in robot faces were adequately
recognized [37]. To create the feel of humanlike communication, the face plays a fundamental role and
communicates the emotional or affective state of the interlocutor. However, systematic studies testing
such assumptions by the affective responsiveness of users are scarce in current robotic research.

Facial expressions are a primary means of conveying social information and observing another’s
facial expression is essential in evoking an emotional and empathetic response [38-41]. Because
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 3 of 17

empathy underlies adequate social communication [42-44], it may help if a robot can raise empathy in
its human users. Previous research investigated whether humans feel empathy for social robots in
similar ways as they do for human beings when in pain [45,46]. These studies, however, did not include
facial expressions of humanoid robots. Rosenthal-von der Piitten’s study [45] compared a human
dressed in black and filmed from the back with Pleo, a baby toy-animal robot. Suzuki's study [46]
compared cutting a human finger versus a robot finger with a knife. Therefore, the current study
uniquely focused on the face and compared two types of humanoid robots that differed in level of
facial articulacy with a human actor. Both the robots and human were filmed from the front, torsos
only (see Method).

The question of affective involvement of users is considered a central issue in social robotics
research [13,14]. If robots have a facially detailed humanlike face, this may help to transfer emotional
responsiveness and empathy. Generally, researchers assume that emotional responsiveness contributes
to humanness and in lack thereof, even an actual human being will be considered ‘less human,’ ‘not
humane,’ and ‘robotic’ [47]. However, uncertainty exists to the extent that a robot should look like a
human. On the one hand, research indicates that emotionally expressive and understanding robots
are considered more trustworthy and warmly [48], and facilitate social interaction [30]. On the other
hand, research found that in certain emotionally sensitive cases, users may prefer the robot [49].
Proponents of the Uncanny valley [41,50] even suggest that when a robot approaches but does not
achieve human-like perfection, the earlier built up familiarity with and affinity toward the robot
is negatively affected [51,52]. However, robot design studies highlight the impact of mechanical
limitations in the face of a robot [53], and [54] for example, showed the incapability of a robot to
reproduce the emotions of ‘fear’ and ‘disgust’ due to a lack of actuators in the face and the thickness of
the silicon skin.

Whether robots are designed as more humanlike or mechanical, we argue that when a humanoid
robot evokes emotional responsiveness in the user, the cognitive notions of ‘it is just a robot’ will
become less salient. This can be explained from the way affect-based information is processed in the
human brain. In line with current neuropsychological theorizing [55-57], we propose a dynamically
intertwined parallel processing model [58,59] for interaction with social robots. Hence, elaborated
in the following, we argue that robots capable of eliciting affective responsiveness are particularly
promising in being ‘taken for real’, i.e., as a synthetic communication partner that feels like a human
conversation partner.

The brain processes emotional or affective information through complementary routes, indicated
as lower and higher pathways referring to the location in the brain areas [60-62]. The lower pathway
reflects the fast processing of feelings and emotions associated with affective engagement, sensations,
and arousing information, for example, in detecting a threat. It instigates an instantaneous response.
This is often considered intuitive, automatic, or subconscious. The higher pathway is relatively slower
and more reflective, reappraising the incoming information, regulating emotions as well as reflecting on
ongoing processes in the lower pathway. Although the lower and higher pathways are debated in the
literature, neuroscientists do acknowledge the relatively slower and faster processes that dynamically
interact as one system [55,63]. Herein, the architecture for emotions is more about “process” and less
about structure [57].

We interpret such parallel processing as occurring through coordinated networks of rapid support
signals from lower-order thalamic inputs that coalesce with more sophisticated processing systems
of the cortex [59]. This may include the processing of prediction errors, yet both types of input are
ultimately processed by cortical circuits in the cerebral cortex [50-63]. Consequently, the higher and
lower pathways should merely be seen as metaphors for the relatively slower and faster intertwined
neural processing.

For example, an initial threat-avoidant response may be reappraised in realizing that the apparent
threat was not real (e.g., when the initially felt shock was evoked by a horror movie). Such parallel
and dynamically intertwined processing can explain why people may initially feel a fictional, virtual,
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 4 of 17

or robotic encounter as real, or take information from media as real—because ‘it just feels real’ [59,64].
Several neural structures are (unconsciously) active during emotional face processing, even if that
face is artificial [65]. Dependent on the strength of processing the information via the more effortful
cognitive processes (‘higher pathway’), an individual may reappraise the interaction as ‘non-human’ in
hindsight. The emotional response seems to blur the borders between ‘fact and fake.’ The instantaneous
response based on emotional or accompanying sensory feedback apparently takes (momentary) control
precedence over cognitive reflection and biases subsequent information processing [58,59]. People
may differ highly in this respect, which might be dependent on how they process affective or
emotion-arousing content.

Applied to interacting with a social robot that elicits emotional responsiveness, the knowledge
that one is interacting with a humanoid robot rather than a real human being may withdraw to the
background and renders the interaction more (psychologically) real [66-68]. A humanlike social robot
may then more easily resemble natural-appearing social qualities. Thus, if human resemblance of a
robot may already instigate processing this ‘artificial other’ as if it were a real human being at the
intuitive level (i.e., ‘lower pathway’), this will then facilitate social interaction. ‘Forgetting’ then, that it
is just a robot may raise empathy in the observer when the robot is maltreated or lead the observer to
project feelings or attribute emotions to the robot when ‘it is in pain’ [69]. Obviously, a robot cannot
feel pain, yet, this knowledge momentarily has disappeared into the background and is overruled by
the emotional or affective responsiveness that takes control precedence [59]. Greater facial plasticity in
social robots may therefore help to instigate such an instantaneous emotional responsivity, in particular
because the face is essential in human-human communication, as argued above.

1.2. The Current Study and Hypotheses

The current study focused on how users respond to humanoid robots and extends prior work by
investigating emotional responsiveness to different levels of a robot's facial articulacy as compared to
a human’s face. Based on the above review of the literature, we argue that greater plasticity in the
robot's face will instigate affective responses that resemble human-human communication. However,
such look-alike responsiveness may differ in intensity according to the robot’s facial articulacy. The
following hypotheses guide our research:

Hypothesis 1. Greater plasticity in the robot's face elicits responses that more closely resemble human-to-human
responsiveness, resulting in higher levels of emotional responsiveness, corresponding to the portrayed emotion.

Hypothesis 2. This holds in particular when the social entity (human/humanoid robot) ts ‘in pain’ or maltreated,
resulting in higher levels of empathy in the observer.

Hypothesis 3. People maintain human schemata in attributing emotions to humanoid robots in a similar way
as they do toward humans, in particular upon maltreatment, resulting in intensities corresponding to the facial
articulacy.

These hypotheses were tested in an experimental design for differences in responses to variations
in detailed facial articulacy of two humanoid robots and a human face. Human and robots were treated
either in a harmful or in a friendly way to provide the assumed emotional context to the observer.

2. Materials and Method

2.1. Participants and Design

Participants were adults (N = 265; M = 31.5; SD = 12.7; 47% male) who were recruited voluntarily
in waiting rooms and the library and completed the study on a tablet of the research assistant.
Furthermore, a link was posted on various platforms online to reach a wide sample. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board. Participants provided informed consent upon starting
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 5 of 17

the questionnaire. About one third (33.3%) of participants followed vocational training or professional
education and 22.8% completed or followed university level. Participants were randomly assigned to
conditions. The three-leveled experimental factor ‘social entity’ contrasted the two humanoid robots
and the human. Each of them was presented in various conditions of maltreatment, accompanied by
facial expressions of ‘being in pain’ versus being cuddled and treated affectionately. Thus, the design
was a 3 (facial articulacy: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially static robot) by 2 (treatment:
affectionate vs. maltreated) between-subjects design. The dependent variables were levels of observers’

emotional responsiveness, empathy, and emotion attribution (i.e., projection of emotions onto the
social entity).

2.2. Materials

Facial articulacy was varied by a human actress versus two different humanoid robots: a 60 cm
tall Robokind “Alice” with a flexible face (designed with Hanson’s Frubber™) versus the facially
static “Nao,” 57 cm tall (SoftBank; in the study named “Zora” (i.e., female)) (Figure 1). The emotional
expressions were created by treating each of them in two different ways: A nice friendly way (e.g., being
caressed, hugged, massaged) versus maltreatment (e.g., strangulation, suffocation, being slapped).
Each treatment consisted of six actions, creating 12 variations of emotional expressivity (6 X pleasant vs.
6 X expressions of ‘in pain’), the same for each of the three social entities. To secure identical stimulus
presentations, treatments were recorded, resulting in six video clips, one for each condition. Each clip

briefly showed the six faces within one condition, each clip lasting for 1 min (images for conditions are
provided in Appendix A).

2.3. Measures

All dependent measures were 5-point Likert type scales (1 = not (agree); 5 = (agree) a lot) to allow
for reporting various intensities of emotional responsiveness and comparable answers for each item.

Emotional responsiveness was measured by asking participants how they felt watching the clip.
Participants responded through the positive and negative affect scale (PANAS) [70], consisting of 20
items: 10 negative feelings (e.g., scared, afraid, upset, distressed, guilty) and 10 positive feelings (e.g.,
enthusiastic, interested, alert, strong, excited). Cronbach’s « = 0.88.

Empathy (i.e., state empathy) was measured through combining items from Rosenthal-von der
Piitten et al. [45] and several items added from other scales to create a wider coverage of the concept
(all items in Appendix B). In all, these were 14 items (e.g., compassion, sympathy, feeling with,
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 6 of 17

feeling sorry). A principal component analysis showed two underlying dimensions that were highly
correlated and therefore treated as one scale for the current study (Appendix B). After reverse-coding
the contra-indicative items (negatively loading in Appendix B), Cronbach's « = 0.83.

Attribution of feelings was measured with a variety of six items [cf. 44,45]: ‘X was in pain”; “X felt
pleasure” (R); “X felt relaxed” (R); “X felt afraid”; “X suffered”; “X felt sad.” A higher score indicated
stronger projection of negative feelings onto the social entity. Cronbach’s « = 0.72.

Demographic measures were age, gender, level of education.

3. Results

Results of a two-way MANOVA with ‘facial articulacy’ (3 levels) and ‘treatment’ (2 levels) as
independent factors and emotional responsiveness (positive and negative scales), empathy, and attribution of
emotions as dependent variables, showed main effects for both factors, Wilk’s A = 0.79, F (2,258) = 33.57,
p < 0.001; Np = 0.21. Main effects occurred both for type of treatment, F (3,257) = 130.32, p < 0.001;
Np = 0.603 and type of facial articulacy, F (6,514) = 4.69, p < 0.001; Np = 0.052. A significant interaction
effect was also found, F (6,514) = 5.72, p < 0.001; Ny = 0.063.

Posthoc analyses of emotional responsiveness revealed that the participants reported more positive
feelings (for themselves) after the pleasant treatment (M = 25.53, SD = 8.16) than after the maltreatment
(M = 19.20, SD = 6.75), F (1,259) = 22.32, p < 0.001; N= 0.08, which is in accordance with expectations.
These differences were found for both robots Alice (Ma = 5.39, p = 0.001) and Nao/Zora (Ma = 4.42,
p = 0.005), and for the human (Ma= 3.2, p = 0.05). Participants felt more negative emotions after
the maltreatment (M = 19.92, SD = 8.02) than after the friendly treatment (M = 15.19, SD = 6.33),
F (1,259) = 28.12, p < 0.001; N= 0.10. These differences were significant for Alice and the human, but
for Nao/Zora, this effect was only marginally significant, F (1,84) = 3.35, p = 0.071; Np = 0.038. Figure 2
highlights the most relevant differences. Table 1 reports the details of these results.

Thus, for either a human or a robot, participants’ emotional responsiveness was in accordance
with how the social entity was treated, with maltreatment raising more negative feelings and a
friendly treatment more positive emotional responsiveness. The results support our hypothesis 1
in that greater plasticity in the robot’s face (Alice) elicited responses that more closely resembled
human-to-human responsiveness, resulting in higher levels of emotional responsiveness, corresponding
to the portrayed emotion.

3.1. Empathy

Posthoc analyses showed a significant main effect for the factor facial articulacy, F (2,259) =
8.45, p < 0.001, Ny = 0.06, with the participants’ empathetic responses being highest for the human
(M = 3.24, SD = 0.90), followed by empathy for Alice (M = 2.93, SD = 0.71) and for Nao/Zora (M = 2.86,
SD = 0.76), regardless of the treatment condition. The type of treatment also differed significantly for
the participants’ empathetic responses, F (1,259) = 110.56, p < 0.001; Np = 0.30, with higher levels of
empathy for the maltreatment condition (M = 3.44, SD = 0.81) than for the pleasant treatment (M = 2.56,
SD = 0.54), regardless of social entity. A significant interaction effect also was found, F (2,259) = 9.22,
p < 0.001; Np = 0.07, indicating that a harmful treatment raised most empathy compared to a friendly
treatment, more so for the human but also for each of the robots (higher than the midpoint of the scale).
However, the level of empathy was significantly higher for the human compared to each of the robots
(i.e., Ma Alice = 0.69, p < 0.001; Ma Nao = 0.72, p < 0.001). See Figure 3.

Thus, the results partly support our hypothesis 2 in that greater plasticity in the face (i.e., the
human) upon maltreatment (i.e., expressivity upon being strangled, suffocated, etc.) elicited the highest
level of empathy in the observer. The empathetic responses toward the robots, in particular upon
maltreatment, resembled human-to-human responsiveness in that empathy of the robots was felt in
moderate intensity (beyond the midpoint of the scale). However, the observers’ level of empathy did
not significantly differ for the two robots (when analyzed together with the human).

3.2. Attribution of Feelings

Posthoc analyses showed a significant main effect of type of treatment on attribution of feelings
to the social entity, F (1,259) = 236.69, p < 0.001; Ny = 0.60, indicating that the participants attributed
significantly more negative feelings to the social entity after the harmful treatment than after the
friendly treatment. The main effect for social entity, however, was not significant but the interaction was
significant, F (2,259) = 14.41, p < 0.001; Np = 0.10. Hence, participants’ attribution of feelings differed for
the human and robots depending on the type of treatment: Attribution of feelings in the maltreatment
condition differed significantly between the human and the robots (see Figure 4). The human being was
considered to be ‘in pain’ and ‘unhappy’ the most (M = 4.50, SD = 0.12, p = 0.01), followed by feelings
attributed to Alice, which were more unhappy and ‘in pain’ than feelings attributed to Nao/Zora
(i.e., Alice: M = 3.99, SD = 0.12; Nao: M = 3.67, SD = 0.12; p = 0.049). Thus, for the maltreatment
condition, results support hypothesis 3: Participants projected feelings onto robots as they do to a
human in accordance with the treatment and in higher intensities to the entity with higher facial
articulacy. Particularly during maltreatment, the levels of attributed emotions followed the level of
facial expressiveness: highest for the human, then Alice, and least so for Nao/Zora.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

The aim of the current study was to investigate emotional responsiveness to different levels of a
robot’s facial articulacy as compared to a human’s face. We created variations in detailed facial articulacy
of two humanoid robots and a human actress, who were treated either in a harmful or affectionate way.
We expected that observers’ emotional responsiveness, in terms of feeling for, empathizing with, and
attributing feelings to a humanoid robot, would generally resemble human-human communication.
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 9 of 17

Furthermore, we expected that more detailed facial articulacy would correspondingly affect participants’
emotional responsiveness.

Results showed that participants did respond emotionally and showed empathy toward both
robots and also endowed them with emotions, yet less intense than they did toward the human.
Furthermore, responses to the robots were in accordance with general expectations for humans who are
maltreated and ‘in pain,’ raising in the observer more intense levels of negative emotions, empathy, and
‘feeling sorry’ than a positive and friendly treatment. Results further indicated stronger responsiveness
toward more detailed articulacy in the robot's face (i.e., robot Alice) for some types of emotional
responsiveness, in particular when the robot was maltreated. Particularly when maltreated, people
attributed the robot with ‘feeling pain,’ intensities following its facial articulacy. Thus, people do
respond affectively to humans and robots alike, particularly so when maltreated, and less so if the robot
has limited facial expressions (i.e., more so if they are more like us). This is a first experimental study
that directly compared facial articulacy of humanoid robots to a human in affecting users’ emotional
responsiveness, showing that detailed facial articulacy does make a difference.

Our findings support and further extend previous work. The finding that people do respond
affectively to humans and robots supports the idea of CASA and Media Equation that people apply
similar schemata in computer-mediated communication, here human-robot communication, as in
human-human-communication [15,17,68]. We found this specifically for users’ emotional responses to
humanoid robots. We also saw that this only goes so far: Humans evoke more affective responses than
robots do and less expressive robots exert less intense responses.

In line with previous research, our findings show that people empathize with robots in similar
ways as they do with humans. Yet, although empathy toward the robots was beyond the midpoint
of the scale, which is remarkable in itself, it was on a lower level than for the human actress. These
results are in line with the neuropsychological findings of Suzuki et al. [46], showing that participants
responded empathetically to humans as well as to robots whose fingers were cut, yet the intensity was
lower for the robot. Therefore, we do not conclude that empathy and emotional responsiveness is the
same for human and robot—although both were felt sorry for.

This is different from the Media Equation on which the study of Rosenthal-von der Piitten et al. [45]
was based. In not finding differences between the human and the robot condition, they concluded
for sameness. However, similar responsiveness and “comparable activation patterns” [45] cannot be
deduced from a lack of effect [71], which moreover may be due to a lack of overall power. Furthermore,
the robot in [45] was not a humanoid but represented an animal (Pleo) and the video clips in [45], as in
Suzuki et al. [46], did not show suffering faces. This may also explain why no significant differences in
empathy were found in those studies.

Whereas Suzuki et al. [46] found lower intensities for affective responses to robots, our study shows
that higher facial plasticity positively modulates that effect. In line with our theoretical arguments in the
Introduction of this paper, the levels of attributed emotions followed the level of facial expressiveness:
highest for the human, then for facially articulate Alice, and least so for facially static Nao/Zora. Our
study shows that in human-robot communication, a robot's facial articulacy apparently enables the
human partner to infer information about the sender [22,23], even if that sender is artificial. This is in
accordance with human-human communication [38,39,41]. By attributing feelings onto the robots in
accordance with their facial articulacy, the observers apparently inferred its affective and emotional
states. Such affective processes, like empathy, support adequate social communication [42-44] and
facilitate social interaction [30,48], also with a robot. In [12] as well, a robot with a more humanlike
face display was perceived to have more mind and a better personality.

We also obtained indirect evidence for our notion of parallel processing of human-robot
communication based on the neuropsychological processing of affective and emotional information,
outlined in the Introduction. In communication, facial expressiveness serves to infer emotional states,
among other things. Even if a face is artificial, several neural structures are active during processing of
the ‘emotional’ face [65]. As said, the brain processes emotional, sensory, and affective information
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 10 of 17

though coordinated networks of rapid support signals from lower-order thalamic inputs that coalesce
with more sophisticated processing in the cerebral cortex [55-59]. These reflect relatively faster
and slower processes, respectively, which dynamically interact as one system [55,59,63]. Hence, we
argue that robots eliciting affective responsiveness easily are ‘taken for real,’ that is, as a synthetic
communication partner that feels like a human conversation partner.

By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive reflections of ‘it is just a robot’ become less
salient. This is a key notion in our dynamically intertwined parallel processing theory of media to
explain the natural feel of communicating with humanlike robots, based on current neuropsychological
evidence [59]. In attributing feelings to the robots, such as pain and sadness when maltreated, the
observer still may be aware that s/he observes a robot, knowing that a robot does not feel pain. However,
this awareness is backgrounded because emotional responsiveness may take control precedence over
ongoing higher order processes. The emotional response seems to blur the borders between ‘fact
and fake.” Thus, a robot’s greater facial plasticity seems to instigate an instantaneous emotional
responsivity, in particular when treated harmfully. In hindsight, the user may reappraise the interaction
as ‘non-human’ and report on the robotic nature. Future research should further test this theorizing, for
example, through neuropsychological research. Individual differences in how people process affective
or emotion-arousing encounters with robots then also could be studied.

As a limitation, we should mention that using a video study can sort effects different from actual
human-robot interactions. However, in conducting this type of research, it would be very hard to
compare a human confederate with a robot in actual presence. The robot can repeat precisely the same
act over and over again, whereas a human would hardly be capable of delivering the same performance
across participants. This is even harder if that confederate has to act in different ways (e.g., acting
happy vs. sad). Therefore, Woods, Walters, Koay, and Dautenhahn [72] recommend the use of video
clips in cases where interaction is low, such as ours. Videotaped materials can be repeated multiple
times without changing the contents and have been successfully applied in various human-robot
studies [45,49]. Nevertheless, future research is required to further unravel the differences between
video and actual interaction with a robot.

One could also counter that in general, Alice resembled the human actress relatively more than
Nao/Zora, which could have influenced the results. Nonetheless, we did find that responses to the
more humanoid robot more closely resembled responses to the human, at higher levels of emotional
responsiveness, and in line with the portrayed emotion. It is most likely that this was caused by the
ereater plasticity of Alice’s face, probably precisely because her face looked more human.

For communicative purposes, it may be helpful that users can relate to a robot in ways we
normally do in face-to-face communication. Affective involvement is considered central in social
robotics research [13,14] and research showed that robots were more easily accepted when the user
attributed ‘a mind’ to the robot [7,73]. These results bring about important knowledge for understanding
human-robot communication as well as for the design and implementation of social robots in various
walks of life. This also draws attention to how the humanoid faces are made and the importance of the
materials and actuators [53]. In the not-too-distant future, social robots may be colleagues at work:
Social robots are successful at autism therapy [74], they receive guests in the waiting area, help at hotel
desks, work as museum guides, and entertain in theme parks [9]. They accompany senior citizens in
elder homes [75], help them to live longer independently [76], and serve as tutors at schools [8].

Depending on the different social roles that a robot may take and different tasks, the robot may
need more or less facial plasticity and human likeness to communicate effectively. For example, more
facial articulacy may support the feel of companionship for lonely people [66] whereas in acquiring
school tasks, too much expressiveness of the robot might be distracting [10,77]. Furthermore, a robot
that needs help appears more acceptable than a robot that takes control [76]. Additionally, in certain
situations a less expressive robot may be preferred in a clear-cut information-transmission task than
an all too expressive human [49]. Therefore, different types of tasks, roles and functions for which
the robot is designed may require different communicative features of the robot partner. Interestingly,
Robotics 2020, 9, 92 11 of 17

oftentimes we may require such flexibility in human colleagues, yet the promising feature of humanoid
robots is that we can shape their communicative skills in conjunction with the task we design them for.

In conclusion, the current study proposed a theoretical framework that contextualizes and explains
the observers’ emotional responsiveness to humanoid robots. The results supported and extended
previous research in showing that facial articulacy of robots elicits emotional responsiveness in the
observer in similar (but not same) ways as in human-human-communication. The intensity of such
emotional responsiveness is in accordance with the level of articulacy of the robot’s face, in particular
when maltreated. When robots are designed for communicative purposes, for example, in healthcare,
education, or professional service, the robot may have a face that shows emotionality, enabling users to
affectively relate to the robot to a level appropriate to the task or goal. If the aim is to stimulate social
interaction, robot’s facial expressiveness may facilitate the intuitive processing of the ‘artificial other’
as if it were just ‘another human being.’ By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive awareness
of ‘it is just a robot’ fades into the background and seems not relevant anymore.
