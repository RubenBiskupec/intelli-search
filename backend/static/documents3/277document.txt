- coe or eewone The transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a kind of sudden disease, which has the char-
University, Shaanxi, acteristics of short duration and high frequency. Since most patients can return to

Xian 710071, China normal after the onset of the disease, it is often neglected. Medical research has proved
ru tisy 01 autor information that patients are prone to stroke in a relatively short time after the transient ischemic
article attacks. Therefore, it is extremely important to effectively monitor transient ischemic

attack, especially for elderly people living alone. At present, video monitoring and
wearing sensors are generally used to monitor transient ischemic attacks, but these
methods have certain disadvantages. In order to more conveniently and accurately
monitor transient ischemic attack in the indoor environment and improve risk man-
agement of stroke, this paper uses a microwave sensing platform working in C-Band
(4.0 GHz-8.0 GHz) to monitor in a non-contact way. The platform first collects data,
then preprocesses the data, and finally uses principal component analysis to reduce
the dimension of the data. Two machine learning algorithms support vector machine
(SVM) and random forest (RF) are used to establish prediction models respectively. The
experimental results show that the accuracy of SVM and RF approaches are 97.3% and
98.7%, respectively; indicating that the scheme described in this paper is feasible and
reliable.

Introduction

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient neurological disorder caused by focal
ischemia of the brain or retina without acute infarction. The clinical symptoms usually
last less than 1 hour and the neurological function can return to normal after the onset
[1]. TIA is characterized by sudden onset, short duration and high frequency of attack.
Currently, the causes of TIA are generally recognized by the medical community as
follows :(1) Embolus in arterial blood flows into the brain, resulting in blockage and
poor circulation of blood. (2) When blood pressure fluctuates, especially when blood
pressure drops, the blood flow in the distal part of the brain’s smaller blood vessels
decreases. (3) Changes in blood composition cause blood clots to form in blood ves-
sels, which can block blood vessels in the brain [2] [3]. Relevant clinical experimental
data show that TIA has an early warning effect on stroke. After TIA, the incidence of

stroke within 48 h is as high as 50%, and the incidence of stroke within 3 months is
10%-—20% [4]. Every year, there are many old people living alone in the world who do
not receive effective attention and timely treatment when suffering from TIA, result-
ing in a subsequent stroke or even death. Some literatures also give other aspects of
TIA [5-7], indicating the necessity of monitoring TIA at early stage [8].

The main symptom of TIA is that the patient suddenly falling down due to the
weakness of both legs, accompanied by vertigo or vomiting, especially when he sud-
denly gets up after sitting or lying for a long time [9]. For patients with TIA, early
treatment should be given to quickly rule out bleeding in the brain or seizures.

At present, various advanced methods and technologies have been used in the dis-
eases prediction and healthcare fields, including acceleration sensors [10], cameras
[11], Multiple GPUs [12], Accounting for Label Uncertainty in Machine Learning [13],
machine intelligence [14], mobile healthcare framework [15], deep learning approach
[16], system in Internet of Medical Things [17], predictive analytics [18] and cloud
computing environment [19]. All these significant contributions show their advantage
and great usefulness.

In this work, the authors develop a wireless sensing platform (WSP), which is com-
posed of a transmitter and a receiver and this platform also has its unique advantage.
It can be installed indoors without any contact with patients. The working process of
the WSP is as follows: the transmitter transmits the electromagnetic wave in the C
band, the receiver receives the wireless signal and simultaneously extracts the wireless
channel state information (CSI) data and saves them. Firstly, we conducted a series
of preprocessing on the collected CSI data, including removal of outliers and signal
denoising, and then used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimen-
sionality of the preprocessed data [20]. Finally, two machine learning algorithms, sup-
port vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) [21, 22], were used to classify,
so as to monitor TIA. The experimental results in this paper show that the accuracy
of the two machine learning algorithms can reach over 95%, which proves that the
method described in this paper can effectively monitor TIA, so as to reduce the life
risk of the elderly living alone.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. It is proposed for the first time to monitor TIA by using C-band wireless sensing
technology, which avoids the additional burden of wearable devices of monitored
objects and does not invade their privacy;

2. Two kinds of machine learning algorithms are used to train the prediction model to
increase the stability and accuracy of the prediction results;

3. Our self-developed WSP has the advantages of low cost, convenient and fast.

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In the second part, we will introduce the
principle of C-Band wireless sensing technology in detail, and the third part will describe
the experimental scheme. In the fourth part, we will preprocess the experimental data
and classify them by the machine learning algorithms. Experimental results will be dis-
cussed in the fifth part, and finally, we summarize the article in the sixth part.

Principle of C-band wireless sensing technology
Wireless signal propagation model
C band has been included in the official document of the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology of the People’s Republic of China; in addition, the usage of
this band is also recommended by the microwave stations within the Chinese terri-
tory. C-Band wireless signal has the characteristics of light like scattering and line-of-
sight (LOS) propagation. In the process of propagation, it is easy to be interfered with
space environment and appear fading, so that the electromagnetic wave propagating
in different paths shows different amplitudes and phases at the receiving end, result-
ing in multipath effect [23]. The indoor propagation model of C-Band signal is shown
in Fig. 1.

According to Fries transfer formula [24], the power of the receiving antenna can be

expressed as:

p= P,G,G,A2

(4st R)? ()

where P;, P, are the power of transmitting antenna and receiving antenna respectively.
G;, G; are the gain of transmitting antenna and receiving antenna respectively, 1 is the
wavelength of wireless signal, and R is the distance between the two antennas.
According to Fig. 1, we assume that the distance of the wireless signal reflected
through the ceiling and the ground is D, and the distance scattered by the human

body is H, then (1) can be rewritten as:

P,G,G,A2

P, = — 2
" 1672(R + D +H)? (2)

According to (2), when there is no moving object on the signal transmission path,
R, D and H remain unchanged, and the power of the receiving antenna P, is stable.
When an object moves in the path of signal transmission, H will change, resulting in
a change in the received power, that is, the amplitude and phase of the received signal
will change. The different amplitude and phase of the received signal contains rich

information about the external environment. By processing of the received signal, we

can extract the change information of the external environment from the received

signal, so as to achieve the purpose of monitoring.

Channel information

The C-Band WSP used in this paper adopts orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) technology at the transmitter. The main advantage of this technology is to improve
the data transmission efficiency and spectrum utilization, and it has a good anti-multipath
attenuation capability [25]. The platform includes: spectrum analyzer, RF generator, Cables,
vector network analyzer, antennas, absorbing material, networked computer, etc.

OFDM technology supports multi-antenna access. If MIMO-OFDM system has Nr (at
least 2) antennas at the transmitter and Np (at least 2) antennas at the receiver, the number
of OFDM subcarriers is Nc, then the channel model of wireless system can be expressed as
[26],

Y=HX+N (3)

where Y represents received signal, X represents transmitted signal, N represents ambient
noise, H represents the wireless channel state matrix, and its dimension is Nr x Nr x Nc;

as shown below,

Ay, Ho. ... Hone
H = : : : (4)

In the formula above,

Ai = [Hi (fi) Ha(fa),---» He (five) J. (5)

where f; represents the center frequency of the Kth subcarrier, and H; (fk) (1<k<WNc)
represents the frequency response of each subcarrier, which can be rewritten as,

Hx (fe) = Hy (fe) FSA GO) (6)

where H; (fk) represents CSI amplitude of the Kth subcarrier, and arg (Hx (fk) represents
CSI phase of the Kth subcarrier.

The received signal is continuously sampled in a certain period of time. Through channel
estimation [27], a series of discrete H matrices are obtained. Thus, the CSI data we need is

obtained. The channel estimation formula is as follows,

The experimental scheme

It can be seen from the first section that the obvious symptom of TIA is that the patient
suddenly falls down due to weakness of both legs. We need to distinguish TIA from
other normal daily actions. In this experiment, we will collect data of several actions as
shown in Table 1.

Before the experiment, all the subjects were informed about the matters needing
attention, on the other hand, all the subjects were trained, rigorously, about the TIA
movements simulation. The experiment was carried out in an approximate ward envi-
ronment. The size of the laboratory is 7 x 5 m. The transmitter and the receiver of
WSP are placed at both ends of the room, respectively. The object makes the actions
shown in Table 1 in the room. The experimental scene is similar to Fig. 1, and the
actual experimental scene has sofa, bookcase and other furniture. Absorbing mate-
rial will reduce the signal reflection and thus the non-line-of-sight propagation would
be affected. However, in actual application scenarios, absorbing material is seldomly
used, leading to the fact that the multipath propagation has to be taken into account.
Due to the fact that single subject was considered, monopole antennas were used in
the experiment. They transmit and receive omnidirectional EM waves and easy to
design; more complicated directional antennas can be used for some other special
environments.

The experimental flow is shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 2, the WSP is a self-designed device for monitoring TIA, which is composed
of a transmitter, a receiver and a data processing module. The transmitter works in
C-Band and adopts OFDM technology. The transmitting signal bandwidth is 40 MHz
and there are 30 subcarriers in total. At the same time, the time window is 5 s. The
receiver receives the signal, calculates the channel state matrix, and obtains the
CSI data. The data processing module first processes the CSI data, and then classi-
fies the indoor human activities through the model trained by the machine learning
algorithm, so as to achieve the purpose of monitoring. The platform is a non-contact
monitoring tool, which can be directly installed indoors, very safe and convenient.

We collected 300 samples for each action. The waveform of TIA original data col-
lected in the experiment is shown in Fig. 3.

From Fig. 3, we can see that the waveform contains a lot of burrs (noise), which
need to be processed. Next, we will describe how to process the data.

Data preprocessing

Select subcarrier

In order to eliminate redundant information and facilitate subsequent data process-
ing, we need to pick out the appropriate subcarriers. We calculate the variance of 30
subcarriers of each group of data separately. According to the principle, the larger the
variance, the larger the amount of information [28], the sequence number of subcarri-

ers selected for each action is shown in Table 2.

Remove outliers

The fluctuation of equipment voltage or other factors will cause outliers, which will
affect the subsequent data processing. We will remove the outliers according to the
Pauta criterion [29]. The original waveform of the TIA is shown in Fig. 4a, after
removing the outliers, the waveform is shown in Fig. 4b.
Zhang et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:16 Page 8 of 14

Signal filtering

Before feature extraction, we need to denoise the signal. In this paper, a wavelet trans-
form is used to filter out the signal noise [30], which is mainly based on the following
considerations: (1) wavelet transform has good time-frequency characteristics; (2)
wavelet transform can well describe the non-stationary characteristics of the signal; (3)
wavelet basis function selection is relatively flexible.

In this paper, the signal is decomposed into five layers using the “sym8” wavelet. The
Symlet wavelet function is an approximate symmetric wavelet function proposed by
Ingrid Daubechies, which is an improvement on the dB function. SimN (N=2,3....,8)
wavelet has good symmetry, which can reduce the phase distortion of signal analysis
and reconstruction to some extent [31]. The waveforms of the motion after the wavelet
transform filtering process are shown in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5 that the

signal waveform is clear and smooth.

Data classification
Feature extraction
Due to the large dimension of data, we will use PCA to reduce the dimension and extract
features. In 1901, K. Pearson proposed PCA. The idea of this method is to extract a set
of new features that are not related to each other from old features. The new features are
arranged in descending order of importance [32].

The principle of PCA is as follows,

Y = AX
(8)
where, X = (%1,%2,...,,) is the vector in the original n-dimensional feature space,
Y= (v1, 2p. 005 Yn) is a vector composed of n new features, and A is an orthogonal

transformation matrix. The new features can be expressed as follows,

nN
Vi = S aij) = a} xj(i = 1,2,...n) (9)
j=l

The larger the variance of the new feature, the greater difference in the feature of the

sample, and this feature is more important. The variance of each new feature is:
var (yi) =E 2] — E[y;]’. (10)
E[] is a mathematical expectation, combined with (2), (3) can be reduced to
var (yi) = a} Da; (11)

where » is the covariance matrix of the original eigenvector X, which can be estimated
and calculated with samples. Because A is an orthogonal matrix, so a) a; = 1. Using

Lagrange method, we can get the maximum variance value as follows,

f(a) = a! Da; — Aa} a; — 1) (12)

where A is the Lagrange multiplier, and the derivative of (5) for a; is obtained as

follows,
La; = 14; (13)
Substituting (13) into (11), we can get
var (yi) = a} Da; = ha; a; =} (14)

Combining (13) and (14), the optimal a; should be the eigenvector corresponding to
the maximum eigenvalue of X, and the corresponding y; is the first principal component,
with the largest variance. The covariance matrix & has a total of n eigenvalues, sorting
them from large to small, and then obtaining the second principal component,..., the nth
principal component. Thus, the corresponding a; is obtained, and then the orthogonal
transformation matrix A is obtained.

The proportion of information represented by the first k principal components is:

k n
P=S d/o hi (15)
i=1 i=1

As a rule of thumb, most of the information in the data is concentrated on a few prin-

cipal components. As shown in Fig. 6, we selected the first 53 principal components.

Training model

In this paper, SVM and RF are used to classify the data respectively. The basic idea of
SVM is to transform the original nonlinear problems in low-dimensional space into lin-
ear classification problems in high-dimensional space through feature transformation.
This feature transformation is realized by defining appropriate inner product kernel
functions. SVM implements different forms of nonlinear classifiers by using different
kernel functions, whose performance depends on the selection of kernel functions and
the parameter setting of kernel functions. The commonly used kernel functions are: (1)
radial basis function; (2) polynomial function; (3) Sigmoid function. Since the linear
function can only deal with the linear classification problem and the performance of the

Sigmoid function can be obtained by taking a certain parameter of the radial basis func-
tion, the radial basis function will be adopted in this paper [21] [33]. The advantages of
SVM include high precision, good theoretical guarantees on the overfitting, etc.

The idea of RF is to build many decision trees to form a “forest” and make decisions by
voting. Both theoretical and experimental studies show that this method can effectively
improve the accuracy of classification [22]. The RF in this paper has 500 decision trees.
The advantages of RF include: the resistance to over fitting, stability, etc. It is also worth
mentioning that some other advanced machine learning approaches have also been used
in the various healthcare and Internet of Things applications [34-40], which also indi-

cate the path of future research.

Results and discussion

The experimental results

The confusion matrix of the results processed by the classification algorithm is shown in
Table 3. The total number of samples for each action is 300, 225 samples are taken as the
training set and 75 samples are taken as the test set.

Discussion

1. As shown in Table 3, the accuracy of both SVM and RF is over 95%, and the errors
mainly come from static actions (standing, sitting and lying). This result can effec-
tively prove the feasibility and reliability of the method described in this paper.

2. From Table 3, we can also see that if only TIA and other actions are distinguished,
the accuracy of SVM will reach 97.3%, and the accuracy of RF will reach 98.7%.

3. It can be seen from Fig. 5a, b and c that the amplitude of static action oscillogram is
very gentle, and the differentiation is more obvious than other actions. At the same
time, it can be seen from Table 3 that static actions are only internal classification
deviation, and other actions will not be misjudged as static actions, and static actions

4. It can be seen from Fig. 5 d—g that the oscillogram of stand up, sit down, walk and
TIA all have their own characteristics. However, due to the similarity between sit
down and TIA, there will be some errors between them. From Table 3, it can be seen
that there are one or two sample classification errors in sit down and TIA.

5. In this paper, the accuracy of the RF algorithm is higher than that of the SVM algo-
rithm., so RF is more suitable algorithm for monitoring of TIA.

All the important abbreviations are summarized in the following table:

Conclusion

Monitoring TIA can make patients get timely treatment, which is helpful to prevent
patients from subsequent stroke. As far as we know, this paper is the first time to use
C-Band wireless sensing technology to monitor TIA in a non-contact way. Firstly, we
remove the outliers from the data, filter the data by wavelet transform, then reduce the
dimension of the preprocessed data by PCA, and finally train the model by SVM and RF.
The accuracy of SVM and RF approaches are 97.3% and 98.7%, respectively; demonstrat-
ing the effectiveness of the technology presented in the paper. Next, we further explore
the applications of C-Band wireless sensing technology in medical care, and propose
more reliable, safe and convenient technical application programs; the main contribu-
tion and novelty of the work lies in the development of the platform and the non-contact

disease warning in the early stage.
