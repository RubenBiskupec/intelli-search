Abstract

The dramatic advances in flexible/wearable electronics have garnered great attention for touch sensors for practical
applications in human health monitoring and human-machine interfaces. Self-powered triboelectric tactile sensors

with high sensitivity, reduced crosstalk, and simple processing routes are highly desirable. Herein, we introduce a facile
and low-cost fabrication approach for a metal-electrode free, fully integrated, flexible, and self-powered triboelectric
tactile sensor array with 8-by-8 sensor units. Through the height difference between the sensor units and interconnect

electrodes, the crosstalk derived from the electrodes has been successfully suppressed with no additional shielding

layers. The tactile sensor array shows a remarkable sensitivity of 0.063 VkPa | with a linear range from 5 to 50 kPa,

which covers a broad range of testing objects. Furthermore, due to the advanced mechanical design, the flexible
sensor array exhibits great capability of pressure sensing even under a curved state. The voltage responses from the
pattern mapping by finger touching demonstrate the uniformity of the sensor array. Finally, real-time tactile sensing
associated with light-emitting diode (LED) array lighting demonstrates the potential application of the sensor array in
position tracking, selfpowered touch screens, human-machine interfaces and many others.

sensor based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG),
with the sensing mechanism of coupling triboelectrifica-
tion**-*” and electrostatic induction”®, has aroused great
interest among researchers” **. For example, Wang et al. *”
reported a self-powered triboelectric sensor matrix com-
posed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as an electrifica-
tion layer and patterned Ag electrodes serving as charge-
sensing components and circuit connections. This sensor
matrix has a resolution of 5 dpi and a pressure sensitivity
of 0.06 kPa”' and is capable of real-time tactile mapping.
Further, the same group developed a self-powered tactile
sensor with high stretchability and transparent patterned
Ag nanofiber electrodes*”. Additionally, a graphene-based
self-powered touch sensor with atomically thin graphene
(<1 nm) as the electrode and PDMS as the electrification
layer was reported by Lee et al.°’. The auxetic mesh
design endows the touch sensor with the capability to
maintain a stable electrical output while being stretched.

These emerging triboelectric tactile sensors exhibit
attractive features; however, the fabrication processes
involve either specialized equipment or high-cost metal
electrodes, which complicates the fabrication process and
increases the cost for large-scale production. Thus, simple
fabrication and economic processes are highly desirable.
Meanwhile, hydrogel/ionogel, another promising type of
conductor owing to its merits of high conductivity,
transparency, and stretchability, has been widely explored
in applications for touch panels*’, sensors**°°, TENGs*’ >”,
and soft robotics”.

In addition, another issue generally associated with
triboelectric-type sensor arrays is the crosstalk between
sensor units as well as the electrodes*’*’, arising from
electrostatic induction, which significantly limits their
practical application for precise position identification in
response to contacting objects. Thus, great efforts have
been devoted to reducing this useless crosstalk, such as
introducing a dielectric shielding layer*’**“* or metal
screening layer*’. Nevertheless, more involved layers not
only complicate the fabrication process but also may
compromise the stretchability/flexibility of the device due to
mismatch of the elastic modulus of different layers.

Herein, to address the abovementioned issues, we pre-
sent a facile, low-cost process to fabricate a metal-elec-
trode-free, fully integrated, soft triboelectric sensor array
(ISTSA), which is composed of an elastomer (Ecoflex) as
the electrification layer and a gel state of polyvinyl alco-
hol/polyethyleneimine (PVA/PEI) sealed as the sensor
units and electrodes. In particular, without the shielding
layer, this ISTSA suppresses the crosstalk arising from the
electrodes by introducing a height difference between the
sensor units and serpentine electrodes. Based on a single-

electrode TENG mode, the output sensing signals of an
individual sensor unit regarding various contact objects,
pressure sensitivity, different mechanical stimuli, and
long-term stability were investigated. Further, the cross-
talk derived from the electrodes to the adjacent sensor
units was illustrated using real-time sensing, with the
signal-to-noise ratio larger than eight-fold. The uni-
formity of the ISTSA was demonstrated by pattern
mapping through finger touching. Finally, light-emitting
diode (LED) array lighting by touching the corresponding
sensor unit demonstrates the potential application of the
ISTSA for position tracking and human-machine
interfaces.

Results and discussion

The fabrication process of the ISTSA is schematically
illustrated in Fig. la, and details can be found in the
“Materials and methods” section. First, a template with a
designed pattern composed of 8-by-8 sensor units and
serpentine electrode lines was obtained by three-
dimensional (3D) printing (Fig. S1). Each unit has
dimensions of 5mmx5mmx5mm (length x width x
depth). The serpentine structural electrode (width of
1mm and depth of 0.6 mm) ensures the stretchability of
the ISTSA. Then, Ecoflex 00-30 or 00-50 was poured into
the template to ensure full coverage. After air-drying at
room temperature, a soft and flexible patterned elastomer
can be peeled off from the template, leaving cavities in
sensor units and serpentine lines (Figs. 1bl and b2).
Accordingly, the mixture of PVA/PEI gel was injected into
these cavities, and conductive tape was connected at each
end of the serpentine lines (Fig. 1b3). Finally, a thin layer
of Ecoflex 00-30 was poured on the plane of the filled

elastomer to seal the device. After thoroughly drying in
air, the ISTSA (10cmx10cmx0.6cm) was obtained
(Fig. 1b4) and was ready for the performance test after the
device was turned over.

Compared to a previous report with PVA/PEI film as an
ionic conductor®®, in this study, the gel-state PVA/PEI
shows a much higher ionic conductivity of 1.53 mS cm!
(Fig. S2), which renders it more efficient as a current
collector. The working mechanism of each sensor unit of
the ISTSA in the single-electrode mode under a contact-
separation cycle is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a.
When an object (taking Al as an example) is fully in
contact with one sensor unit, electrification triggers the
electrons to be injected from Al to the surface of the unit
due to the high electronegativity of silicone rubber. Once
Al begins to be withdrawn from the sensor unit, the static
negative charge on the silicone rubber will induce the
movement of ions in the unit bulk, as well as in the ser-
pentine electrode, leaving positive ions at the interface of
the elastomer/electrolyte. Meanwhile, an electrical double
layer (EDL) is formed at the conductive tape (metal)/
electrolyte interface, with the same number of negative
ions. Thus, continuous contact—separation between the

sensor unit and contact object will result in a potential
difference between the EDL and the ground, and alter-
nating current signals are generated through the external
circuit along with the formation of the EDL or neu-
tralization of the positive charges in the EDL.

To demonstrate the output characteristics of the sensor
array in terms of various sensing conditions, one individual
sensor unit was first taken for investigation.
Fig. 2b shows the output voltage of one sensor unit (5 x
5mm’) when in contact with different materials
(1 x 1cm”) under the same conditions (velocity of 1m s,
frequency of 0.65 Hz, displacement of 20 mm), such as copy
paper, metal (Cu, Al), Kapton, polycarbonate (PC), poly-
ethylene terephthalate (PET), fluorinated ethylene propy-
lene (FEP), nylon, and nitrile. The output voltage varies
greatly in the range of 2—7.1 V, among which the highest
output voltage (7.1 V) was reached by contact with PC. The
reason is that different materials have distinct electro-
negativity values due to their intrinsic properties in terms of
easy gain or loss of electrons, and according to the tribo-
electric series, different surface charge densities as well as
outputs will be generated upon contact. Thus, when a single
sensor unit is in contact with various materials, different

magnitudes of electrical responses are yielded. The results
demonstrate the potential application of the sensor array in
response to various sensing environments. To investigate
the pressure sensitivity of the ISTSA, the voltage response
while gradually increasing the applied pressure on one
sensor unit was recorded. It is notable that the output
voltage showed a positive linear correlation with increasing
contact pressure in the range of 5-50 kPa (Fig. 2c), with a
pressure sensitivity of 0.063 V kPa™', owing to the increased
surface contact area of the unit. However, further increasing
the pressure to 80 kPa caused severe compression of the
sensor unit; thus, the regain of the sensor unit together with
the retraction of the contacting object may disturb the
surface charge density, leading to a decrease in output.
Compared to a previously reported multilayer sensor
matrix®', the ISTSA exhibits a comparable pressure sensi-
tivity and sensing range. Additionally, the voltage responses
of one sensor unit of ISTSA under different input pressures
with respect to those of other contacting materials, such as
PC and FEP, were investigated, as shown in Fig. $3, where
the pressure sensitivity is 0.0294 V kPa“ for PC ina sensing
range of 5—55 kPa and 0.0318 V kPa“ for FEP in the range
of 5—75 kPa.

As is known, the electrostatic charge induced on the
elastomer surface inevitably interferes with the sensing
behavior of sensor units’. To investigate how large the
influence of each sensor unit is on the adjacent units, the
real-time output voltage of other sensor units was
recorded at the same time when one unit was touched.
Fig. 2d, e indicates the output distributions in response to
touching positions of P (4,6) (red square in inset of
Fig. 2d) and P (6,2) (red square in inset of Fig. 2e). It is
evident that the adjacent units also had electrical
responses when P (4,6) and P (6,2) were touched by a
finger. Nevertheless, the crosstalk (0.01-0.55 V) was
relatively small in comparison with the output of the
triggered sensor unit (>3.7 V) (Supporting Information,
Video 1), demonstrating the reliability of the ISTSA to
precisely identify the touching position of a contact
object. For another type of crosstalk arising from the
electrodes, a detailed discussion will be conducted later.

To further investigate the electrical output character-
istics of one sensor unit of the ISTSA in response to
various mechanical stimuli, different contact areas, dis-
placements, and frequencies of mechanical input were
evaluated when in contact with Al, as shown in Fig. 3a—e
(setup shown in Fig. $4). The output voltage increases
from 5 to 12 V when the contact area of Al increases from
1 to 4cm” under a pressure of ~50 kPa (Fig. 3a), and the
output charge follows the same trend, rising from 2 to
4.5nC (Fig. 3b). The results agreed well with previous
studies showing that an increase in the surface area results
in an enhanced surface charge and output voltage*®.
Additionally, the output of the triboelectric ISTSA has a

Page 4 of 9

relationship with the displacement between the contact
object and the sensor unit. Figure 3c presents the output
voltage, which gradually increases from ~3 to 6 V as the
displacement increases from 2 to 20mm. A _ further
increase to 50 mm brings no enhancement of the output
voltage, which means that electrons/ions in the sensor
unit have reached an equilibrium state at the displace-
ment of 20 mm. Moreover, it is found that the mechanical
input frequency also influences the output voltage and
current signals at a fixed 20-mm displacement (Fig. 3d, e).
A lower frequency (0.2 Hz) tends to exhibit full contact
between Al and the sensor unit, yielding a higher output
voltage of 6.6V and current of 91nA, while a higher
frequency (1.3—1.5 Hz) leads to a certain decrease in the
contact area, generating a relatively lower output voltage
of 5.2—5.7 V and current of 55 nA. Thus, a low-frequency
mechanical stimulus is suggested for better sensing out-
put of ISTSA. In addition, the long-term stability of the
sensor unit was tested, as shown in Fig. 3f. It is noted that
the output voltage of one sensor unit in contact with Al
has no obvious drop even after 2250 contact cycles under
a frequency of 1 Hz, demonstrating the potential for long-
term-sensing applications.

Due to the unique design of the serpentine electrodes as
well as the soft-integrated elastomer profile, the ISTSA can
feasibly perform sensing under the bending state. Fig. 3g—i
presents a comparison of the output voltage, current, and
charge of one sensor unit in a flat state (180°) and a bending
state (116.9°) (Fig. S5) upon finger touch. The overall output
is much higher than that in Fig. 3a—c because human skin
(finger) is more positive than Al according to the tribo-
electric series*’. As seen, the ISTSA generates output vol-
tage, current, and charge values of 24. V, 2.5 uA, and 9 nC,
respectively, when bent at 116.9°, while in the flat state, the
output is 22.5 V, 2.6uA, and 6.5nC. The comparable or
even higher output under the bending state is mainly due to
the enlarged surface area of the sensor unit during bending;
thus, more surface charges can be generated. This result
demonstrates the promising application of the ISTSA when
the sensing circumstance involves a certain curvature,
which indicates an advantage over other touch sensor arrays
with a hard substrate.

As discussed above, crosstalk between the sensor units
and the electrode lines is another key issue that needs to
be circumvented in order to have a sensor array capable
of precise sensing. Commonly, researchers have adopted
shielding layers to cover the electrode part to reduce or
minimize the crosstalk. For example, a conductive nickel-
deposited fabric layer was employed with a screening
effect to reduce the crosstalk*’. However, given that
adopting more layers complicates the fabrication process,
the mismatch of the elastic modulus between different
layers may cause a relative shift when the device is in a
bent state, which will affect the sensitivity of the sensor

layers, we present a facile fabrication approach that can
adequately suppress the crosstalk simply by introducing a
height difference between the sensor unit and electrode,
with 5 mm-height sensor units and 0.6-mm height elec-
trode lines. The height difference, consequently, is larger
than eight-fold. For a clear demonstration, three different
positions (Fig. 4a, d, g) were checked, and the real-time
output signals of 16 adjacent sensor units were recorded
at the same time when one position was touched by a
finger with a touching force of 1.2-1.5N and frequency
of ~1.7 Hz. (Fig. 4b, e, h). Notably, among the three

 

positions, the first touching point (Fig. 4a) showed a
relatively higher impact on the adjacent 16 sensor units,
leading to five sensor units with noise signal generation
(Fig. 4b), and the second touching point (Fig. 4d) affected
three sensor units. Additionally, at the edge of the sensor
array (the third touching point, Fig. 4g), there was a
certain impact on the sensor units but with negligible
noise (Fig. 4h). Furthermore, the sensor unit with the
highest magnitude of signal/noise output during trig-
gering by touching positions was selected from Fig. 4b, e,
and h and compared with its own signal output, as
plotted in Fig. 4c, f, and i, respectively. In this case, we

can make a thorough comparison of the signal-to-noise
ratio of one individual sensor unit. As calculated, the
signal-to-noise ratios of sensor unit 15, unit 5, and unit
11 are 8.1, 8.2, and 8.5, respectively. These values are
comparable to the height difference mentioned earlier.
The results indicate a good differentiation of the signal to

the noise and the capability of the ISTSA for valid sen-
sing, demonstrating an effective way to reduce the
crosstalk of the electrode lines.

Further, to demonstrate the uniformity and sensitivity of
the sensor array in response to a finger touch, two different
patterns depicted as “CUHK” and “ZI LAB”, as shown in
Wang et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:59

Fig. 5a and d, respectively, were touched in sequence by
fingers on two 8 x 8 sensor arrays. Accordingly, Fig. 5b and
e illustrate the associated patterns expected on the two
ISTSAs, and the actual electrical responses generated by
finger touching are ~1.2—3.6 V (Fig. 5c) for the ISTSA with
a “CUHK” pattern and 1.6—4.6 V (Fig. 5f) for the other
ISTSA with a “ZI LAB” pattern. The small fluctuations in
the voltage responses indicate not only the uniformity of
the sensor units within one ISTSA but also the reprodu-
cibility between the ISTSAs. In addition, the output voltage
signals of eight sensor units of one ISTSA in a diagonal
position are shown in Fig. S6. The difference in the
responses is mainly due to the different lengths (resis-
tances) of the serpentine lines.

Finally, we demonstrate a practical application of the
ISTSA by lighting up an LED array through gentle touching
of the corresponding sensor unit by a finger. Three sensor
units, as examples, with their associated LED lighting at the
positions of P (6,1), P (2,3), and P (2,6), are shown in Fig. S7
(Supporting Information, Video 2). The real-time LED
lighting of the ISTSA by finger touching shows its pro-
mising application in position tracking.

Conclusion

In summary, we present a fully polymer-integrated tribo-
electric tactile sensor array (8 x 8) without a metal electrode
through a facile and low-cost fabrication process. The sensor

unit shows a pressure sensitivity of 0.063 VkPa™' in the

range of 5-50 kPa and is sensitive to various contact objects
as well as capable of sensing under a bending state. The
crosstalk arising from the electrodes is successfully sup-
pressed by introducing an eight-fold height difference
between the sensor units and electrodes, resulting in a
signal-to-noise ratio larger than eight. In addition, small
fluctuations in the voltage responses in pattern mapping by
finger touching indicate the uniformity of the sensor array.
Finally, the self-powered ISTSA is demonstrated for real-
time LED lighting by finger touching, which shows its pro-
mising application in position tracking, human—machine
interfaces, and wearable electronics.

Materials and methods
Fabrication of the soft integrated tactile sensor array
(ISTSA)

The ISTSA was fabricated by a template-assisted
method (Fig. 1). In detail, a template with patterns was
3D printed with detailed dimensions, and the digital
photograph is shown in Fig. $1. Then, Ecoflex 00-30/00-
50 (Smooth-on, USA) rubbers were mixed thoroughly
with A:B by the same weight and poured into the tem-
plate to ensure full coverage, followed by degassing
under vacuum, and were dried at room temperature.
Then, a flexible Ecoflex rubber mold can be peeled off
from the template. The second step was to assemble the
Wang et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:59

electrode, where instead of a metal electrode, an ionic
conductor composed of a mixture of PVA (Mowiol” 10-
98, My: ~61,000, Sigma-Aldrich) and PEI (My: ~25,000,
Sigma-Aldrich) was employed using a modified recipe as
reported previously*®. The volume ratio of PVA to PEI
was 10 to 1 to enhance the ionic conductivity. Accord-
ingly, the mixture was injected into the cavities of the
mold (both sensor units and serpentine lines). Con-
ductive tape was connected at each end of the serpentine
lines for electrical measurement. The last step was
sealing the ISTSA. The well-mixed Ecoflex 00-30 (parts
A and B with the same weight ratio) was degassed under
vacuum in advance and poured on the plane of the mold
to fully cover the sensor units and serpentine lines and
left to dry in air at room temperature. Consequently, an
ISTSA was finally obtained.

Characterization and measurement

The ionic conductivity of the PVA/PEI was measured by
a Eutech PC 700 Meter (Thermo Scientific). The electrical
output (voltage, current, and charge) of a single sensor
unit was measured by a Keithley 6514 programmable
electrometer. The real-time signal sensing was recorded
by a DAQ system (PowerLab 16/35, ADInstruments)
equipped with 16 input channels with an internal resis-
tance of 1 MQ.
