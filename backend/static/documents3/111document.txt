Abstract

Oil leakage between the slipper and swash plate of an axial piston pump has a significant effect on the efficiency of
the pump. Therefore, it is extremely important that any leakage can be predicted. This study investigates the leakage,
oil film thickness, and pocket pressure values of a slipper with circular dimples under different working conditions.
The results reveal that flat slippers suffer less leakage than those with textured surfaces. Also, a deep learning-based

framework is proposed for modeling the slipper behavior. This framework is a long short-term memory-based deep
neural network, which has been extremely successful in predicting time series. The model is compared with four

conventional machine learning methods. In addition, statistical analyses and comparisons confirm the superiority of
the proposed model.

1 Introduction

Axial piston pumps are frequently used in hydraulic
applications which require high pressures. In the axial
piston pump shown in Figure 1, one of the most impor-
tant locations for metal-metal contact is between the
slipper and the swash plate.

This friction couple is lubricated hydrodynamically/
hydrostatically depending on the piston geometry and
the slipper pocket ratio, and the forces on the piston
are balanced on this surface. The texture of the surface,
however, directly affects the performance of the tribo-
logical surfaces which function through lubrication. Nev-
ertheless, obtaining the optimum surface texture design
depends heavily on the geometry and the working con-
ditions of the surfaces. Additionally, oil can be retained
on these surfaces, and the resulting contamination can be
maintained in the pits on the surface, thus extending the
life of the mechanical parts [1].

A multitude of studies on the surface of hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic bearings have been conducted over the
past 30 years, including analytical, experimental, numeri-
cal, and artificial intelligence investigations. For example,
Koc et al. [2, 3] proposed that the slipper should have a
small convex surface to enable successful performance,
whereas Bergada et al. [4, 5] conducted an analytical
study to understand the lifting property and leakage of
a slipper containing a number of grooves. These grooves
on the slipper change the pressure distribution, leak-
age, and lifting force acting on the slipper. Etsion et al.
[6] considered a textured surface for the parallel thrust
bearing, and observed that the friction coefficient was
lower in partially textured bearings. Sharma et al. [7]
performed numerical simulations for fully and partially
textured thrust pad bearings with different lubricants,
and reported that micro-surface textures cause slight
changes in load-bearing capacity, but made a significant
difference in frictional power dissipation. Ye et al. [8]
numerically examined the load-carrying capacity under
different operating conditions to investigate the effect
of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication caused by the pres-
sure distribution of a textured slipper. They observed that

the maximum stiffness coefficient and optimum oil film
thickness could be determined by operating parameters.
Also, as loading pressure and rotational speed increases,
the collective dimple effect of a textured slipper increase
and creates a thicker oil film thickness. As a result, it
would result in a higher leakage rate.

Although analytical and numerical solutions enhance
our understanding of the physical phenomena occur-
ring between the slipper and swash plate, they are
based on certain assumptions. When the inertial
effects of solids and fluids, thermal factors, and vibra-
tion are considered, mathematical solutions become
more difficult. In such cases, machine learning methods
(MLMs) offer the ability to model non-linear systems
without any assumptions. The use of a neural net-
work (NN) for axial piston pumps was first realized by
Kakaub et al. [9]. In their study, the data obtained from
an experimental setup was used to reduce the power
loss under high pressures. They demonstrated that an
NN trained using Levenberg—Marquardt optimiza-
tion was able to predict the steady-state and dynamic
behavior of the pump accurately. In another study, an
NN was employed to predict the pressure distribu-
tion and load-bearing capacity [10]. The results dem-
onstrated that NNs are more effective than theoretical
models for determining the pressure distribution and
load-bearing capacity. Canbulut et al. [11] reported an
experimental study of the load bearing capacity, leak-
age, friction moment, and pump power properties of
the slipper under different working conditions, and
developed an NN to predict the results. This NN exhib-
ited superior performance at predicting the static and
dynamic parameters of the bearing system. In another
study by Canbulut et al. [12], the effects of the surface
roughness of the slippers on lubrication were studied

experimentally. They also observed that surface rough-
ness has important effects on leakage. In addition, they
designed the behavior of this slipper using an NN, and
argued that their model could be used in real-time
applications. Another study investigated the power
dissipation of conical and flat-surfaced slippers and
observed that the slippers with flat surfaces performed
better. Moreover, the power dissipation was modeled
using an NN, which was found to adapt very well to
experimental data [13]. Canbulut et al. [14] also studied
the frictional power loss of the slipper theoretically and
experimentally. They observed that the study param-
eters and surface geometry contribute to the frictional
power loss, and formed an NN model for frictional
power loss with high predictive capabilities. Ozmen
et al. [15] modeled the pressure distribution and leak-
age of a flat slipper working hydrostatic/hydrodynami-
cally using Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP)
and NN, MLMs. The results showed that both MLMs
had high predictive performance in terms of pressure
distributions and leakage for a flat slipper. However,
analytical equations showed lower performance than
MLMs because of neglected of flow inertia and sys-
tem noise. Following an experimental analysis of the
hydrodynamic and general efficiency variations of gear
pumps, vane pumps, and axial pumps, an NN predic-
tion model was developed to act as a predictor in the
applications of such systems [16].

The objective of this study is to experimentally research
the leakage, oil film thickness, and pocket pressure of
different slipper surface geometries under various work-
ing conditions. Although many NNs have been used to
predict the complex relationship between the slipper
and swash plate, they typically require a high number
of external parameters to be entered, their performance
is directly dependent on the optimization method, and
they are extremely susceptible to noisy data. To over-
come these disadvantages, we investigate the application
of a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep neu-
ral network (DNN), which offers superior performance
in predicting time series. Compared with conventional
MLMs, DNNs can achieve superior classification and
modeling performance [17]. To the best of our knowl-
edge, DNNs have not yet been used for this purpose. The
results derived in this study have been compared with
those from conventional MLMs such as linear regression
(LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM),
and NN. The proposed model is statistically proven to be
superior to all of these methods.

This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, the
working principle, experimental setup, and experimen-
tal method of axial piston pumps are briefly summa-
rized. Next, in Section 3, the DNN prediction model is
Ozmen et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:28

explained. Section 4 presents and discusses the experi-
mental results, and Section 5 gives our conclusions and
ideas for future work.

2 Theorical Background and Experimental Setup
In the axial piston pump shown in Figure 1, when the
cylindrical block turns, the piston moves back and forth
through the swash plate, enabling oil to be pumped under
high pressures. Some of the oil is used to balance the
forces on the piston and to prevent metal-metal contact
between the slipper and swash plate by means of the ball
joint and the orifice. This friction couple directly impacts
the pump performance [18]. Assuming that the bearing
pocket is sufficiently large for the oil film thickness on
slipper land, the pressure distribution for flat slippers can
be theoretically derived from the Reynolds lubrication
equation in cylindrical coordinates:

ry? (1)
In (z+)
when the slipper pocket pressure, geometric dimensions,

dynamic viscosity of oil, and fixed oil thickness are con-
sidered, the theoretical leakage can be derived as [11]:

Q= P,.-2-h?
~ 6-n-In(2) (2)

A multitude of experimental setups has been prepared
to study the different parameters between the slipper and
swash plate, as they have a direct effect on pump per-
formance [18]. In the present study, the experimental
setup in Figure 2a is used to investigate the slipper leak-
age, pocket pressure, and oil film thickness under various
working conditions.

Figure 2b shows the disassembly of the main test unit.
The hydraulic loading cylinder is designed in such a way
as to load three slippers equally. The swash plate, made
of steel, has an axial bearing and its surface has been
sanded. The swash plate is driven by a 5 kW servo motor
with a working range of 0—2300 r/min. The swash plate
has a mean surface roughness of 1.33 um. The slipper in
Figure 3 is made of brass, and its dimensions are listed in
Table 1.

The average oil film thickness and average runout were
measured on one of the slippers using Mitutoyo’s Abso-
lute Digimatic Indicator with Output Comparator, which
has a sensitivity of 1 um (Figure 3). On the other slipper,
the pressures were measured by KellerPA-21-SR 0-6
MPa piezoresistive pressure sensors placed on the meas-
uring holes, with one in the slipper pocket and the others
located 1.5 mm inward from the outer radius at an angle

of 120° and a hole diameter of 0.6 mm. In addition, the
supply pressure was measured with a pressure sensor.
The temperatures of the oil on the slipper and in the tank
were measured with a thermocouple. To measure the
leakage, a flow meter was mounted on the oil inlet sec-
tion, and the same leakage values were recorded with a
measuring cylinder. A fixture was prepared for the slip-
per, and circular dimples were formed on the surface of
the slipper using a face-milling machining production
method. In these experiments, the surface of the same
slipper was milled and used again. Thus, any differences
resulting from manufacturing have been eliminated. Data
from the experimental setup were collected a 20-channel
data logger adjusted to give one datum per second (AHL-
BORN, Figure 2a).

For the experiments, circular dimples (Type 1: 1 mm

results were compared with those from a flat slipper.
The circular dimples were formed close to the slipper
pocket, so that their effect could be better observed
[19]. In the experiments, the temperature of the Shell
Tellus 68 hydraulic fluid was kept constant at 25 °C
(4 =0, 12278 N-s/m*) by means of an air-cooled system.
In addition, each experiment was repeated three times.
The free up and down movement of the slipper when
pressure oil is administered to the system arranges oil
film thickness. Experiments were performed under sup-
ply pressures of 4, 5, and 6 MPa and at turning speeds
of 250, 500, 750, 1000, and 1250 r/min. The mean of
these data (45 data) were used for experimental com-
parisons, and the full 7215 data points recorded by the
data logger were used to form the prediction models,
thus satisfying the high dimensionality required by
DNNs [17]. Note that the second row of circular dim-
ples made in the slippers lifted the slippers excessively,
so that the supply pressure could not exceed 5.5 MPa.
For this reason, the location and dimensions of the cir-
cular dimples in the slipper have been restricted with
the parameters mentioned above.

3 Deep Neural Network Model

Deep learning is very useful in many machine learn-
ing tasks, including speech, image, and signal analysis
as well as numerous classification problems [17, 20-23].
There are a number of DNN architectures, including
convolutional neural networks, stacked autoencoders,
and Boltzmann machines. However, there have been
limited attempts to use DNNs for regression problems.
In this paper, we present a framework for the prediction
of leakage, pocket pressure, and oil film thickness from
the experimental values obtained from the experimental
setup described in Section 2.

The analytical equations for the interaction between
the slippers/swashplate are obtained under the specific
assumptions of the Reynolds lubrication equations in
cylindrical coordinates. However, in reality, solid and
flow inertia, vibration, noise, and friction between parts
all have an effect on the flow. For this reason, we pro-
pose a new technique for the prediction of these param-
eter values using MLMs instead of analytical approaches.
The proposed framework is based on LSTM, which is an
improved version of the recurrent neural network (RNN).

3.1 Recurrent Neural Network

RNNs are DNNs consisting of several basic layers. Both
past and current information are utilized by a RNN [24]
during the training stage, unlike traditional Feed-For-
ward Neural Networks (FFNNs). RNNs have three layers,
namely, input, hidden, and output layers. One of the most
Ozmen et al. Chin. J. Mech. Eng. (2020) 33:28

important issues encountered in the training of RNNs is
the gradient vanishing problem, in which the gradient of
the network becomes close to zero during the back-prop-
agation algorithm.

3.2 LSTM Neural Network

LSTM is an improved RNN that overcomes the gradi-
ent vanishing problem suffered by RNNs [25]. However,
this improvement increases the complexity of the net-
work. Although the structure of LSTM is similar to that
of RNNs, new control parameters including input, out-
put, and forget gates are added to the LSTM network to
control the flow of information between the input time
series. The cell structure of the LSTM is shown in Fig-
ure 4, where x‘? is the D-dimensional input vector, h'7?
is the output of the LSTM cell, and c'? defines the cell
state.

The LSTM cell can take one of two cell states. The first
is the hidden state, also known as the output state. The
second is the cell state denoted by c. In the hidden state,
the output value of the network is obtained from the
input series using the cell state, which controls the infor-
mation flow from past series. There are four important
parts inside the LSTM cell: the input gate (i), forget gate
(f), cell candidate (g), and output gate (0). These gates are
similar to those found in a regular FFNN [25, 26].

1. The input gate, which is used to update the cell state,
is defined as follows:

iM =f (Wax +R) +by), (3)

where i? is the output of the input gate, and W,, R,, b;

are the input weights, recurrent weights, and the bias of

the input gate, respectively.

2. The forget gate determines the level of the cell state
reset, and is given as follows:

f') = f(Wyx'? + Reh) + dy), (4)

where f"") is the output of W >» Ry b, the forget gate, and
are the input weights, recurrent weights, and the bias of
the forget gate, respectively.

3. The cell candidate adds information to the cell state,
and is defined as follows:

g" =f (Wex" + Rh" + be), (5)

where g'"” is the output of the cell candidate, and Wo R,
b, are the input weights, recurrent weights, and bias of
the cell candidate unit, respectively.

4. The output gate controls the amount of cell state
information added to the hidden state:

o! =f, (wox'™ + R,h't-Y + bo); (6)

where 0!) is the output of the output gate, and W,, R,,
b, are the input weights, recurrent weights, and bias of
the output gate, respectively. f, and f, denote the sigmoid
function and hyperbolic tangent function, respectively.

Along with the four equations given above, the follow-
ing two equations are used to generate the output of the
LSTM cell:

oT) = | ETD 44M | gID, (7)

hi?) = 9 © f-(e"’), (8)

where © denotes element-wise multiplication.

3.3. Proposed DNN Framework

DNN has several user-supplied control parameters,
including, batch size, number of iterations, hidden size,
the number of layer, etc. However, there is no theoretical
way to choose these parameters to be tuned heuristically
[23]. As an example, we have observed the performance
of the proposed network with respect to first and sec-
ond hidden sizes. Figure 5 shows that the accuracy of
the pocket pressure according to the different number
of neurons in the first and second hidden layers. So the
proposed framework has five layers: a normalization
layer, two LSTM layers, a fully connected layer, and a
regression layer. The network shown in Figure 6 is called
the deep-LSTM network. The input to the network is

normalized to have zero mean and a standard deviation
of 1 using the normalization layer. Thus, all features are
set on the same scale. For simplicity, the LSTM layers can
be thought of as repetitions of the cell described in the
previous section [26]. The input to the first LSTM layer is
the normalized time series of the input X, whose past and
current information is employed in this layer to generate
the first hidden layer vector h,. To generate the output of
the second LSTM layer, h, is fed into the second LSTM
layer as an input time series.

The second LSTM layer generates M2 for input to the
fully connected layer, which is a regular FFNN whose
output is the predicted output y. The loss between the
predicted value y and the real value y is calculated by the
error function:

T

1 ~
e= 7 So _ yt)? (9)
i=1

where T is the length of the time series and also the num-
ber of samples.

To determine the network weights, the back propaga-
tion algorithm is applied to the whole network. The main
purpose is to decrease the error between the predicted
and real values. The dataset in this study has been divided
into two, with 70% used for training and 30% for testing.
The parameters used for the DNN are summarized in
Table 2.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method,
simulations were repeated 30 times. This was done to
confirm the effectiveness of the deep-LSTM statistically.
As shown in Eqs. (10)—(12), the LR, DT, SVM, NN, and
DNN models use the variable input data obtained from
the data logger as the output data for the leakage, oil film
thickness, and pocket pressure, respectively. The param-
eter values for the SVM, LR, NN, and DT models were
those suggested in the literature. All the simulation pro-
cesses were realized on computers equipped with an Intel

4 Results and Discussion

As the flow rate between the slipper and swash plate is
high, it is considered to be laminar. However, the effect
on the leakage and the oil film thickness is proportional
to the amplitude of the slipper/swash plate runout [4]. As
explained in previous sections, owing to the oil pressure
on the slipper, oil flows from the orifice towards the slip-
per pocket, and this oil results in pressure being applied
in the slipper pocket. As the swash plate turns, the oil
in the slipper flows over the slipper land and prevents
metal—metal contact.

Figure 7 shows the leakage values obtained experimen-
tally under different working conditions for the slipper
with circular dimples. Experimental studies have gen-
erally shown that leakage increases as the supply pres-
sure rises, and decreases slightly as the turning speed
increases [4, 5]. With the 1-mm-deep dimples on the
slipper, all turning speeds and pressures resulted in an
increase in the leakage. This is an undesirable occurrence
in terms of pump efficiency. In the case of the 2-mm-
deep circular dimples, however, the leakage followed a
similar trend to that for flat slippers. As a result of the
experimental study, leakage according to the depth/diam-
eter ratio of the surface texture appeared similar to the
theoretical work [8]. It has been observed that the leakage

increased with surface texture depth. However, the leak-
age decreases after a certain depth of surface texture.

This phenomenon has been explained in the literature
through the vorticity created in slippers with grooves,
and it has been reported that, for a certain groove width
and groove position, the leakage increases in parallel with
increases in the groove depth, but then remains constant
above a certain groove depth [19]. In addition, these
results show that the flow between the slippers/swash-
plate can be controlled by the surface texture.

Figure 8 shows the average oil film thickness. The oil
film thickness is independent of the supply pressure, and
decreases slightly as the turning speed increases. Theo-
retically, under adequate lubrication conditions, while
the slipper is working, the oil film forms through the bal-
ance between the downward forces on the piston and the
upward forces under the slipper. In a slipper with a depth
of 1 mm, where the leakage is as high in Figure 7, the oil
film thicknesses are also high under all working condi-
tions. The increase in oil film thickness, however, will
diminish the friction power loss [27].

Figure 9 shows the pocket pressure of the slipper.
Although the pocket pressure of the slipper does not
change much compared to the turning speed, it does
increase in parallel with the increase in supply pressure.
However, the increase in the oil film thickness between
the slipper and the swash plate acts to lower the pocket
pressure. The lowest pocket pressure for the cases stud-
ied was measured in the slipper with a dimple surface
depth of 1 mm. This is to be expected, as the leakage and
oil film thickness are high in this case.

The experimental studies described above were also
modeled by means of the MLMs described in Section 3.
The models were executed 30 times independently, and

values are presented in Tables 3 and 4. A comparison of
the results and the conformity of the DNN model to 100
test data are presented in Figure 10. Figure 10a shows the
root mean square error (RMSE) in the leakage obtained
from running the models. As seen in the figure and
tables, the DNN model achieved lower RMSE values than
LR, DT, SVM, and NN models. Figure 10a also shows that
the DT and NN models give similar predictions, and that
the LR model yields the highest RMSE and the lowest R?
value in all trials. Although all MLMs generally gave high
mean R? values, the suggested LSTM-based DNN yields

Table 3 Some descriptive statistics for R? values

Page 8 of 11

the best result with the lowest RMSE. Figure 10b shows
the RMSE values for the oil film thickness. As shown
in the figure and tables, the NN and DNN models yield
lower RMSE and higher R? values than the other three
models in all cases, whereas DT gives the highest RMSE
value. However, with its highest R* and lowest RMSE
values, the DNN model is clearly able to generate bet-
ter predictions than the other models. Figure 10c shows
the RMSE values for the pocket pressure. The RMSE
values are close to one another in this case, although the
LR model has the highest error value and the lowest R?
value. This study of the mean values has revealed that,
although the R? values of all the models are quite high,
the DNN model produces the lowest RMSE value for
each of the three slipper parameters, and thus makes the
best predictions.

Although the suggested LSTM-based DNN model
gives better predictions than the LR, DT, SVM, and NN
models, this must be supported by statistical analyses.
Therefore, a non-parametric Mann—Whitney U test was
employed to compare the prediction models at a signifi-
cance level of 0.05. The statistical results are presented
in Table 5, where the mean difference and p-value are
given to show which of the two prediction models is bet-
ter. A p-value of less than 0.05 indicates a statistically sig-
nificant difference. In terms of leakage, oil film thickness,
and pocket pressure, there is a significant difference in
favor of the proposed DNN model (p < 0.05). This shows

5 Conclusions

Preventing metal-metal contact between the slip-
per and swash plate is important in terms of the gen-
eral performance and lifespan of axial piston pumps.
In this article, a slipper with circular dimples has been
investigated in terms of the variation in leakage, oil film
thickness, and pocket pressure under different work-
ing conditions. Dimples with a diameter and depth of
1 mm produced extra lifting force and elevated leakage
and oil film thickness, thus reducing the pocket pres-
sure value. As for circular dimples with a diameter of
1 mm and a depth of 2 mm, they exhibited character-
istics similar to those of flat slippers. Additionally, the
experimental values were modeled using LSTM-based
DNN, and the results were compared with those from
LR, DT, SVM, and NN models. According to the results
and statistical analyses, the proposed DNN approach
yielded the best performance among all the prediction
models studied. These results indicate that DNNs can
be used by designers as a preliminary design tool. Dif-
ferent textures on the slipper provide additional lifting
force at high pressures, and can behave like an oil res-
ervoir under low pressures. In future studies, powerful
machine learning algorithms can be used to examine
the effect of sudden load variations, oil temperature,
and working duration on slippers with different surface
textures and geometries.
