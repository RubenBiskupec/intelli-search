Abstract

Fibonacci numbers are the basis of a new geometric construction that leads to the definition of a family {C, : n € N} of
octagons that come very close to the regular octagon. Such octagons, in some previous articles, have been given the name of
Carboncettus octagons for historical reasons. Going further, in this paper we want to introduce and investigate some algebraic
constructs that arise from the family {C,, : n € N} and therefore from Fibonacci numbers: From each Carboncettus octagon
Cy, it is possible to obtain an infinite (right) word W,, on the binary alphabet {0, 1}, which we will call the nth Carboncettus
word. The main theorem shows that all the Carboncettus words thus defined are Sturmian words except in the case n = 5.
The fifth Carboncettus word Ws is in fact the only word of the family to be purely periodic: It has period 17 and periodic
factor 000 100 10001001001. Finally, we also define a further word W, named the Carboncettus limit word and, as second
main result, we prove that the limit of the sequence of Carboncettus words is W. itself.

1 Introduction
Communicated by Yaroslav D. Sergeyev. In this paper, we associate with each Fibonacci number
Fy, n => 1, a geometric construct C, and then an alge-
braic object W,, obtaining simultaneously three sequences
{Fn},.{Cn},, and {W,,},, where the first one is the well-known
sequence of integers, but the last two are new sequences not
of numbers but of geometrical and algebraic objects, respec-
tively. In particular, {C;,}, 1s a sequence of octagons very

close to a regular one and {W,,},, 1s a sequence of infinite
right words on the binary alphabet {0, 1}. The reasons that
led us to give them the name of Carboncettus octagons and
words come, as we will see, from far away.

Prato is a Tuscan city located 17 km northwest of Flo-
rence. With its 200,000 inhabitants, Prato is the third largest
city in central Italy, after Rome and Florence. The Cathe-
dral of Prato, dedicated to the first Christian martyr Saint
Stephen, is a jewel of Romanesque architecture of interna-
tional appeal: It has ancient roots dating back to at least the
sixth century AD and has undergone numerous renovations
and modifications over the years, including, very important,

those around the eleventh century. The current lateral portal
of the Cathedral (Fig. 1) seems to have been the main portal
at that time, and, in recent years, it has attracted the attention
of various scholars, including several mathematicians, in an
attempt to explain some figures inlaid in marble on the sides
of the portal. It seems that on the right jamb of the portal, the
regularity, symmetry and the subject of the figures recall the
divine perfection and completeness, while on the left jamb,
some almost regular figures seem to symbolize the limits of
human nature, which is made, yes, in the likeness of God, but
which is not divine, nor perfect as the divine one (for a deeper
study into the rich symbolisms behind the representations on
the sides of the portal, the reader can see Pirillo (2017a) and
the references therein).

G. Pirillo was fascinated by this portal and its typically
medieval symbolism from the first time he saw it in the 70s.
Above all, the two inlays with octagonal (or apparently octag-
onal) symmetry placed at the top of each jamb attracted him
very much. The one on the right seems to be based on a perfect
regular octagon, while the one on the left seems to allude to a
different geometric construction of an octagon that uses two
concentric circumferences. Pirillo recently noted that if the
radii of the circumferences are equal to two Fibonacci num-
bers with indices of the same parity and consecutive, then, by
means of a simple construction that uses two pairs of parallel
tangents to the internal circumference, and perpendicular to
each other, one obtains an octagon that is indistinguishable
from a regular one, but which is not itself perfectly regular.!
In few words, this can be viewed as the discovery of a beauti-
ful approximate method to construct a (not perfectly precise)
regular octagon.

It is also very important to note the following fact: The
Liber Abaci by Leonardo Pisano called Fibonacci, where the
{Fi}, series bearing his name appears for the first time, dates
back to 1202 AD, while the portal of the Cathedral of Prato,
for as seen today, dates back to the previous century and
seems to be the work of Carboncettus Marmoriarius, very
active in the twelfth century in those places. If the use of
Fibonacci numbers in the architecture of the portal in Prato
were to be confirmed by other studies, this would be a fact
of enormous importance for two main reasons:

! That is, a couple of Fibonacci numbers of the kind (F,, Fn+2) gives
rise to the Carboncettus octagon C,,, as better explained in Sect. 2 with
more geometric details. All the Carboncettus octagons are very close
to a regular one, with the exception of the first three or at most four
elements of the family {C, : n € N} (see, for instance, Fig. 4 which
displays the already not great difference between a regular octagon and
C2; see, moreover, Eqs. (2), (3), (4) and Table | which collect some
metric data of these initial, “special” elements, and see Pirillo’s papers
(Pirillo 2017a, 2018) for the first observations of such a (suspected)
construction by Carboncettus himself).

F. Caldarola et al.

— This would mean that the Fibonacci numbers were known
at least a few decades before 1202;

— The use of mathematical languages or tools in architec-
ture to express concepts and ideas related to medieval (not
only religious) symbolism seems not to have precedents
before the twelfth century.

In the last two years, Pirillo has discussed many times
the content of Pirillo (2017c) with the other authors of this
work, and this has led to the article Caldarola et al. (2020c)
on “The sequence of Carboncettus octagons.” In this paper
instead, the main novelty is represented by the definition of
an algebraic object for each octagon C;, and, hence, for each
Fibonacci number F,,, it is the right infinite word W,, on the
binary alphabet {0, 1} that will be precisely defined in Sect. 3
as a lower cutting sequence related to the extension of the
height of a triangle which constitutes the octagon C,, and will
be named the nth Carboncettus word. Such an idea to intro-
duce these algebraic objects follows an intuition of the first
author about a peculiarity of the word Ws as expressed in The-
orem |: All the words W, result to be Sturmian words except
just in the single case Ws where we obtain a periodic word
with period 17 and periodic factor 000 100 10001001001.

After the present introduction, this paper is organized into
three central sections: the first two of which take up their titles
from and deal with the mentioned geometric and algebraic
aspects, respectively. In Sect. 2, we will introduce the geo-
metric constructions, arising from Fibonacci numbers, that
lead us to the family of Carboncettus octagons. In Sect. 3
instead, we will define, give some examples of and inves-
tigate the algebraic constructs obtained through the {Cy},
family from the Fibonacci series as well: They are the Car-
boncettus words W,,, and Theorem |, mentioned above, states
our first main result on them. Finally, in Sect. 4 we will intro-
duce the Carboncettus limit word W. and, as second main
result of the paper, we will prove in Theorem 2 that the limit
of the sequence of Carboncettus words is the Carboncettus
limit word.

We inform the reader that we have tried to make this
text self-contained and therefore suitable for reading even by

2 We notice that P. Armienti and A. Albano, in Armienti (2016) and
Albano (2015), respectively, investigated a lunette decoration of the
church of San Nicola in Pisa (Tuscany, IT), and they found the use
of the first Fibonacci numbers until to Fig = 55 and of the golden
section. The dating of the decoration and the building is controversial:
According to some sources, it dates back to 1281 AD, according to other
opinions, to the first decades of the thirteenth century. For completeness
of information, we point out that G. Pirillo has recently proposed an
audacious thesis about the real discovery of Fibonacci numbers: He
argues that some members of the Pythagorean School, very active in
Kroton (today’s city of Crotone, in southern Italy) and in Magna Graecia
in the sixth, fifth and fourth centuries BC, must have necessarily met and
considered the sequence {F,,},, during their mathematical speculations
(see, for example, Pirillo 2017b,c, 2018).

of Theorem 1, in fact, we do use three results that are not
proven here.

As for notations, we use N for the set of positive inte-
gers and No for N U {0}. A sequence is denoted by {an},en,
{dn},, or sometimes simply {a,}. If A, B, C are three points
on the plane, we let AB denote the line segment with end-
points A, B, by |AB| its length and by ABC the measure

2 New geometric constructions from
Fibonacci numbers: the Carboncettus
family of octagons

We recall that Fibonacci numbers are defined by Fo :=
QO, Fy, := 1, and

Fy = Fy—2 + Fr-1 (1)

for alln € N, n > 2; in this way, we obtain the well-known
sequence

O, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,
144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, etc.

Fig.2 The construction of the
first Carboncettus octagon C;

For every real number r > 0, we let J}. denote the circumfer-
ence in the plane R?, centered at the origin and with radius r.
For every n € N, we consider the couple of Fibonacci num-
bers (Fn, Fn42) and the circumferences I’r,, I'r,,,, with
radi Ff, and F,42, respectively. In the following, we will
often refer to I'p, as the internal circumference and to Ir, ,,
as the external one. When n = 1, Ir, = I) and Ip, = I>
appear in green in Fig. 2, instead Fig. 3 depicts the case for
general n > |. We then draw a pair of horizontal tangents to
the internal circumference I‘y, through the two intersection
points with the y-axis and a pair of vertical tangents through
the two intersection points with the x-axis. These four straight
lines, pairwise parallel or orthogonal, intersect the external
circumference I’r,,, at eight points that we denote, starting
from the first quadrant and proceeding counterclockwise, by
Bn, Dn, En, In, Jn, Pn, Qn, An (Fig. 3). The nth Carbon-
cettus octagon, denoted by Cy, (n => 1), is the one obtained
by drawing the polygonal through the points

An, Bn, Dn, En, Th, Jn, Pn, On, An,

and it is represented in red in Fig. 3.

Remark 1 Every Carboncettus octagon C, is obviously a
cyclic polygon, that is, a polygon whose vertices all lie on

the same circumference. But not only, C,, is, more precisely,
an isogonal octagon for all n > 1. An isogonal or vertex-
transitive polygon is a polygon whose symmetry group acts
transitively on the set of all its vertices. Therefore, an isogonal
polygon is equiangular, cyclic and has at most two different
alternating side lengths.

A very interesting property of the Carboncettus sequence
{Cn} nen 1s that all its elements, with the exception of the first
three or at most the first four, are completely indistinguish-
able from a regular octagon. See, for instance, Fig. 4 which
compares the octagon C2 with a regular one inscribed in the
same circumference I'r, = [3: They are yet not too far one
from the other.

Example 1 (The octagon C1) The first Carboncettus octagon
is obtained starting from the circumferences J’r, = J and
Ip, = I> (Fig. 2), and the resulting isogonal octagon Cj has
very particular characteristics. For instance, all the angles
appearing in Fig. 2 are commensurable, because their mea-
sures are integer multiples of

Z£B,ON, = a = 15°.

congruent to A; OB, and four isosceles triangles congruent

inscribed in the same circumference /3. Some metric data
concerning the octagon C> are listed in the second column
of Table 1. Then, the third and the fourth column of the table
do the same for the Carboncettus octagons C3 and C4, respec-
tively.

Much can be said, and there is much to study and inves-
tigate on the Carboncettus family of octagons {C, :n € N},
but we will do it elsewhere because, as anticipated in the
Introduction, we must now move on to the next section to
introduce new algebraic constructs.

3 New algebraic constructs from Fibonacci
numbers: the Carboncettus words W,,

The main reference for the general setting of this section is
Lothaire (2002), but the reader can also see Lothaire (1983)
and Berstel and Perrin (2007) for an essay on the recent origin
of the field called combinatorics on words.

First of all, we need to recall a generalization of (1): A

bers) such that

Gy, i= Gn-2+ Gy_; foralln > 2

is said a generalized Fibonacci sequence, and the couple
(Go, G,) is called the seed of the sequence. For example,
the generalized Fibonacci sequence with seed (2, 1) is called
Lucas sequence and denoted by {Li}nen,- Hence, we have

Lo =2, Li =1,
L5=7, Lo =11,

lo =3, Lg =4,
L7 = 18, etc.

Now, we begin to talk about words, 1.e., finite or infinite
sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet A, starting with
some definitions that we need for our purposes.

For any real numbers 6, po with 6 > O, consider the line

L: y=px+p (5)
in the plane R?, the grid G := {(x,y) € R? :xory €

Z, and x > 0} in the right half plane H := {(x, y) € R?:
x > O}, and the sequence of intersection points of L 1 G

T; = (%1, y1),
etc.,

To = (x0, yo) = (0, p),
Tr = (x2, 2), T3 = (%3, y3),

where 0 = xp < x1 < x2 <...andLOG =({T, :n € No}.

Q) Springer

F. Caldarola et al.

Definition 1 (i) From the sequence {T,},cn,, we define an
infinite word Kg, by writing O for 7p and continuing in
succession for all 7, n => 1, by writing

e Oifx, € Zand y, € Z;
e lify, € Zandx, ¢ Z;
e 10if x, € Zand y, € Z too.

Kg, is called the lower cutting sequence attached to the
line L.

(ii) Similarly, we define an infinite word K/, , called the
upper cutting sequence attached to the line L, by writ-
ing lif yo € Zor Oif yo ¢ Z, and continuing for all
Tn, n = 1, by writing

e Oifx, € Zand y, € Z;
e lify, € Zandx, ¢ Z;
e Olif xy, yn € Z.

For the previous definitions, the reader can also see
(Lothaire 2002, Remark 2.1.12). We now give a very easy
example.

Example 3 Considering the line y = 2x/5, we trivially find
K3/5,0 = 0001001 0001001 0001001 ... (6)

Hence, the lower cutting sequence relative to the line y =
2x /5 is an infinite periodic word with period* 7 and periodic
factor 0001001.

We are now ready to give the central definition of the sec-
tion. Recalling the construction of the Carboncettus octagon
C,, in the previous section, let

y = Bnx (7)

be the line through the origin and the point B,, n > 1 (Fig. 3).
Definition 2 (The Carboncettus word W,,) For every n € N,
we set

Wn := Kg,.0

and we call W,, the nth Carboncettus infinite word or, simply,
the nth Carboncettus word.

Remark 2 Looking at Fig. 3, we can easily note that

The definition of mechanical word or mechanical sequence
is similar to Definition 1. As usual, we let |x | and [x] denote,
respectively, the floor and the ceiling of a real number x.

the lower [upper, resp.] mechanical word with slope a and
intercept o. Moreover, a mechanical word Sq» or Sy, p is said
rational if a € Q and irrational if a ¢ Q.

There are several equivalent definitions of Sturmian word
related to different properties, for which we refer to (Lothaire
2002, Section 2). The simplest way to define it is the follow-
ing.

Definition 4 A Sturmian word is an infinite word w over an
alphabet A which contains exactly n + 1 factors of length n
for alln € No.

For instance, considering factors of length 1, the definition
above implies that every Sturmian word must necessarily
be over two letters of A, i.e., a binary word. The following
theorem establishes which Carboncettus words are Sturmian.

Theorem 1 All Carboncettus words W,, are Sturmian words
except when n = _ 5; in this case, we have an infinite
purely periodic word with period 17 and periodic factor
000 100 10001001001.

Proof rom Theorem 2.1.13 of Lothaire (2002), a lower
mechanical word sy, is a Sturmian word if and only if it
is irrational or, equivalently, if and only if the slope a@ is
irrational. The Carboncettus word W,, is equal to Kg, 9 by
definition, and it is well known and easy to prove that a lower
cutting sequence Kg » is equal to the lower mechanical word
obtained by “dividing the couple (8, o) by 8 + 1,” that is, in
symbols

KB. = SB/(B+1), p/(B+))

(see, for instance, Lothaire 2002, Section 2.1.2). Since
B/(G +1) = 1-—1/(6 + I), then B/(6 + 1) is irrational
if and only if 6 itself is irrational. In conclusion, we have

for alln > O, m => 1: For this purpose, consider m > 1
fixed and assume that (15) is true form =k andn=k +1.
Adding side to side, (15) is hence true forn = k + 2, and
since it trivially holds for n = 0 andn = 1, (15) is proved in
general.

Using (15) with m = n + 2, we then get from (14)

F, F,

VJ Fn Fa+i + Fn+iFn+2 - VJ Fon +42

for all n > 1; hence, Bn 1s rational if and only if F2,+2 is
a perfect square. But Cohn and Wyler proved independently
in 1964 that a Fibonacci number F;,,, m € No, is a square if
and only if m = 0, 1, 2, 12 (see Cohn 1964 and Wyler and
Rollett (1964)); hence,

 

Bn — (16)

Fon42, n> 1, isasquare & n=5. (17)
Therefore, (13), (16) and (17) together prove the first part of
the thesis.

Ifn = 5, we get from (8)

\[F2 - F:

and considering the line y = 5x/12, by some trivial com-
putations, we conclude that W5 = K5/12,0 is a purely
periodic word with period 5 + 12 = 17 and periodic fac-
tor 000 100 10001001001, 1.e.,

In the next example, we compute the first digits of three
more words after the special case W5. We will also need these
explicit determinations in Example 8 of the next section.

Example 6 (The words We, W7 and Wg)

(i) Using (8), we obtain
F6 _ 8/377
[Fe _ F2 377

hence, as in Example 5, we find the first 147 digits of the
Carboncettus word Wg as follows:

Note that for Wg we have written 30 more digits (177)
than for the previous words: The reason for this will be
clear later.

4 The Carboncettus limit word

If A is a finite alphabet, the set of right infinite words over
A is usually denoted by A‘ or A®. It is equipped with a
distance d defined as follows: For any

X = X0xX,...Xp... andy = yoy, ... VE... (22)
belonging to A®, we set

q— min{keNo : xe FAY«} if x Z y:

= 23
a. y) I; ifx=y. CS)

In this way, (A®, d) is a compact metric space (hence com-
plete and totally bounded by a fundamental result in general
topology) called the Cantor space (see Lothaire 2002, Chap.
1). From the distance defined in (23), it follows that a
sequence of words {X,},, C A® converges to Y € A®, and
we write

lim X, = Y (24)
n> CO
in this case, if, for every 7 € No, we have (X,,); = Y; for all
sufficiently large n, 1.e., greater than some v(7). In agreement
with (22), the previous notations

(X))i and Y;

obviously indicate the letter of the words X, and Y, respec-
tively, associated with 7.

Now that we have the notations and definitions necessary
for this section, let us reconsider Fibonacci numbers. Recall-
ing that the sequence of ratios of two consecutive Fibonacci
numbers {Fy)+1/ FrtneNo converges to the golden section

o= (1 + V5) /2,° then

® Since in the Introduction we are committed to making the paper self-

contained (with the exception of Theorem 1), we sketch here what we

think is the most elementary proof of lim Fy,41/F, = ¢. Using only
n> CO

definition (1) and identity (26), it is in fact immediate to prove, through
a trivial induction argument, that

|Fnt1/Fn — | < 1/¢"7'

for alln > 1. For the inductive step note that, ifn — 1 > 1, then

Recalling (8), we then define

and, using (25) and (26), we obtain

~ 0.4133042381.

 

 

 

This leads to consider the line

Y = Boox (29)
and to state the following:

Definition 5 Similar to Definition 2, we set

Woo := Kp.0 = K (30)

(3./5—5)/10, 0

and we call W., the Carboncettus limit word.

Footnote 6 continued
where to obtain the previous inequality we used F,@/F,-1 => ¢ and
the inductive hypothesis.

F. Caldarola et al.

The first digits of W. can be easily computed as in Exam-
ples 4, 5 and 6, getting

Woo = K 3V/5—5)/10, 0
= 000 100 100 010 010 001 001 001 000 100

100 100010 010 001 001 001 000 100 ...

Consider now a family, or better, a sequence of lines {Ly :
n € N} with positive slopes in the plane R*, and assume
that it “converges” to some line L of the form (5). Then, it is
not true in general that the cutting sequence (lower or upper)
attached to L, approaches the cutting sequence attached to
L in the sense of the definition given in (24). And the same
can be said for the slopes of a sequence of mechanical or
balanced words. The following is a very simple example of
what can happen.

Example 7 For any n € N, consider the line

2 41
In: y= 5 n)~

through the origin of the plane. It is clear that the sequence
{Ln}nen converges (punctually) to the line L y=
2x /5 considered in Example 3, but the sequence of words
{K2/5-1/n,0},,cxn does not converge to K/5,9 shown in (6).
In fact, it is simple to check that, for every n > 15, the first
nine digits of K2/5_1/n,9 are 000 100010, hence different
from the ones of K2/5, 0.

We are now ready to prove the main result of the section.

Theorem 2 The limit of the sequence of Carboncettus words
is the Carboncettus limit word, in symbols

n—->C

Proof We want to show that for each fixed i € No it holds
(Wi)i = (Woo)i (32)

for all n € N large enough. Therefore, assume by reductio
ad absurdum that this is not true for all 7, and let 7 be the
smallest 7 such that (32) is not satisfied for infinitely many
n € N. Then, for each positive integer m < j consider the
following unitary open interval

|L Boo: mJ, | Boo -m\|,
New algebraic and geometric constructs arising from Fibonacci numbers

and since 6B, — Boo by definition and Boo ¢ Q (recall (27)
and (28), resp.), then there exists v € N such that

Bn-m € ||Boo-m], [Boo-m)[

for alln > v andm < j. Now, recalling the definition of
lower cutting sequence (see Definition 1(1)), this means that
for every integer 7 from O to at least 7 we have (W,,); =
(Wo); for all n > v, and this contradicts our assumption. O

The previous theorem claims that the sequence of words
whose first elements are (9)—(12), (18) and (19)-(21) con-
verges to (31). Using the definition of distance given in (23),
it is possible to define a further sequence
{On}nen Where 6, := d(Whp, Woo). (33)

Example 8 Numerically, the first elements of {6,},, are the
following:

by = 2°,
9-23

6) =27,

63 = 2-9 64 =
53-2716, 5, — 2-64 (34)

i= 2-40 bg = 27170

as the reader can immediately verify comparing (9)—(12) and
(18)-(21) with (31).

5 Conclusion and future work

After the introductive section, to move faster to present
Carboncettus words, we have reduced to a minimum an
important geometric section like the second one. In a later
work (on “the Prato octagon and regularity measures for
polygons,” see Caldarola 2020), we will devote more space
to the sequence {C,,},,, studying in more depth the charac-
teristics of its elements. For example, already in Caldarola
et al. (2020c) there was mention of the existence of the “limit
normalized octagon” CN, in analogy with W.. Since the
circumferences I", and I"r,,, become larger and larger, CX,
is obtained by normalizing the radius of the internal one.
Another approach to study the limit of {C,},, without car-
rying out normalizations, say Co, is to use non-standard
mathematics or a numerical system that allows calculations
with infinite numbers.’

7 Among many non-standard settings useful for this purpose, the sim-
plest is probably the computational one described in (Sergeyev 2003,
2007, 2017) and also used in (Antoniotti et al. 2020a,b; Caldarola
2018b,a; Caldarola et al. 2020a,e) with limit curves and polytopes,
fractals, or with speculative-didactic intentions. Such computational
system is even applied to Fibonacci words in Margenstern (2015).

17507

We find it fascinating to be able to construct regular or
almost regular geometric figures, by means of simple or
approximate methods, such as the one shown here which
uses Fibonacci numbers to obtain a family of octagons that
are indistinguishable from a regular one. And this must be
understood not only limited to the figures of the Euclidean
plane. The interest, moreover, is undoubtedly greater if it
is possible to trace ancient uses or historical foundations of
approximate methods, very rare until modern times, as far as
we know today.

Much work remains to be done also on the purely
combinatorial-algebraic aspects highlighted here, such as the
sequence of Carboncettus words and its properties, similar or
derived sequences from {C,},,, the characteristics of the ele-
ments in {C,,},,, etc. For example, the sequence {6,,},, defined
in (33) does not decrease monotonously as it is immedi-
ately evident from (34), but it is easy to prove that the two
subsequences of odd- and even-indexed terms, 1.e., {52741},
and {d2,},,, respectively, are monotone (this is because they
depend on the approach of the line (7) to (29) from the above
and below, resp.). Thus, it seems interesting to study and com-
pare their speeds of convergence to zero and other aspects
also in perspective of the so-called unimaginable numbers.

The unimaginable numbers are numbers so large that they
cannot be written through the ordinary scientific or exponen-
tial notation, but they need notational systems specifically
designed for the purpose, such as Knuth up-arrow notation,
Conway chained arrow notation, Steinhaus—Moser notation,
Bowers’s operators and others (see Caldarola et al. 2020b, d
and the references therein for more details). The usual con-
vention is that an unimaginable number is a number greater
than 1 googol = 10! 8

In a sequence of converging words, it often happens that
the distances decrease very quickly and become very soon
“unimaginably small.” For instance, for the fourth element
of the sequence {d2,},,, corresponding to the fourth line of
the form (7) from the above, we already have

6.682 1
—_—___ < ——————-_
10°? /T googol

and, more importantly, note the rapid growth of the expo-
nents in the right column in (34). Unfortunately, however,
despite various evidences, many links between combina-
torics of words and unimaginable numbers remain almost
unexplored nowadays, and we hope that many researchers,

bg = d(We, Woo) = 2719 ©

8 The number | googol is in fact a rather significative threshold for
several reasons, among them because it is of the order of magnitude of
the greatest numbers in the physical realm. For example, the Eddington
number Neda, which represents the number of protons (or electrons)
in the observable universe, should be about 108°, and the total volume
of the observable universe itself should be about 10!7° times that of a
neutron.
