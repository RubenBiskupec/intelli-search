ABSTRACT

Low-frequency oscillations (LFO) are an inevitable problem of power systems
and they have a great effect on the capability of transfer and power system
stability. The power system stabilizers (PSSs) as well as flexible AC
transmission system (FACTS) devices can help to damp LFO. The target of
this study is to tackle the problem of a dual-coordinated design between PSS
and unified power flow controller (UPFC) implementing the task of power
oscillation damping (POD) controller in a single machine infinite bus (SMIB)
system. So, dolphin echolocation optimization (DEO) technique is utilized as
an optimization tool to search for optimal parameter tunings based on objective
function for enhancing the dynamic stability performance for a SMIB. DEO
an algorithm has a few parameters, simple rules, provides the optimum result
and is applicable to a wide range of problems like other meta-heuristic
algorithms. Use DEO gave the best results in damping LFO compared to
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. From the comparison results

between PSO and DEO, it was shown that DEO provides faster settling time,
less overshoot, higher damping oscillations and greatly improves system
stability. Also, the comparison results prove that the multiple stabilizers show
supremacy over independent controllers in mitigationg LFO of a SMIB.

1. INTRODUCTION

Power system must provide power continuity, voltage, and frequency is constant to feed the loads all
the time. To have service reliability, it is required to keep the synchronism of generators synchronization with
sufficient capacity to fulfill the demand load. The problems of stability happen at the synchronization of
the machines which are exposed to turbulence. When there is a change in mechanical torque or decrease
damping torque, will happen LFO in the power grid. If the oscillations are now well damping this might
increase the even-load magnitude and leads to lose synchronism, the operating capability, power system
efficacy and power system stability also will be affected by LFO [1].

Power system stabilizers (PSSs) use for several decades and it was installing with the excitation
system, i.e. automatic voltage regulator (AVR); to reduce affect AVR, damp the local oscillatory mode,
improve power system damping, regulate voltage and enhance power system stability. The oscillations inter-
area occurred by large disturbances and long transmission line may be not needed in control of oscillations by
PSS. Therefore, flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices were utilized for enhancing in addition to
damping oscillations inter-area occurred by large disturbances [2].

FACTS devices are utilized in scheming the active besides reactive power flow in the transmission
line, which have shown very emboldening results. The power transfer limited through modulation of bus

voltage, reactance of transmission line, and damping oscillation promoting. Owing to the action external fast
control related to FACTS operation of the device, therefore enhancement power system stability [3, 4].

The most popular and essential FACTS device is UPFC. It combines the characteristic of two FACTS
devices (i.e. SSSC and STATCOM). It can offer complete compensation, i.e. phase shifting in addition to
voltage regulation, reactive as well as impedance compensation [5, 6]. Also, it is able to optimizing as well as
controlling the power flow, system oscillation reduction, regulation of reactive power, and enhancing
the system transient stability [’7].

In order to enhance overall system performance, must coordination among PSS and UPFC-POD
techniques utilized for damping LFO. Uncoordinated among POD and PSS caused destabilizing interactions
and therefore, unstable be power system. To avoid the issue of interactions, a coordinated design is used to get
the most benefits of multiple stabilizers. This decreases any probable negative interactions among
the various-stabilizers and increases system stability. Numerous of researches have been presented for
the coordination among PSS as well as FACTS-damping controller by utilizing a different method. Parameter
tuning is the key problem in the coordinated among PSS and UPFC-POD simultaneously controller design for
useful damping. The utilization of improvement methods for facilitated configuration must be speedy,
productive. Accordingly, numerous strategies distinctive have been utilized to give the coveted composed plan
and strength to various stabilizers, for example, the utilization of non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization
(NSPSO) [8], fuzzy logic [9] and chaotic optimization algorithm (COA) [10].

In this paper, a new algorithm use of a global optimal search that is based on echolocation, known as
the dolphin echolocation optimization (DEO) technique. The DEO is utilized as an optimization tool to adjust
the damping parameters for independently and dual damping controllers design on the basis of the eigenvalue
objective function. Emulation of SMIB results prepared with UPFC denoted that the dual simultaneous
coordination among PSS& UPFC based-POD had better and faster damping capacity for Lessing LFO with
lesser overshoot compared with the independent design, which improved the stability of SMIB system
pointedly. In addition, DEO has given the better results in individual and coordinated design compared with
PSO algorithm results.

2. MODEL OF SMIB WITH UPFC

Figure 1 shows a SMIB fitted with UPFC device [11]. Transmission line and UPFC are transferring
electric power from the synchronous generator to the infinite bus. The UPFC formed of two voltage source
converters (VSCs), that is VSC 1 and VSC 2 which are coupling through DC link capacitor, excitation
transformer (ET), boosting transformer (BT) and control signals which are consists of four inputs to
the UPFC [12]. These four input control signals are the modulation amplitude ratio (mB, mE) and control angle
phase ratio (6B, dE) for every voltage source converter. DC voltage for two VSCs is providing via a common
capacitor bank to maintain active power balance between two voltage converters. In this work, mE channel is
modulated so as to coordinated design. VSC 1 is insert in parallel with the line via an (ET) and have two input
control (m E and 6 E) which are used to regulate shunt voltage and DC-link capacitor voltage respectively.
VSC 2 is attached to the conveyance line in series via an (BT) and have two input control (mB and 6B) which
are utilized for controlling active in addition to reactive power on the transmission line respectively. These four
input control signals are utilized for providing synchronized power compensation in series line devoid of
external source of voltage [13]. The system parameters are listed in Appendix.

By solving Ch. Equation |AI — A| = 0 utilizing MATLAB, system eigenvalues are obtained and
displayed in Table |. It can be directly understood from Table | that the performance of this system is unstable
due to the existence of two positive damped modes (A3) and (A4) and requires a supplementary controller
for stability.

3. THE POWER FLOW CONTROLLING DAMPING

To damp LFO and ensure system stability, auxiliary control is adopted to the generator stimulation in
the model of flow controller of the unified power—damping controller of power oscillation. The four control
signal coefficients for the unified power flow controller (mE, 6E, mB, and SB) be arrange so as to generate
suitable damping torque as displayed in Figure 2. In this work, used one control signal parameter is excitation
amplitude modulation ratio (i.e. mE) so as to generate the proper damping and for dual-coordination
design [17]. POD controller is like PSS as displayed in Figure 3. Where mad of main blocks of three inputs,

The gain block use for determining the amount of damping the resulting from the PSS. The high pass
filter is shown as the washout block using to remove the DC offset of the PSS or POD output and furthermore
avoids the change of steady-state signal and the phase compensator block is used to supply appropriate
phase-lead characteristic for compensating the phase lag among the generator electrical torque in addition to
the exciter input. The Washout Time (Tw) must have a value in the choice of (1—20 s.). Tw equal to (10 sec),
which are taken in the present study. The POD parameters are Kpss, T,, Tz, T3 and T,, to be calculated. Speed
deviation (Aw) is the POD input signal and AU, is the output of the controller, where Kpss = PSS and/or
mE controllers, i=1,2,3,4 [18].

4. OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

The main target of the technique based on optimization to enhance the power system stability to
disorders at miscellaneous conditions of loading. It be reached by tuning damping of the controller parameters.
The POD is a lead—lag type controller which can be presented as:

U(s) = G(s) Y(s) (18)
where: G(s), Y(s) & U(s) are the transfer function, input signal and output signal of POD controller,
respectively.
In state-space mode, in (18) can be presented as:

X'C =Ac AXc +Bc AU (19)

where: AXC is state vector of the controller. By merging Eq. (17 & 19), the closed loop system can
be achieved.

The objective function is:
J = Min. (Zi) (23)

Here, AXclis the vector state, (i is the coefficient of damping of the i eigenvalue and Ai is

the i eigenvalue of the matrix of closed loop system. It is noticed that objective function J calculates
the minimum value of ¢ibetween wholly system modes (Ai). The target process of optimization is applied for
maximizing J value so as to accomplish a suitable damping for wholly modes containing electromechanical
mode, and maximum J is examined within the restricted choice of POD controller parameters as:

Kp™ < Kp < Kr™, Tri™ < Trix Tri™, Tri™ < Tri < Trim
R = PSS, mE-POD (i.e. UPFC-POD), 1= 1,3, and I= 2,4.
Typical ranges of Kr is (0.01— 100), Tri is (0.001—1) and Trris (0.001-0.1).

5. OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

The main target of optimization algorithm is to determine optimal parameters value of both
independent controllers (PSS only) or (UPFC-POD only) and simultaneous coordinated designs among
(PSS and UPFC-POD) to enhance system oscillations damping and dynamic stability performance for
a SMIB. In this study, DEO and PSO algorithms are utilized for solving the described problem.

5.1. (PSO) algorithm

It is first introduced and developed by Eberhart and Kennedy in year 1995 [19]. The behavior of
swarms of birds, each nominee solution to the optimization problem was represented randomly as a “particle”
in the identity D-dimension space, and each group of particles contains a “population” [20, 21]. The position
arranged for each particle in a hyperspace is stocked in a memory named “pbest”, which is in link to fitted
solution in each experience. Furthermore, the location arranged to the best value up to now amongst entirely
the populated particles in the memory that is denoted as “gbest”. The “pbest” and “gbest” changed for every
iteration of the PSO algorithm, and every velocity of the particle is changed towards them randomly.
The velocity and position of each agent are [22]:

vi *! = w.vi* +c 1.11. (pbesti - sik ) + coro (gbesti -
sik) (24)

S; k+l] — S;* + Vi k+1 (25)

where, S is the position of agent, v is the velocity, k is the iterations number, w depicts the weight, c:, cz are
the cognitive and asocial positive constants that utilize to pull every individual on the way to Dyes; position and
Qoest POSition within range [0 to 2.05] and 1, r2 are the two random numbers within limit [0 to 1].

5.2. (DEO) algorithm

Kaveh and Farhoudi have been developed and enhanced a new technique of optimization called
the Dolphin echolocation optimization (DEO) method in year 2013 [23]. Dolphins can discover their
environment by using the benefits of echolocation. The basic idea of DEO algorithm come from mimicking
the behavior of Dolphins when hunting. The Dolphin can gift sound in the type of a tap in different locations
and as soon as this sound hits something, many of the sound power is return back towards the Dolphin such as
echoes. So, the Dolphin is listening to them and now wants to make a choice. Dolphin recognizes
a distance to the baits and where they are. Tracing stage is begun and Dolphin move to bait, continue sending
sound in addition to receiving echoes until Dolphin access the preys. During this approach, the probability of
the hunting increases every time and search space reduced continuously. When dolphin received echoes from
different locations, at this time the Dolphin can process and evaluate this information and decide to select
the next step, which is a very essential step [24]. Figure 4 shows the process of DEO algorithm.

5.2.1. Mathematical formulation of the DEO algorithm

The typical flowchart of DEO technique is presented in Figure 5 and the steps of the tuning process
are [25]:
Step 1: Initialization

Choose the maximum number of loops N, number of locations NL randomly and number of variables
NV which are (Kp, Tp; and Tp,) in the proposed controller (i.e. PSS or UPFC-POD). This step enclose creating
LNL+NV matrix. Maximum alternative number MA in the search space to creating alternative matrix with
dimension [MAxNV].
Step 2: CF finding and predefining

Compute the PP of the loop utilizing following equation:

PP(Loop;) = PP, + (1
Loopi ?°”®" —1
PP) p (26)

(Loops Number)Power — 1

where, PP is the probability, PP; = 0.1 is the first loop Convergence Factor (CF) where the results are randomly
chosen, Loop i number of the loop in which optimization process is performing as well as power is degree of
the curve. Power < | which generally offers best results.
Step 3: Fitness calculation

In this work, the suggested objective function for the controller has been calculated as following:

J = Min. (¢): Objective function
Max. (J): Fitness function

Step 4: Fitness accumulated (FA) Calculation
Compute FA and find L Gj) in jth column position of the matric of alternatives denoted as
A. X = —Re to Re

AF (A+X)j = (1/Re)*(Re - Xl) Fitness(i) + AF (a+xij)j (27)

From the above equation: AF (4+x) ;: is the Accumulative Fitness of the (A+X). Re depicts the affected radius
where AF of the alternative A’s neighbours is influenced for their fitness then calculates the AF for every j"
variable in L Gj) location by utilizing the Dolphin equation given in eq. 30. This radius was chosen as being
less that 1/4 of the search space size. It is worth that the close age alternatives (A + X <0 or A+ X > LAj,
where A + X is not a valid), the calculation of AF is performed by using a reflective characteristic. In order to
hand out the search space alternative, a small amount of € is applied to the wholly groups as AF = AF + €.
Now, € is better to be less than any possible fitness.
Step 5: Finding best location

Find the best location, where will have finest AF and let AF for finest location alternative equal zero.
Step 6: Determination of probability as well as allocation

Calculate the probability P (1,j) as following:

AFij
LAj es

P (ij) = (28)

Let probability equal to:
P (i,j) = PP for wholly variables of the finest position.
P (1,j) = (1-PPioopi).-P(G,j) else.
Step 7: Select location of the next loop
Modify the locations of the next loop according to allocated probability of its alternative.
Step 8: Reiteration
The ultimate criterion of termination is achieved or once the value of J is maximum, if yes stop
the optimization and print the best results; otherwise, repeat steps 2 to 7. The user-provided parameters for the
DEO and PSO algorithms are tabulated in Table 2.

6. SIMULATIONS RESULTS

In this section, the capabilities of the presented dual and multiple coordinated designs are evaluated
to improve the system's dynamic stability by damping the LFO. Figure 6 shows the speed deviation response
without any controller is not stable without any controller and there is increasing of the oscillations. So as to
obtain the optimal response of the PSS & POD controller, use the DEO algorithm and it is compared with PSO.
The final values of optimized parameters and damping ratio (C) are gives in Table 3.

Figure 7 displays SMIB's response to speed deviation with the traditional individual controller
(i.e. PSS only). It can be seen that PSS controller has effective damping the system oscillations by using DEO
algorithm compared to the PSO. Where the speed deviation responses via using DEO algorithm show that

Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 10, No. 6, December 2020: 6111 - 6121
Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708 O 6119

the parameters improved and they are higher than settling time in comparison to their PSO. Figure 8 displays
SMIB's response to speed deviation with the proposed individual UPFC-POD controller, we selected excitation
amplitude modulation ratio (i.e. channel mE only) to test the damping of oscillation. It can be seen that
the channel is acceptable for damping oscillations.

Figure 9 illustrates the speed deviation responses of SMIB with the proposed coordinated design
between PSS & UPFC-POD (channel mEonly) simultaneously. It can be noticed that better dynamic response
is achieved by the coordinated design between PSS & UPFC-POD. Using DEO is most superior, which has
fewer oscillations in addition to much quicker than PSO technique. Settling time is (2 sec.) as well as overshoot
is (0.00667 p.u) by DEO but PSO the settling time is (6.62 sec.) and overshoot is (0.009757 p.u). So, it can be
noticed that the settling time and over shoot obtained by DEO 1s less than that obtained by PSO as demonstrated
in Table 4.

7. CONCLUSION

The present study focuses on low frequency damping oscillations by individual and furthermore
through dual design of coordination between PSS and UPFC-POD in SMIB system. The optimal tuning
parameter problem of individual controller design or multiple damping controllers in the coordinating design
is converted into an optimization problem. DEO algorithm employed as a new optimization technique for
robust and optimized calculations to search and tune for optimal parameters settings of controllers in both
independent controllers (PSS only) or (UPFC-POD only) and simultaneous dual-coordinated designs between
(PSS and UPFC-POD) based on the given objective function via maximizing J of the minimum damping ratio
so as to accomplish the suitable damping for all complex eigenvalues (Ai) for a SMIB. The simulation results
confirmed that the DEO provide optimal or very close to the optimal results and robust effective in damping
of LFO of individual and coordinated designs compared with PSO technique. In addition, using DEO achieved
shortest settling time, minimum overshoot, provide higher LFO damping as well as advance the stability of
the system best than PSO algorithm. Furthermore, a synchronized design of multiple damping stabilizers 1.e.
PSS & UPFC-POD controller offer a better damping of LFO compared to individual controllers i.e. PSS or
UPFC-POD only. Thus, the controllers with DEO are achieved best dynamic stability response in both
individual and multiple controllers in addition to the best damping of LFO compared to PSO technique.
