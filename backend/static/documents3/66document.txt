Abstract: Precise control of the flow rate of fluids stored in multiple tank systems is an important
task in process industries. On this reason coupled tanks are considered popular paradigms in studies
because they form strongly nonlinear systems that challenges the controller designers to develop various
approaches. In this paper the application of a novel, Fixed Point Iteration (FPI)-based technique is reported
to control the fluid level in a “lower tank” that is fed by the egress of an “upper” one. The control signal is
the ingress rate at the upper tank. Numerical simulation results obtained by the use of simple sequential
Julia code with Euler integration are presented to illustrate the efficiency of this approach.

Keywords: robust fixed point transformation; fixed point iteration; dual fluid tanks; control; fpi-based
simulations; level control of liquids

1. Introduction

Tackling nonlinear problems in Control Engineering (CE) is an emerging field of the modern
era, it affects our life at several aspects [1]. Control of level of liquids, in coupled tank systems,
has prime importance in process industries. Many industries and production units can be enlisted
where the importance of the level of the fluid stored in several tanks play significant role, for instance,
in food processing units, dairy filtration, plants of nuclear power generations, companies dealing with
pharmaceutical products, in system of water purification units, spray coating industries, etc. Furthermore,
controlling the level of liquids in industries is also remarkably useful to enhance the economic beneficial
and quality of the products prospects (e.g., [2]). In the practice this field is very rich and several design
techniques have been developed in nonlinear control. In [3] Li et al. elaborated a case study on the
application methods and explained several points about process control by taking linear and nonlinear
tanks as examples, which were further explained in detail by simulations. The chain of coupled tanks
form a typical nonlinear system because the egress rate of a tank is nonlinear function of the fluid pressure,
i.e., the height of the liquid in the tank. However, if only positive input rate is available as control action,
the problem is further burdened by truncation-type nonlinearities. According to [4] mathematical tank
models can be obtained by analytical and experimental methods while for the Coupled Fluid Tanks (CFT)
system those models can be obtained by applying the laws of energy and mass conservation, and the model
describing the behavior of the liquid flow in the exit tap that contains nonlinear terms for turbulent flow.

It is important to know that first time the automatic liquid level control system for a laundry appliance
was patented in 1981 [5], and in 1992 the earliest study was reported on controlling the liquid by using
capacitive sensors [6]. This invention consisted in a liquid level control system for selectively activating
and deactivating a pump according to the liquid level indicated by the capacitive sensors. In [7] the
authors elaborated a significant and feasible nonlinear feedback control. To explain this concept it was
further demonstrated by a case study of the control performance of water tank level. In several studies
on controlling the dual or longer chains of tanks Sliding Mode Control (SMC) was employed by several
researchers (e.g., [8—11]). In [8] authors have successfully reduced the chattering problem associated
with SMC by proposing two different dynamic schemes. They have presented the results by successful
simulation performed in MATLAB. An experimental set-up was illustrated that guaranteed asymptotic
stability of the closed loop system. The design and analysis of sliding mode controller by simulation and
experimental results were presented in [12] to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers
proving its capability of dealing with intrinsic uncertainties of the model and its superior performance
than the traditional PI control.

Struggles from various aspects using several methods and tuning techniques can be studied in the
literature (e.g., by [13,14]). In [15] authors studied the dual fluid tanks level control by comparing the
efficiency of the parameter estimation method with the performance of numerical derivation technique.
The method was based on the estimation of the ultra-local model parameters instead of using numerical
derivation technique. An adaptive PI method was applied in order to overcome the influences of the
perturbations and noise output signals. To optimize the PID parameters of dual fluid tanks system
controller,a design methodology using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), was proposed and it was
claimed that this method provides efficient results in comparison to the genetic algorithm-based method in
a shorter and better time resolution [1]. To implement an improved neural network-based approximation
Dynamic Programming named Action-Depended Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming (ADDHP) was
viably used by omitting the model network completely in [16]. The proposed method successfully provided
the results where only the use of the states of the present and previous time steps were considered to
calculate the derivatives of the performance function by avoiding the prediction of the states of the next
time step.

Maintaining the fluid range in a pre-defined, desired level is a practical paradigm used in several
control teaching laboratory experiments [17]. For this purpose the mathematical model of the plant can be
used in the control design. Further study of the Comparison of the Operation of Fixed Point Iteration-based
Adaptive and Robust VS/SM-type solutions for controlling “Two Coupled Fluid Tanks” (TCFT) have been
recently done in [18], (that was accepted for publication), where it was comparatively proved that rather
VS/SM type solutions FPI-based solutions are more efficient and applicable.

The fluid level can be controlled by determining the input flow rate in tanks that in the same time
produce some outputs. The specified level of liquid in one of the tanks is called the set point and it
expresses the process variable. The error can be defined by the difference value of the actual liquid level
and the set point. By measuring the process variable the controller decides to set the appropriate position.
In this study the level control of fluid in the pre-selected range of the below tank shown in Figure 1 was
studied using the novel Fixed Point Iteration (FPI)-based method from a new and particular prospect.
The method is successfully applied, and viable results are produced using several adaptive parameters in
Julia language by writing a simple programming code.

In the sequel the paper is organized as follows; Section 2 explains the method used in this study and
the software which is used to write the code for simulation results. In Section 3 the details of the FPI-based
method is discussed briefly. Section 4 describes the case study of the Dual Tank systems and the equation
of motions of the system in detail. Control task of the system and the details related to the procedure is

discussed in Section 5. Using simulation the required produced results are discussed with parameters and
their values in Section 6. The conclusion of the study is given in Section 7.

2. Methodology

In plant and industrial process system, based on strongly complex nonlinear systems, basic knowledge
of mathematical analysis and information about the nature of the controlled system is required. In such
complex nonlinear systems, manual study for the derivation of the precise analytical model, is almost
impossible. The controller can be designed by the use of some available approximate model (it may have
either “analytical form” or “soft computing-based formulation”), and the effects of modeling imprecision
can be compensated either by robust or adaptive techniques. The operation of the various approaches
normally can be compared by the use of numerical simulations. To conduct this research authors used
JULIA language where a simple sequential code was developed to perform the task of level control
of the fluid in CFT systems. he JULIA language is one of the fastest high-level and high-performance
computer programming tools for dynamical systems, and it can be used for obtaining numerical solutions
in computational sciences, which works e.g., on the ATOM based environment using libraries /repositories
of other programming languages e.g., MatPlotLib of Python, Fortran etc., The well-known Fixed Point
Iteration (FPI) method was used to study the fluid level in the lower tank of vertically fixed dual tanks.

3. On the Concept of Using of Fixed Point Iteration-Based Control Method

Based on certain antecedents, it was Stefan Banach who introduced the concept of linear, normed,
complete metric spaces, that after him, later, were named “Banach Spaces”. He systematically used
this concept in proving various theorems via constructing contractive functions that map a Banach
space into itself. In his “Fixed Point Theorem” [19] in 1922 proved that by the use of such functions
iterative Cauchy sequences can be generated that converge to the unique fixed point of these functions.
His invention successfully extended the set of classic mathematical methods as e.g., the Newton-Raphson
algorithm that is regarded to be one of the most efficient ones even in our days [20].
Computation 2020, 5, 96 4 of 13

As an alternative of the Lyapunov function-based adaptive control technique that was based on
Lyapunov’s PhD dissertation [21], and became known by the Western World in the sixties of the past
century [22], Banach’s method was introduced in the adaptive dynamic control in [23]. In this approach,
Banach’s iterative technique was used so that finding the appropriate control signal was transformed to
finding the fixed point of a contractive map in an iterative manner for which, during one digital control
cycle, only one step of this iteration could be done. At the beginning the available approximate dynamic
model is used, and its input is step by step so deformed that finally the response of the controlled system
corresponds to the “desired”, purely kinetically calculated one. In this early approach the “Robust Fixed
Point Transformation (RFPT)” was used for transforming the control task into a fixed point problem.
Later on to confirm its applicability several papers were produced using this FPI method from various
applicable aspects (e.g., [24-27] etc.) and other functions were introduced too, for this task (e.g., [28-30]).
A brief discussion about its applicability and working procedure is given below.

Consider the equation of motion of the controlled system in the differential form h = f(h,u),
where hh € R™ is for the state variable of the system, U € RX is called a control signal. The initial condition
of the motion can be expressed as hg = h(t)) which is given in advance. Using the inverse of the
equation given in Equation (2) the necessary calculated force can be expressed in mathematical form
as uPs!(t) = fappr (h(t), hP*(t)) that is clearly described in Equation (5). The realized state-drift can

be expressed as h(t) = fexact (h(t), u®'(t)), where the estimated control variable is involved. In this
manner the function i can be defined as a “response function” that depends on the exact and the inverse
approximate models: h = yw (h(t),h?(t)). Because the available approximate model is not precise,
h cannot be equal to the desired one as p (h(t), h?%(t)) 4 h?*(t). In this kind of adaptive control the
basic idea is to find a suitably deformed input argument e.g., r, for that can be equal to the desired
one as  (h(t),r.(t)) = h?*(t). Hence, this deformed value can be a limit of an iterative sequence
{ro = hP&(t),...,Th1 = G (re, p (x(t), rp) , 4? (t)) ,...}, where G is another function that expresses the
Robust Fixed Point Transformation:

G (r, p (h(t), 1) /hP®(t)) ! r+ K) E 4+ Btanh (A(y (n(t),r) — hP*(t))) _K, (1)

where A, B and K are used as the adaptive control parameters. In many cases we have obtained efficient
and acceptable results by the use of suitably determined adaptive control parameters (e.g., [31,32]). Here,
if |K| >> |r| and a very small value of A are chosen, the iteration converges to the desired point r, if the
sign of the first derivative of y with respect to r ie., oe does not fluctuate. It is evident by inserting r,
into Equation (1) that G (rx, p (A(t), r4) ,hP*(t)) = r., that means that r, is the fixed point of function G.
The contractivity must be guaranteed for the convergence of the function by suitably fixing the values of
the adaptive parameters.

4. Study of Dual Tank Systems

The two-tank-system under consideration is described in Figure 1 where the liquid tanks are fixed on
upper and lower position and the liquid spills from upper i.e., tank 1 to the lower i.e., tank 2. The liquid
level is predefined for tank 2 as function of the time. The two identical liquid tanks have the same
section expressed by S m2. The water level in the upper tank is denoted by h,(t), which is the first state
variable. Similarly, the water level in the lower tank 2 is expressed by h(t) (i.e., the second state variable).
Suppose that a pump can be adjusted that pumps the liquid into the first (upper) tank by a connected pipe.

Variable gq; (t) m> -s~' expresses the input flow of the upper tank after pumping by the pump, q2(t) m°-s~!
is the output flow of the upper tank and q3(t) m° -s~! denotes the output flow of the lower tank. In the

steady state, the conservation of the total volume of water leads to q,(t) = q3(t).

Model Representation
The exact nonlinear models of the considered system are as follows:
— yy ui, ky hy — koh 5

in which ky, ko [m® [2. s] ,and S [m7] are parameters of the outlet assuming turbulent egress.

5. Control Task of the Dual Tank System

Our task is to control 2 by using the control signal u. It can be observed in (2) that the first derivative of
the controlled variable hy i.e., hy does not depend directly on the control signal. To establish a relationship
between them, the 2nd time-derivative of hz is used which directly depends on the 1st time-derivative hy
of hy. According to (2) this directly depends on the control signal. By this relation it can be seen that the
relative order of the control task is 2. By using the chain rule of differentiation it is obtained that

. ky 12; ko, -1/2;
lig = Sen Why — 2h Mh (3)

From (2) h; can be substituted into (3) that results in

kyhy 1! ky ko) 4/2;
792 UW sex — 56/2 hp . (4)

 

hy =

Therefore for a “desired 2nd time-derivative of hy”, h?°, the model using the available approximate
parameters is:
1/2 1/27
_ 28*hy 29 TL bes Lk; ph! 4. kySh, hy (5)
ky kh?

Equation (5) must be completed with the restriction that the feasible control signal is u > 0. If this
equation requires negative control signal, it is truncated at zero.

By the comparison of adaptive FPI-based and Robust VS/SM-type control solutions by [18] it
was concluded that adaptive FPI-based solutions are more feasible and efficient. For the system’s
desired second time-derivative in principle a great variety of functions can be so invented in the form
ges = f (GN, g,q,4,q,t) that ||qN(t) — q(t)|| > 0 as t > oo. In the simple PD type controller for the

control of n € N order systems where the nth

order time-derivative of g can be instantaneously adjusted by
the control action. To specify and establish the “desired trajectory tracking error relaxation” the trajectory
tracking error can be introduced as the difference of the “Nominal Trajectory” to be tracked (q\ (t)), and the

realized one (q(t)) as
def
e(t) = q(t) — q(t) (6)
with a constant parameter A > 0a purely kinetically defined PD-type tracking policy can be chosen that aims
at the realization of the error relaxation according to

ges = aN + A2e+2Ae . (7)

In the paper [18] it was found that too big A may cause instabilities at the beginning when the initial
error is large, however, later, for more precise and fast tracking a greater A value would be expedient.
If this value is not exactly constant but it slowly varies in comparison with the “dynamics” of the signal to
Computation 2020, 8, 96 6 of 13

be tracked, its slow variation does not mean significant problem in the error relaxation. For this purpose,
in this paper its value was set according to the rule

Cmax Amax€max .
Ai,=A —— ° Ny = — —; A =min(A,A2) , 8
1 max \| 5 el 2= 5 et G (Ay, Ag) (8)

in this manner great tracking and tracking velocity errors set relatively small feedback, while for small
errors the maximal value Ajax is well approached.

For the adaptive deformation of the input of the available approximate system model the classic RFPT
function given in Equation (1) was used. It has to be noted that at the beginning some initial information
is needed on the operation of the non-adaptive controller. Abrupt switching on the adaptivity may cause
a local shock that can be avoided by introducing the adaptive deformation with a continuously increasing
weight function of time in the following manner:

w(t) =Ofort < tag , (9)
w(t) = tanh (") fort > tag , (10)
GPE (tn) = wltn)G (GP (tn1), GP (tn), G(tn—1)) + (1 — (tn) AP (tn) (11)

in which the adaptive deformation is switched on at time t,3, the parameter T s determines the typical
time for reaching the full deformation, t, belongs to the commencement of the nth discrete control cycle.
(When the control signal is truncated at u = 0 the adaptivity is switched off, and later, when its reactivation
becomes possible, it is turned on again, gradually.)

6. Simulation Results for the Coupled Tank

In the simulations the nominal trajectory to be tracked was a “chirp signal” that corresponds to
a “sinusoidal” function with slowly increasing frequency. The model and control parameters are given
in Table 1, the time-resolution of the Euler integration was At = 10~* s. In the first simulations in
Equations (9)—(11) the T < At value corresponded to “abrupt switching on” of the adaptivity when the
control signal u left the negative, truncated region.

For setting the value of Ajay numerical simulations were done. It was found that for Ajay > 6 s! the
results were distorted, that means a kind of speed limitation of the control. Gradual increase of the positive
value of Ajay from 1 improved the trajectory and the desired trajectory went closer to the nominal value.
Typical results are given in Figure 2 in which typical “overshooting” are observable for large values.

It is worthy of investigation how the gradual switching on the adaptivity concerns the control. In the

and the appearance of a smooth signal in spite of the drastic modeling errors in the system’s parameters.

7. Concluding Remarks

In this paper the operation of an improved, fixed point iteration-based adaptive controller’s operation
is investigated via numerical simulations. This approach is a mathematically quite simple alternative of the
traditional, Lyapunov function-based adaptive control design in which the kinematic and dynamic aspects
of the desired control operation are sharply separated from each other. The tracking requirements
(normally the relaxation of the trajectory tracking error) is formulated at first, then, by the use of the
Computation 2020, 5, 96 11 of 13

available approximate system model, the input of this model is deformed in an adaptive manner until
the realization of the kinematic requirements is achieved. The method is based on Stefan Banach’s fixed
point theorem from 1922, which is so utilized in a digital control, that during one control step, one step of
the adaptive iteration can be executed.. The improvement of this approach consisted in using tracking
error-dependent kinematic error feedback parameters and gradually switching on the adaptation rule,
so avoiding an “initial shock”.

For testing the method the popular paradigm of two coupled liquid tanks was considered in which the
ingress fluid rate of the first tank was used for controlling the fluid level in the second tank. Besides being
a strongly nonlinear, relative order 2 control task, the problem was made more complicated by the physical
impossibility of applying “negative control signal”. Whenever fulfilling the kinematic requirement required
negative control action, the control signal was truncated at zero, and the adaptivity was switched off
until the appearance realizable positive control signals that made it possible to observe the effects of the
adaptive deformation again. This simple physical system can serve as a paradigm for chemical systems’
control and control issues in life sciences (e.g., treating the illness type 1 diabetes mellitus) in which the
control input corresponds to the ingress of some pure reagent as e.g., insulin, but a pure reagent cannot
be extracted from the system, i.e., no negative control signal can be applied. In further research the noise
sensitivity of the method seems to be worthy for investigation.
