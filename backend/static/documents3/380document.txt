1 Introduction

The 3GPP standards support the interworking between the advanced long-term evo-
lution (LTE-A) networks and other wireless networks to provide better services in
coverage, cost, and performance. These heterogeneous wireless networks will serve
a huge number of users and applications that demand higher data rates, lower
latency, and energy consumption. For the sake of providing seamless and fast han-
dovers in the heterogeneous networks, the delay and cost caused by authentica-
tion protocols should be reduced. In addition, the authentication protocols should

be secured against authentication attacks. Therefore, the authentication process has

increasingly become more important, especially in the new 5G heterogeneous
networks.

The basics of current 4G Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocols will
be utilized in the new 5G networks; thus, the 4G authentication protocols should be
improved to meet the demand of this new technology. For instance, the users in the
LTE-WLAN-WiMAX interworking architecture must be authenticated by the LTE Home
Subscriber Server (HSS) in the home network, which adds delay and overhead on these
servers each time the user connects or moves in the interworking architecture. It also
makes this server a subject of single point of failure. From the performance aspect, the
delay caused by the authentication process adds overhead to the seamless and fast han-
dover process. The effect of delay could be more severe in the case of 5G application
that are delay-sensitive applications. From the security point of view, the user identity
disclosure attack can be launched in the first connection, when the International Mobile
Subscriber Identities (IMSIs) are sent by users to HSS without protection in a clear text.

In WLAN, LTE, and WiMAX networks, the fast re-authentication protocols have been
proposed by standards to reduce the authentication delay and cost of full authentica-
tion protocols such as Improved Extensible Authentication Protocol-AKA’ (EAP-AKA’),
Evolved Packet System-AKA (EPS-AKA), and Initial Network Entry Authentication
(INEA), respectively [1] and [2]. Despite of fast re-authentication protocol’s efficiency in
reducing the authentication delay and cost, they still suffer from User Identity Disclosure
(UID) attack, Lack of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)
attack. In addition, the fast re-authentication protocols are invoked regardless of the han-
dover type (i.e., inter and intra), which inherit high delay; therefore, it is considered as
insufficient solution for 5G networks.

In this paper, the standard AKA protocols that are used in LTE, WLAN, and WiMAX
networks have been reinvented to present new re-authentication protocols for each net-
work domain. The new re-authentication protocols enhance the security aspects and the
performance in terms of delay, cost, and energy consumption. The proposed protocols
are aimed to provide fast and secure different handover types, and these features allow
the proposed protocols to effectively work in the 5G heterogeneous wireless networks.

In the case of applying the proposed protocols in the 5G networks, the names of the
entities that are involved in the authentication process will be changed, for example, the
functions of eNB will be handled by next-generation Evolved Node-B (ng-eNB), the func-
tions of authentication server (AS) will be handled by Authentication Server Function
(AUSF), and the function of storing long-term keys in HSS will be handled by the Unified
Data Management (UDM).

The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

e A new method is proposed to prevent UID attack and reduce the handover delay,
cost, and the overhead on AS, which contributes significantly in reducing delay and
cost during different handover types in heterogeneous networks.

e Three standard full authentication protocols, EAP-AKA’, INEA, and EPS-AKA
protocols, are enhanced to provide full authentication process between the user and
WLAN, WiMAX, and LTE networks, respectively, when the user connects to one of
these networks for the first time.

e A set of new re-authentication protocols is proposed to be performed after the
enhanced standard authentication protocols. These protocols provide fast inter and
intra re-authentication processes in LTE-WiMAX-WLAN interworking architecture
during inter and intra handovers, respectively. In addition, in the case of any failure
occurs in the HSS server, the local servers have the ability to complete the
authentication process, which results in avoiding the single point of failure.

e A new unified key hierarchy is proposed to be suitable for the module of the

networks involved in this work.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 3 presents an overview of
the interworking architecture between LTE-WLAN-WiMAX networks; it also presents
the standard full and fast authentication protocols. A brief of the related works is
also presented in this section. Section 4 describes the proposed authentication and re-
authentication protocols. Section 5 provides a security analysis of the proposed protocols
while Section 6 evaluates the performance of the proposed protocols compared to the
standard and other protocols. Section 7 concludes the paper.

2 Methods

In this paper, the proposed protocols and methods are presented in Section 4, where
the standard AKA protocols that are used in LTE, WLAN, and WiMAX networks are
enhanced to present new re-authentication protocols for each network domain. These
enhancements make the proposed protocols applicable for 5G networks. To prevent
the UID attack, a Kerberos-based method is proposed. A new unified key hierarchy
is used to be applied in each network type in the interworking architecture. The new
re-authentication protocols are locally performed during inter and intra handovers to
provide secure and fast handovers. In Section 5, the security aspects of the proposed pro-
tocols are analyzed and verified using well-known verification tools. Section 6 presents
the evaluation results and discussion of the proposed protocols, where a scenario of user
movements and an analytical model is proposed for evaluation and comparisons of the
proposed protocols with standard and other methods in terms of delay, cost, storage, and

energy consumption.

3 Overview and related works

3.1 Heterogeneous wireless networks

Heterogeneity is one of the most features of the current 4G and the next 5G networks.
This section presents an overview of the heterogeneous wireless networks such as LTE,
WLAN, and WiMAX networks.

The security was not completely specified in the earlier versions of WLAN. It was spec-
ified in the IEEE 802.11i amendment. The key management and authentication are also
included in this standard. The Remote Authentication Dial in User Service (RADIUS)
protocol supports EAP-AKA authentication protocol [3].

The security of WiMAX has been specified by the IEEE 802.16 standard as a security
sub-layer in the Medium Access Control layer. The INEA authentication protocol is a part
of the Privacy Key Management (PKM). The PKM is a security protocol that has been
adopted in the WiMAX security sub-layer to provide authorization, authentication, key
exchange, and key distribution between base stations (BSs) and mobile stations (MSs) [41].
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 4 of 34

The last standard of WiMAX is the WiMAX-Advanced which has many features such as
supporting mobile internet and MIMO [5].

The long-term evolution of the Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) is one
of the Third-Generation Partnership Projects (3GPPs) which was defined by 3GPP in
November 2004. The recent projects are LTE and its enhanced version, which is the LTE-
Advanced (LTE-A).

In LTE-A, a wider bandwidth is provided, and antenna technology is improved and used
in both uplink and downlink directions. These technologies are called 4th Generation
(4G) networks that rapidly spread over the world. This leads to more needs of higher bit
rate and lesser delay to serve a large number of users.

The AKA protocol is continuously evaluated and developed by 3GPP. The develop-
ment of this protocol has been started from 2G-AKA [6], 3G-AKA [7], or UMTS-AKA
until 4G networks version EPS-AKA [8]. The development is ongoing to use AKA in 5G
networks [9].

The future 5G networks will have extraordinary improvements in data rate, system
capacity, energy consumption, and massive device connectivity. Mostly, the AKA security
protocol that is used in the 4G networks will be used in the future 5G networks with some
improvements.

The integration or interworking between the aforementioned different wireless net-
works is established via connecting those networks to the HSS server in LTE home
network. The HSS server must authenticate any user connecting to the interworking
architecture. Figure 1 shows a simplified LTE-WLAN-WiMAX interworking architecture
where the 3GPP Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting server (3AAAS); Proxy
AAA server (PAAAS); and Wireless AAA server (WAAAS) play a role of the bridge node
between LTE, WiMAX, and WLAN domains. Those servers are connected via STa or Wa
interfaces to perform authentication and re-authentication procedures.

A simplified domain of LTE network includes the radio part, which is identified as the
evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (CUTRAN). This part includes one or
more Evolved Node-B (eNBs). The other part is the packet core, which is identified as the
Evolved Packet Core (EPC). It consists of HSS, Mobility Management Entity (MME), and
Serving Gateway (S-GW). The total system is identified as the EPS. This structure makes
LTE simple, scalable to be interoperable with legacy networks such as UMTS and other
wireless networks. In addition, it makes LTE efficient to widely use the internet protocols
and applications [10].

A WLAN domain includes the WAAAS, which may control one or several Access Points
(APs), whereas WiMAX network domain includes the Access Service Network (ASN),
which is the access network of WiMAX. It contains one or several BSs and ASN Gateways
(ASN-GWs). The ASN is an interface between the Connectivity Service Network (CSN)
and MSs or the Subscriber Stations (SSs).

3.2 Standard Full EAP-AKA’ Authentication Protocol (AKAP)

The full authentication protocol is invoked whenever the user connects to a new network
domain for the first time. Unlike previous studies, this work employs the improved EAP-
AKA’ protocol rather than the EAP-AKA protocol [2]. This is due to its advantages in the
security aspects. In the EAP-AKA’ protocol, the Access Network Identity (ANID) [11] is
used to derive Integrity Key (IK) and Ciphering Key (CK), to be named as IK’ and CK’,

respectively. The usage of ANID leads to specify the generated keys for a particular net-
work that is provided in ANID; therefore, it ensures that the same ANID is only used by the
parties involved in the authentication procedure. Moreover, it adds an additional protec-
tion against compromised node by limiting the attacker choices and allowing identifying
the compromised networks. The additional keys are derived from IK’ and CK’ rather
than from JK and CK. The manner of deriving Master Session Key (MSK), Extended MSK
(EMSK), Transient Session Key (TSK), Authentication Key (Kj,,;,), and Encryption Key
(Kenc) is considerably different as compared to the manner of derivation in the EAP-AKA
protocol. The EAP-AKA’ protocol uses SHA-256 (256-bit hash) [12], which is stronger
and more popular than SHA-1 (160 bits hash) [13] that is used in EAP-AKA.

More details about this protocol can be found in our previous work in [14].

3.3. Standard Fast EAP-AKA’ Re-authentication Protocol (FAKAP)

The 3GPP has specified fast re-authentication to reduce authentication delay and com-
munication overhead between the HSS and other nodes [15]. To achieve this, the full
EAP-AKA’ credentials are not used in fast re-authentication, and HSS is not involved. The
protocol mechanism is started by sending a user identity request message from the AP
to the UE. The UE replies with a response message that contains a re-authentication ID,
which was derived in the previous full EAP-AKA’. For more details about this protocol,

refer to our previous work in [14].

3.4 Related works
Recent studies of authentication and re-authentication protocols in the heteroge-
neous networks [16, 17], and [18] are designed based on the EAP-AKA protocol [19].

Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 6 of 34

However, they still suffer from UID and LNAS attacks. In literature, many studies such
as [20] and [21] have been proposed to solve the limitations of EAP-AKA and improve
the handover process. However, they are based on asymmetric key methods that might
require additional processing capability in the VE. Moreover, other methods require mod-
ification in the architecture or adding new entities. For LTE networks, the enhanced
protocol in [22] has solved the problem of UID attack, but it has been designed for non-
trusted wireless networks. In addition, it has not been designed for handover process.
The work in [4] can be used with minor modification to perform the authentication pro-
cess with untrusted networks, since it has a tunnel phase that can protect the rest of
the protocol procedure. However, it has not been designed for handover process. This
work presents authentication and re-authentication protocols that overcome the afore-
mentioned limitations. The details of the proposed protocols are in the next section.
The work in [23] has proposed authentication and re-authentication protocols to reduce
the delay and cost; however, handovers to LTE network have not been considered. In
[24], another authentication method called EAP-CRA has been proposed for different
wireless networks such as WLAN, WiMAX, and LTE networks. A single set of creden-
tials is used with any network, which reduces the time of authentication and reduces
the messages exchanged between entities. However, many channels between nodes are
assumed to be secure; thus, this method could be vulnerable to many attacks when it is
implemented. In addition, it needs modifying the network infrastructure, which makes
it difficult to be implemented. In [25] and [26], efficient group-based authentication
and re-authentication protocols for 5G networks and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN)
have been proposed. However, they are limited to LTE-WLAN interworking and WMN,

respectively.

4 Proposed authentication protocols

The proposed protocols have many features that make them more secure and faster than
others. These features makes them good substitute for the 4G and the next 5G generation.
In the proposed protocols, the signaling between UE and the AS in the home network is
reduced. This is achieved by employing the delegation concept in the re-authentication
processes [27]. The AS performs a full authentication protocol with UE during the first
connection. In the next authentication process, when the UE requires reconnection to the
same network, the AS delegates the re-authentication and key distribution process to the
local server in the serving network.

The HSS server maintains the database of users and other network entities such as
APs/BSs/eNBs, GWs, and AAA servers. A part of this database is a table that contains the
IDs of UEs, the corresponding keys, and the MSI. This mechanism takes some concepts
from the Kerberos method [28].

In the beginning of the authentication process, the UE is not required to send its JMSI
or to perform encryption operations to protect its identity. Instead, the user sends its ID
and ANID in a clear text. According to the received ID, the HSS retrieves the key and
IMSI. ANID is used by HSS to derive the appropriate keys for the specified network. A
unified key hierarchy for the LTE-WLAN-WiMAX architecture is proposed in the next

section.
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105

4.1 Unified key hierarchy

A unified key hierarchy is proposed to be applied in each network type in the
interworking architecture. For instance, in WLAN networks, the MSK and EMSK are
required to be sent to UE and AS; in WiMAX networks, the Pairwise Master Key (PMK)
and Authorization Key (AK) are required to be sent to BS and derived in MS; in LTE net-
works, the Kenps key is required to be sent to eNB and derived in VE. In addition, the
Master Key (MK) is corresponding to Kysye, which is used in EPS-AKA. The Kysye key
is derived using IK, CK while MK is derived using IK’, CK’. The unified key hierarchy
includes all keys that are required for each network type. Figure 2 illustrates the unified
key hierarchy.

Two-level keys are proposed, one for re-authentication, which its name ends with
“r’ and the other for handover, which its name ends with “’ Separation between re-
authentication and handover keys is useful to provide a higher level of control on different
security values [23]. This concept is applied as part of the new key hierarchy that is pro-
posed in this work with modification to be suitable for EAP-AKA’ protocol. The key
hierarchy of EAP-AKA’ authentication protocol [1] is adapted to be applied on key deriva-
tion in LTE and WiMAX authentication protocols. The keys in the proposed protocols
are named based on the type of network and handover. For example, in the name of key
NLK,,“N” denotes to WLAN network, “L” denotes that it is used locally, and “r” denotes
that it is used for the re-authentication process.

The Message Authentication Code (MAC) messages are also named based on the
network and the protocol type. For example, in the following name of MAC message
ANMACwy, “A” denotes to intra handover, “N” denotes to WLAN networks, and “WU”
meaning that the message originated in the WAAAS is intended to UE. In addition,
the challenge messages are also named in the same way. For instance, in the challenge

message “RX3PC, “R” denotes to inter handover, “X” denotes to WiMAX networks, and
“3P” meaning that the challenge message originated in the 3AAAS is intended to PAAAS.

Unlike the standard protocols, EMSK key is used to derive two-level handover keys for
WLAN networks, handover WLAN Network level Key (NNK;,), and handover WLAN
Local level Key (NLK;),). The same two-level keys are derived from EMSK in the case of
WiMAX or LTE networks. The keys, MSK, Kgyths Kencs Kre, and EMSK are derived from
MK as in the standard key hierarchy. The re-authentication key Kye is modified to be
re-authentication WLAN Network level Key NNK;, and re-authentication WLAN Local
level Key NLK,. The same two-level keys in the case of WiMAX or LTE networks. For
space reasons, the keys Kj,;;, and Keyc are named K, and Ke, respectively, in the rest of this
paper. In the following sections, the proposed set of authentication and re-authentication
protocols is presented.

4.2 Protocols for handover to WLAN networks
This section presents the enhanced EAP-AKA’ protocol and the new re-authentication
protocols such as the inter and intra WLAN re-authentication protocols.

4.2.1 Enhanced EAP-AKA’ Protocol (EAKAP)

The EAKAP protocol is invoked upon the following cases, if the UE connects to the
WLAN for first time, the timer is expired, or if the number of re-authentications exceeds,
the number of allowed re-authentication processes (vp).

Additional keys are generated in this protocol to be used in the inter and intra WLAN
re-authentication protocols. This section presents the modifications that have been
applied to this protocol. These modifications aim to reduce the communication between
UE and HSS and to improve the security aspects using an efficient key exchange method.

To prevent the UID attack, the IMSI is not sent by VE, instead a temporary ID, which is
called user ID (UEjp) is sent by the VE to the HSS. The HSS maintains a table that contains
UEjp for each VE, corresponding JMSI, the pre-shared key K, and an extra field to store
nonces that are received from UE. In the first authentication procedure, when the HSS
receives the message that contains the WE 7p and nonce of UE, it finds the corresponding
K and IMSI. The key K is used to generate the Authentication Vector (AV). At the end
of EAKAP protocol, a new re-authentication id is generated to be used in the next re-
authentication process.

In addition, a new key hierarchy for the enhanced EAP-AKA’ protocol is proposed
as part of the unified key hierarchy to handle the different types of HO protocols.
Unlike EAP-AKA, a key for re-authentication K,,. is derived in EAP-AKA’ from MK
key. In the proposed key hierarchy, K;e is considered as a re-authentication key for
network level. It is named WLAN Network level Key for re-authentication (NNK;,),
and the handover keys are derived from the EMSK key. The details of key derivation
are provided in the protocol steps. Figure 3 shows the enhanced EAP-AKA’ proto-
col. For space reasons, the only proposed mechanism is clarified in the following

steps:

e The UE sends a user response identity message to the WAAAS. This message
contains its ID WE;p, ANID, and its nonce for the current authentication i (Ry,),
then, the WAAAS attaches its nonce Ry, and forwards the message to HSS through
the 3AAAS.

e The HSS uses the WEjp to retrieve the IMSI and the keys of the UE and WAAAS.

e After that, HSS generates the AV and sends it to the 3AAAS, which generates the
keys Ke, Kg, Kre, MSK, and EMSK, then it attaches those keys in a challenge message
to WAAAS (N3WC) using Eq. (1). The challenge message indicates that the 3AAAS
delegates and provides the WAAAS with the key materials to perform the rest of the
authentication process. The main part of the message contains Random number
(RAND), Authentication Token (AUTN), MAC, and a challenge from the 3AAAS to
UE (N3UC) as follows:

N3UC = {Rw,, NAR, DR}K,
N3WC = {Ke, Ka, NNK;, NNKy, MCR, nar} kay (1)

where MCR is the maximum value of the counter of re-authentication process (Cp),
nap is the number of allowed intra re-authentication processes, and Ke, Kg, and
NNK,, are derived from MK. Those keys are substrings of bits [0..127], [128..383], and
[384..639], respectively. The key NNK;, is derived using Eq. (2). In this paper, NNK,
and NNK;, are the network level keys for re-authentication and handover,

respectively.

NNK;, = F(EMSK, |Rw,|Wip|MSM|“NNKh", 256), (2)
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 10 of 34

where F is a key derivation function [19], MSM is the UE address in MAC layer,
“NNKh’” is the key label, W7p is the ID of WAAAS, and 256 is the key length in bits.

e The WAAAS forwards RAND, AUTN, MAC, and N3UC to UE and stores N3WC,

e When UE receives the message, it checks MAC. If the checking process is successful,
it derives the required keys. After that, the UE computes the RES and MAC and
sends them in the EAP response challenge message to WAAAS.

e Upon receiving the message, WAAAS checks MAC and compares the Expected
Response (XRES) with the RES value that has been sent from UE. If the checking
process is successful, it generates NLK, using Eq. (3), then it sends it along with the
successful message to AP.

NLK,. = F(NNK,, C4p\|AP1p|MSM|“NLKr", 512) (3)

where Cp is the counter of intra re-authentication process and APyp is the ID of AP.
e AP stores the NLK, key and forwards the message to UE, which starts to derive the
NIK, key.
e UEand WAAAS derive a WLAN Re-authentication Identity (NRID;), which is used
for the next re-authentication process. NRID; is derived as follows:

NRID; = SH(NNK,, NNKj,|Ru,); (4)
where SH is a secure hash function.

4.2.2 Inter WLAN Re-authentication Protocol (RNRP)

To reduce the overhead on the HSS server, the 3AAAS performs the RNRP protocol on
behalf of the HSS server using the key materials that have been sent from HSS server
during the previous EAKAP protocol. The RNRP is performed when the user needs an
HO to anew WLAN network domain in the interworking environment. After executing
the RNRP protocol in a WLAN domain, RNRP gives permission and prepares the key
materials to VE and WAAAS for future Intra handover within this domain. Figure 4 and
the following steps describe this protocol.

e The UE sends the NRIDj_; to WAAAS. NRIDj_, has been derived using Eq. (4) in
the previous EAKAP protocol.

e Upon receiving the message, WAAAS validates NRID;_; to check whether the UE
has previously visited this domain or not. Then, it forwards NRIDj;_, along with its
nonce Ry, to the 3AAAS. Ry, will be sent to VE, which will send it again to WAAAS
in the future re-authentication process. Thus, the WAAAS can verify the UE.

e The 3AAAS computes its MAC, which is intended to UE RNMAC3y and a challenge
(RN3UC) to UE as shown in Eq. (5).

RNMAC3y = SH (Kg, NRID;|Ru,_, |Rw;)
RN3UC = {NRID;, nar, Rw; }x, (5)

Note that the value Ry,_, is the nonce of UE that has been sent by VE to the 3AAAS
in the previous EAKAP protocol. When UE receives this nonce, it can verify the
3AAAS. Each time the Cr exceeds nap, the full authentication EAKAP is invoked.

e After that, it prepares a delegation message, which is intended to WAAAS containing
MCr, nar, NNK,;, and NNK;,. This message will be used in the future ANRP

protocol, and it is encrypted by the shared key between WAAAS and 3AAAS K3y,
using Eq. (6). Then, it sends it along with RNMAC3y and RN3UC to WAAAS.

RN3WC = {Ke, Ka, NNK,;, NNKj,, MCR, NAR} Ky (6)

e The WAAAS stores RN3WC and forwards RNMAC3,; and RN3UC to UE via AP.

named as RNMAC yw anda challenge to WAAAS RNUWC as shown in Eq. (7).

of successful verification, it derives NLK, key using Eq. (8) and sends it in the EAP

success message to AP.
NLK), = F(NNK;,,, C4r|APip|MSM|“NLKh", 512) (8)

e Finally, the AP stores the NLK;, key and forwards the message to UE, which starts to
derive NLK;, that is used to protect messages between VE and AP.

4.2.3. Intra WLAN Re-authentication Protocol (ANRP)

Instead of using standard fast re-authentication protocol, the ANRP is performed when
the user moves within the same WLAN domain or to another domain in the interworking
environment that was previously visited. Figure 5 and the following steps describe this
protocol.

e The UE sends the previous NRID;_; to WAAAS.

e WAAAS receives NRID;_1, then it checks the value of counter C4pr to ensure that it
does not exceed the np. If the checking is successful, it generates ANMAC wy anda
challenge ANWUC as shown in Eq. (9), then it sends it along in the challenge
message to UE.

ANMACwy = SH(Ka, Rw; |Car)
ANWUC = {Car Rw; }k, (9)

e When UE receives the message from WAAAS, it verifies the challenge, and it
matches the value of counter Cp with the stored value. If it matches, it generates
ANMACyw and a challenge ANUWC as shown Eq. (10), then it sends it along in the
EAP response challenge message.

ANMACuw = SH (Kg, Rw;|Car|Cr)
ANUWC = {Capr, Cr, Rw; }K, (10)

e The WAAAS checks whether the received Car matches the C4p sent in the previous
message or not. If it matches, it verifies the received MAC. If the verification is
successful, it increments the counter Cyr and derives NLK;, key and sends it with
EAP success message to AP.

e Upon successful authentication, the counters Cyr and Cr in UE are increased by 1.
The UE starts deriving the NLK;, key.

4.3 Protocols for handover to WiMAX networks

The INEA protocol has been specified by WiMAX Forum in [29] and [30] to provide
mutual authentication between mobile station (MS) and 3A AAS in the 3G-WiMAX inter-
working architecture. This section presents the enhanced INEA protocol, the inter, and
intra WiMAX re-authentication protocols.

4.3.1 Enhanced INEA Protocol (EINEAP)

The EINEAP is performed if the UE connects to the WiMAX for first time. It is also
performed if the timer is expired or if the number of re-authentication processes exceeds
the nz. Otherwise, the re-authentication protocols of WiMAX are invoked. The INEA
protocol starts when the user receives the request identity message from ASN-GW. The
rest of the protocol steps are illustrated in Fig. 6 and summarized as follows:

e The UE sends UWEjp, Ry,, and ANID to ASN-GW via BS. When ASN-GW receives
EAP response identity message from UE, it attaches its nonce Rgj and forwards the
message to HSS through PAAAS and 3AAAS.

e When the 3AAAS receives the message, it stores the nonces and forwards the other
values to HSS in AV request message.

e The HSS uses the received IDs to retrieve the shared keys and IMSI of the user. It
uses the user key K to generate the AV and sends it along with the retrieved keys to
the 3AAAS.

e The 3AAAS generates the network re-authentication level key from the MK key. In
this protocol, this key is called re-authentication WiMAX Network level Key (XNK,,.).
In addition, the 3AAAS generates the handover key XNK;, as illustrated in Eq. (11). It
delegates the rest of the authentication to PAAAS by sending the derived keys to
PAAAS in a challenge message, which is encrypted by the shared key between
3AAAS and PAAAS as shown in Eq. (12).

XNK), = F(EMSK, Rg, |Gip|MSM|“XNKh", 256) (11)
where Gyp is the ID of GW.

X3PC = {K3G, Ke, Ka, nar, XNK,, XNKj,, MCR} K3p (12)
It also generates a challenge message to UE as shown in Eq. (13).

X3UC = {RG;, NAR, MR}K (13)

e The 3AAAS sends RAND, AUTN, MAC, X3UC, and X3PC to the PAAAS in the
request AKA challenge message. The PAAAS then forwards RAND, AUTN, MAC,
and X3UC challenge to VE and stores X3PC challenge.

e When UE receives the message, it verifies MAC. In the case of successful verification,
it computes the RES and its MAC. Then, the UE sends those values in the response
AKA challenge message to the PAAAS.

e When the PAAAS receives the message, it verifies the received values, then it
generates WiMAX local re-authentication keys XLK, and XLK;, using Eq. (14) and
uses them with MCpr and nap to generate a challenge message that is intended to
ASN-GW using Eq. (15). This challenge message is called XPGC, and it is encrypted
using K3g that is retrieved from X3PC, then it sends it to ASN-GW in the EAP
success message. It sets the value of Cap according to the received n4p value.

XLK, = F(XNK;, Car|BS1p|MSM|“XLKr", 512)
XLK), = F(XNKy, Car|BSip|MSM|‘XLKh", 512) (14)

where BSjp is the ID of BS.
XPGC = {XLK,, XLKj,, MCR, nr; Kes Ka} kag (15)

e Then, the ASN-GW uses the received local level keys to compute PMK, and AK;
using Eqs. (16) and (17), and it sets the counter Cyr according to the n,4p value.

PMK, = TF(XLK,, 160), (16)
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 15 of 34

where TF is the truncate function used in [31].
AK, = F(PMK,., C4r|BSip|MSM|“AkKr", 160) (17)

e After that, the ASN-GW sends the AK; key with the success message to BS, which
forwards the message to UE and stores the AK, key.

e The UE and ASN-GW derive a WiMAX Re-authentication Identity (XRID;), which is
used for the next re-authentication process as follows:

XRID; = SH(XNK;, XNKy\Ru,) (18)

4.3.2 Inter WiMAX Re-authentication Protocol (RXRP)

The RXRP is performed when the user needs to perform an HO from WLAN or LTE
domain to a BS in WiMAX domain for the first time. The RXRP protocol has the same
mechanism of RNRP except that the challenges and keys generated are dedicated for
WiMAX networks.

4.3.3, Intra ASN WiMAX Re-authentication Protocol (AXRP)

AXRP is performed when the user is moving from a BS to another one within the same
domain or moving to a previously visited ASN-GW. The ASG-GW will authenticate the
UE on behalf of the 3AAAS using the keys and values that have been received in the
previous EINEAP. The AXRP protocol has the same mechanism of ANRP except that the
challenges and keys generated are dedicated for WiMAX networks.

4.4 Protocols for handover to LTE networks
This section presents the enhanced EPS protocol and the inter and intra LTE re-
authentication protocols.

4.4.1 Enhanced EPS Authentication Protocol (EEPSP)

In this work, the EPS-AKA protocol is enhanced to be used for trusted wireless networks.
The networks involved in this work are considered as trusted networks, since WiMAX
uses licensed radio spectrum and WLAN uses 802.1x—based authentication, which
requires encryption and uses EAP-based authentication [32]. The EEPSP is designed to
be appropriate for the subsequent types of handovers. It is invoked when the user con-
nects to LTE for the first time. It is also invoked when the timer is expired or the number
of re-authentication processes using the same key materials exceeds the nr. The entities
involved in this protocol are MME, 3AAAS, and HSS servers. As mentioned in the previ-
ous section, the unified key hierarchy is also adapted to be suitable for LTE networks. The
protocol mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 7 and in the following steps:

e The UE sends UWEjp, Ry,, and ANID to HSS via MME.

e When MME receives the EAP response identity message from UE, it attaches its
nonce Ry, and forwards the message to HSS.

e The HSS uses WEjp to retrieve IMSI and the pre-shared key K. It uses K to generate
the AV and sends it to the 3AAAS.

e Then, the 3AAAS generates MSK, EMSK, and Keng. The Keng key is derived from
MK key using Eq. (20). It is considered as network level re-authentication key, and it
is named LTE Network level Key for re-authentication (ENK,) in this protocol. The
3AAAS also generates LTE Network level Key for handover (ENK;,) using Eq. (20).

e After that, the 3AAAS delegates the rest of the authentication process to MME by
sending the derived keys to MME. The keys Knasine and Knasenc are derived from
EMSK key [33] using Eq. (19). In this protocol, the ENK, key and Cyr counter
correspond to the NH key and NCC counter used in the standard protocol.

Knasint|KNASenc = PRF(EMSK)), (19)

where PRF is a pseudo-random function. These keys are used to protect the data in
the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) layer.

ENK, = MK([384..639]

ENK;), = F(EMSK, Ry,\Mip|MSM|“ENKh" , 256) (20)
In addition, the 3AAAS generates challenges to MME and UE using Eq. (21) as
follows:

E3UC = {Rm \ar\"R}K.

EEMC = {Kens|ENKy|MCa|nar} Key (21)

e The 3AAAS also extracts RAND and AUTN from the received AV and sends them
along with E3UC and EEMC to MME in the request AKA challenge message. The

Page 16 of 34
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 17 of 34

MME then, forwards RAND, AUTN, MAC, and E3UC challenge to UE and stores
EEMC challenge.

e The UE verifies MAC. In the case of successful verification, it computes the RES and
its MAC.

e Then, the VE sends the computed values in the response AKA challenge message to
MME.

e When the MME receives the message, it verifies the received MAC and RES. In case
of successful verification, it generates LTE Local level keys for re-authentication and
handover ELK, using Eq. (22), then it sends ELK, along with the successful message
to eNB.

ELK, = F(ENK;, Car|eNBp|MSM|“ELKr’, 512) (22)

e When eNB receives the message, it stores the ELK, key and forwards the message to
UE, which starts to derive the keys.

e Finally, the UE and MME derive LTE re-authentication identity (ERID;), which is
used for the next re-authentication process as follows:

ERID; = SH(ENK,, ENK;,|Ru;) (23)

4.4.2 Inter LTE Re-authentication Protocol (RERP)

The RERP is performed when the user moves to another MME within the same domain.
It is also performed when the user performs an HO from WiMAX or WLAN networks to
LTE network. The mutual authentication between the 3AAAS and UE is done without the
need to communicate with HSS. In this protocol, the 3AAAS delegates the MME to per-
form the future re-authentication process. The RERP protocol has the same mechanism
of ANRP except that the challenges and keys generated are dedicated for LTE networks.

4.4.3 Intra LTE Re-authentication Protocol (AERP)

The AERP is invoked when the user is roaming from eNB1 to eNB2 within the same LTE
domain or performing an HO from other networks to a previously visited LTE domain.
In AERP, the mutual authentication is done between UE and MME without the need to
communicate with 3AAAS or HSS servers. MME uses the key materials that have been
received when RERP was invoked. The AERP protocol has the same mechanism of ANRP
except that the challenges and keys generated are dedicated for LTE networks.

5 Security analysis

5.1 Security features and robustness

In this section, the security properties of the proposed protocols are analyzed to demon-
strate that the proposed protocols can satisfy the security requirements [34] and [35].

5.1.1 Mutual authentication

Full/fast EAP-AKA, INEA, and EPS-AKA authentication/re-authentication protocols
achieve mutual authentication between UE and the 3AAAS server. The proposed authen-
tication protocols provide a secure mutual authentication to prevent several attacks such
as MITM, impersonation, and rogue AP/BS attacks. In the local re-authentication proto-
cols, the 3AAAS server delegates the authentication operation to the local servers WAAA,
PAAA, and MME. The local servers and UE mutually authenticate each other by checking
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 18 of 34

their MACs and proving that they have the correct nonces and counters. The legitimacy of
local servers WAAA, PAAA, and MME is verified by checking their counters Cr and Cyp.
The UE matches the received counters with the counters stored in its database. Successful
matching indicates that the keys K, and K, that are used to encrypt counters and MAC
are valid. In the same way, the local servers authenticate UE by checking the counters and
MACs, since only the legitimate UEs can generate the keys Ke and Kg.

5.1.2 Protection of message integrity

MAC is appended with the authentication challenges/response messages that are
exchanged between UE and AS in the interworking environment. It protects the integrity
of those messages. In addition, it provides authentication for the sender. The sender
of MAC attaches the previous nonce of the receiver in its MAC, then the receiver can
authenticate the sender by checking that nonce. For example, in RERP protocol, UE
receives the nonce of MME during the previous authentication process, which was called
Ry,. In the current authentication process, UE includes that nonce of MME, which is
called Ry,_, in its MAC (REMACy pm); thus, MME authenticates UE by checking this

nonce.

5.1.3 Identity protection

Concealing the UE’s identity helps to prevent UID attack. Most recent solutions use
temporary identities to conceal the JMSI; however, JMSJ is still sent in the full authenti-
cation process, which makes them vulnerable to UID attack. In the proposed protocols,
the JMSI is not sent, instead, a temporary user identity WE7p is sent in the full authen-
tication process and re-authentication identity RID is computed and sent in the next
re-authentication process. When the HSS receives LIE7p, it uses it as a pointer to retrieve
the MSI and the pre-shared key. In the full authentication and the subsequent re-
authentication processes, UE and local servers must derive new ID using Eqs. (4), (18),
and (23), since those IDs are only used for a single authentication process.

In the standard full authentication protocols, the 3AAAS server must generate a re-
authentication ID that will be used for future fast re-authentication process. Whereas
in the proposed protocols, the 3AAAS server is exonerated from computing and saving
the re-authentication IDs. In addition, the re-authentication IDs are not encrypted in the
proposed protocols, instead, those IDs are sent in clear text since they will not be used in
the future re-authentication process.

5.1.4 Forward and backward secrecy

In the proposed protocols, the shared keys are desired to be different in each commu-
nication session to achieve one of the security requirements, which is the key freshness.
After each handover process, fresh keys are computed using fresh nonces. This property
also helps in limiting the number of cipher texts that can be used by some attackers. In
addition, the proposed protocols provide a perfect forward and backward secrecy and
prevent domino effect attacks [36]. The UE and AP/BS/eNB compute and share fresh
keys K;, which can only be used in the ith authentication process. Those keys cannot
be used to decrypt messages in the previous authentication process ith-1, which provide
backward secrecy. In addition, any messages exchanged in the ith+1 authentication pro-
cess cannot be decrypted by those keys, which provide forward secrecy. The VE and local
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105 Page 19 of 34

servers derive network level keys NNK, XNK, and ENK. Those keys are computed using
fresh nonces R,, Rg, and Ry in Eq. (2), (11), and (20), respectively. This guarantees the
freshness of all keys that will be computed from NNK, XNK, and ENK keys. In the intra
re-authentication protocols, local keys NLK, XLK, and ELK are derived from NNK, XNK,
and ENK, respectively. These local keys are different from the local keys in the previous
intra re-authentication process. They are fresh as well since they are derived using new
counter Cp.

5.2 Verifying the proposed protocols

The proposed protocols are validated using one of the well known analytical tools for
checking the secrecy of authentication protocols, the Automated Validation of Internet
Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tools [37, 38]. The AVISPA tools consider
all types of attacks that target the network security protocols. It uses the High Level
Protocol Specification Language (HLPSL) to allow specifying security protocols to find
possible attacks. The protocol’s behavior is analyzed and certain goals are checked using
several back-ends. Generally, there are several back-ends defined by AVISPA, and they
can be freely chosen to execute the HLPSL code after it is translated by HLPSL2IF into an
Intermediate Format (IF).

In this work, each description of the proposed protocols is written using HLPLS lan-
guage. Then, the On-the-fly Model-Checker (OFMC) and Constraint-Logic based Attack
Searcher (CL-ATSE) back-ends are used to verify those protocols. This is mainly due to
their interesting features such as supporting various security protocols, checking whether
the verified protocol is able to provide strong authentication, and secrecy. The most
important feature is proving the lack of security in the protocol rather than proving its
security. The complete protocol description contains several parts. First, the function role
A, which describes the behavior of the party A during the protocol session. The function
role session is composed of each party’s role. The function role environment describes the
protocol execution under attack. Finally, the authentication requirements are defined in
the part of goals.

All proposed authentication and re-authentication protocols are separately coded and
verified by AVSPA tools. As an example, the code, simulation, goals, and results of
RNRP protocol are presented in this section. The role of the UE and the goals that
need to be verified are excerpted from the complete code and illustrated in Fig. 8.
The goals that need to be verified are illustrated in Fig. 9. The run simulation of
RNRP protocol is shown in Fig. 10. In this work, both authentication and secrecy
goals are verified. The authentication goal is checked using the command authentica-
tion_on rwl. This indicates that when the UE sends its fresh nonce rwl to 3AAAS,
it requires that the UE and the 3AAAS should agree on that nonce and exist in the
current state. The secrecy goal is checked using the command secrecy_of nnk1, which
indicates that the nonce nnk1l should be secreted and the intruder cannot learn such
value. If the protocol is insecure or vulnerable to any authentication or secrecy attack,
the result indicates that it is unsafe; otherwise, it is safe. Figure 11 shows the result of
running the RNRP protocol using OFMC and ATSE tools, it shows that the protocol
is safe.

In this section, the performance of the proposed protocols is evaluated and analyzed
in terms of handover delay, key size, communication overhead, average handover cost,
and energy consumption. These terms are important factors during handover process
in the 4G and the next 5G networks. To do that, four different algorithms for the user

movements in the heterogeneous network environment are considered. Algorithm 1 (A/)
represents the standard authentication protocols EAP-AKA’, INEA, and EPS-AKA [2].
Those protocols are invoked whenever the UE connects to a new network domain. Algo-
rithm 2 (A2) represents the use of fast re-authentication protocols [15], which are invoked
whenever the user connects to a previously visited network domain. In addition, algo-
rithm 3 (A3) represents Coordinated Robust Authentication and re-authentication pro-
tocols (CRA) [24]. Whereas the proposed authentication and re-authentication protocols
are invoked in algorithm 4 (A4) of the UE movements (handovers) model.

The UE moves in a fixed path as illustrated in Fig. 12, it initially establishes a connec-
tion to the LTE network and then moves to WLAN1 domain that controlled by WAAAS1.
Next, the UE performs a vertical HO to WiMAX network. After that, the UE recon-
nects to the previously visited WLANI1 domain. Then, it moves to the previously visited

domain. Finally, the UE moves to WLAN2 domain that controlled by WAAAS2.

In Al, seven standard authentication protocols are invoked to perform the authentica-
tion process during UE handovers. Four standard authentication protocols and three fast
re-authentication protocols are invoked in A2. Four full coordinated robust authentica-
tion (FCRA) protocols and three coordinated robust re-authentication (CRR) protocols
are invoked in A3. In A4, the UE establishes a connection to the LTE domain and per-
forms either EAKAP or EEPSP authentication protocol via eNB1. When the UE moves
to WLANI1, an Inter WLAN re-authentication protocol is invoked with the AP1 residing
in WLANI1. Next, the UE moves to WiMAX domain and performs an Inter WiMAX re-
authentication protocol. The next movement is to the previously visited WLANI1 domain,
where an Intra WLAN re-authentication protocol is invoked. After that, the UE moves to
the previously visited LTE domain and performs an Intra LTE re-authentication protocol.
Subsequently, the UE moves to the previously visited WiMAX domain and performs an
Intra WiMAX re-authentication protocol. Finally, the UE moves to WLAN2 and performs
an Inter WLAN re-authentication protocol.

6.1 Handover delay

This section provides an analytical model for LTE-WLAN-WiMAX interworking to eval-
uate the proposed and other algorithms in terms of handover delay where the user is
performing a sequential vertical and horizontal handovers between those networks. In
this model, the network of Fig. 1 is modeled in Fig. 13. The variable TDgg is corresponding
to TDeg in LTE network; TDp z is corresponding to TDey and TDw, in LTE and WLAN
networks, respectively; TDpg is corresponding to TDyg; and TDp , is corresponding to
TDyz and TDw,. The random variables of WiMAX network TDgy, TDgc, TDpcG, and
the corresponding variables in LTE and WLAN are exponentially distributed with mean

The four algorithms that will be studied in this model are represented by A, where A

modeled using the parameter HD“. Equation (24) illustrates the probability distribution
function (PDE) for HD4.

In this model, m is the authentication or re-authentication protocol that can be invoked in
each algorithm, P,,, is the ratio of invoking the method m, and M4 represents the protocols
in each algorithm. For example, if A represents Al, then M4 = {AKAP, INEAP, EPSP}
and M4 = {AKAP, FAKAP, INEAP, FINEAP, EPSP, FEPSP} when A represents A2, where
FEPSP and FINEAP are the fast EPS and fast INEAP protocols, respectively. In the case
of A represents A3, M4 = {FCRA, CRR}, while M4 = {EAKAP, EINEAP, EEPSP, RNRP,
ANRP, RXRP, AXRP, RERP, AERP} for the proposed algorithm A4. According to [39],
Eq. (24) can be expressed using Laplace transform in Eq. (25) as follows:

The HD“ contains different delay values; thus, it can be represented in a generic form

using the convolution operator ® as expressed in Eq. (26).

Subd (C) =S¥ 04 HD,(t) = (®;co4 fui) (26)

Under the condition m, the ®4 is a set that represents the components of delay in

algorithm A. The Laplace transform for HD“ can be written as follows:

Sips (s) =SS HD(s) — (Ticos itp, ) (27)

Authentication delay is one of the delay components HD;, and the other component is
the transmission time. Equation (28) demonstrates the methods (protocols) that can be

invoked during user movements in algorithms Al, A2, A3, and A4.

According to [30] and [39], Pr represents the values of Pep and Ppp, and it varies
between 0 and 1. The processing time of full authentication protocols (FP) and fast re-
authentication protocols (RP) are 1240 and 600 ms, respectively. The hop count between
GW and the AS is set to 4.

Figure 14 shows the performance of the proposed and other algorithms in terms of
handover delay when the value of Pr increases from 0 to 1. It demonstrates that, when Pr
is 0.1, the proposed and other algorithms experience convergent values of handover delay.
This is because of performing full authentication protocols in the proposed and other
algorithms during the first connection. When Pr increases the handover delay in Al, A2,

A3, and A4 algorithms is gradually increased until it reaches to 10560 ms, 8640 ms, 8340
ms, and 5900 ms, respectively.

Figure 15 shows how is the handover delay in each algorithm affected by increasing the
hop count between the local servers and the 3AAAS. The value of handover delay in A4
is slightly affected by increasing the hop count compared to other algorithms. This is due
to performing the intra authentication protocols which are not affected by the number
of hop count since there is no communication between the local servers and 3AAAS.

The local re-authentication protocols ANRP, AXRP, and AERP are not affected when the
number of hop count between the WAAAS / PAAAS / MME and the 3AAAS is increased.
The slight increasing in handover delay with H is due to invoking RNRP, RXRP, and RERP
protocols, which requires contacting the 3AAAS. Figure 16 shows the performance of the
proposed algorithm compared to the standard and other algorithms in terms of handover
delay and the number of users. The handover delay increases by increasing the number
of users in each algorithm. However, the proposed algorithm A4 achieves less handover
delay compared to Al, A2, and A3 algorithms. In general, the proposed algorithm A4
reduces the handover delay by 44%, 34%, and 29% compared to Al, A2, and A3 algorithms,
respectively.

A part of user movements is used to compare the proposed protocols with standard
protocols and the WiMAX-WLANWN authentication protocols of Shaidhani in [23]. In this
part, authentication and re-authentication protocols are invoked during handovers from
WiMAX to WLAN networks. Figure 17 shows the performance of the proposed proto-
cols compared to standard and other protocols when the hop count increases from 1 to
11. Obviously, it is shown that the handover delay is not affected significantly by increas-
ing the hop count number. This is due to the reduction of communication between the
serving network and the AS during the handover processes in the proposed protocols.
In Fig. 18, the handover delay for all protocols are almost the same when Pr is 0. This
is because at this point, the re-authentication protocols are not invoked and all methods
are starting with full authentication protocols; thus, the difference is starting to increase
gradually until it reaches to 34%.

6.2 Key size

particular protocol. The size of the exchanged and generated keys has a significant impact

on the storage cost because the other factors such as IDs, and nonce values used here
have the same impact compared to the other methods. The sum of key size is calculated
for Al, A2, A3, and A4 algorithms. Figure 19 gives a clear indication that algorithm A4
offers lesser key size compared to Al, A2, and A3 algorithms. In the first movement M1
of the user, the modified authentication protocols are invoked and the key size is larger
than the other protocols. However, it is significantly reduced during the subsequent re-
authentication processes.

During the movements M4, M5, and M6, the user moves to previously visited wireless
domains; thus, no additional keys are generated in the 3GPP AAA server and intra re-
authentication protocols are invoked with key size (1024 bits). Whereas in the movement
M7, the value of key size jumps to (2304 bits), since the user moves to a new WLAN
domain, which requires additional keys are generated in the 3AAAS server to perform
an inter re-authentication protocol. In general, the storage that is required to save the
generated keys during the user movements in the interworking architecture is reduced

using the proposed algorithm A4.

6.3. Communication overhead for authentication process

The communication overhead is the time required to perform the authentication process
during the HO process. In this section, we compare the communication overhead in the
proposed protocols with others as illustrated in Table 1, where the TD jz, is the transmis-
sion delay between UE and AP/BS, TDy4g is the transmission delay between the AP/BS
and the GW, and TDep is the transmission delay between the GW and the AAA server.

6.4 Average handover cost

To evaluate the performance of the proposed protocols in terms of handover cost, the
hexagonal wireless network model [41] is adapted as a network model and fluid flow (FF)
model [42] as mobility model. It is assumed that the sizes of each subnet are equal and
take a hexagonal shape. It is also assumed that a hexagonal network model is an LTE-
WLAN-WiMAX interworking domain and a cell is a subnet of one of the networks in the
interworking architecture. The average handover rate (A;) is given by Eq. (37).

Aj = (V.SM)/(t . GM) (37)

where j is a user group indicator and v is the average velocity of UE in the interwork-
ing environment. The perimeter S(i) of the given network domain can be computed as

follows:
S(i) = (121+ 6).R (38)

where i is the number of cells and R is the subnet radius. The coverage area G(i) can be
computed as follows:

G(i) = (2.6.R’).(3i.i+ 1) + 1) (39)
The average handover cost in time unit can be represented by,

AHC mn = dj - Co (40)
The cost of each method C,, is expressed as follows:

Cn = Cus + Cup: (41)

Cm is the signaling cost and C,, is the processing cost of the method m. The ACjy,,5 for
each algorithm can be computed as follows:

AlCys = 35Cys + 50C yg + 24H

A2Cins = 35Cws + 44Cyq + 22H

A3Cys = 35Cws + 40Cyq + 14H

A4Cns = 35 Cys + 35Cyq + 8H (42)
where C,,, and Cyq are the transmission cost on wireless and wired links, respectively. The
processing cost for each method C,,,, is composed of the processing cost of each node
Cyp- For instance, the Cy, for the EPSP protocol can be written as Cepspy = Cugy +
CMME p> where

CuE,p = Ckey + Cenc + Caec + Cver + Chash

CMME,p = Ckey + Caec + Cver P 3 Ckey + Chash + Cenc (43)
where Cyey, Cencs Caecs Crer, and Cyasy are the costs of key generation, encryption, decryp-
tion, verification, and hash function, respectively. Thus, the Cy, for Al, A2, A3, and A4
algorithms is given as follows:

A1lCinp =23Ckey + 14Cenc + 14Cgec + 14Cver + 14Chash

A2Cinp =20Ckey + 14Cenc + 14Cgec + 14Cver + 14Chash

A3Cinp =19Ckey + 14Cenc + 14Cgec + 14Cver + 14Chash

A4Cinp =14Ckey + 14 Cenc + 14Cgec + 14Cver + 14Chasn (44)
Alezabi et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2020) 2020:105

The value of i is set to 10, Cyqg is set to 20, and Cy; is set to 10. The other costs such as
key generation cost Cxey, encryption cost Cen, decryption cost Cec, verification cost Cyer,
and hash functions cost C;,;;, are set to one unit. The results obtained from the handover
cost analysis of each algorithm are shown in Fig. 20. The value of R is set to 0.1 km, and v
and H vary from 2 to 5 km/h and 1 to 7 hop count, respectively. Increasing both v and H
results in more average cost of handover in the standard and other algorithms compared
to the proposed algorithm. This is a proof that the handover cost is effectively reduced by
the proposed algorithm, which makes it suitable for such heterogeneous architecture.

Figure 21 shows the handover cost when v is set to 2 km/h, and R and H vary from 0.1
to 0.8 km and 1 to 6 hop count, respectively.

In general, when the hop count increases, the average handover cost is affected in the
case of standard and other algorithms. In the case of the proposed algorithm, the han-
dover cost is slightly affected, since the authentication process is performed by the local
servers and no need to communicate with the 3AAAS (The hop count is assumed to be
between the local servers and the 3AAAS). For instance, in the standard algorithm AJ, the
AHC increases from 1215 to 1349 when H increases from 1 to 7. Whereas in the proposed
algorithm A4, the AHC increases from 1056 to 1100. The reduction of handover cost in
the proposed algorithm A4 reaches up to 22%, 18%, and 11% compared to algorithms A 1,
A2, and A3, respectively.

6.5 Energy consumption

The 4G and the 5G networks serve a huge number of users; thus, energy consumption is
one of the most important issues that should be addressed. The reduction of the generated
keys and the number of exchanged messages during the authentication process result in
reducing energy consumption [43] and [44]. In general, the amount of energy consumed
by wireless networks can be obtained by a linear equation,

Energy = M.N+ B (45)

where WN is the total number of bytes sent or received by the UE, ™ is the incremental cost,
and B is the fixed cost. Both the incremental and fixed cost are linear coefficients which
have been computed in [45] by using experimental results for point to point model. The
energy consumption can be calculated based on the number of bytes sent and received by
UE as follows:

Ewans = 0.48N + 431
Evec = 0.12N + 316 (46)

The findings in [45] are utilized in this section to roughly calculate the energy consumed
by the UE in each movements. Then, the calculations are applied on Al, A2, A3, and A4
algorithms. Figure 22 shows that the energy consumed in AJ, A2, A3, and A4 algorithms
is increased whenever the UE performs movement (either an inter HO or intra HO) in the
LTE-WLAN-WiMAX environment. However, the energy consumption of A4 is slightly
increased in each movements compared to Al, A2, and A3 algorithms, since the number
of bytes sent and received by UE is reduced by inter and intra re-authentication proto-
cols. The proposed algorithm A4 achieves 17%, 13%, and 11% as a reduction in energy
consumption compared to Al, A2, and A3, respectively.

7 Conclusion and future work

Authentication protocols provide secure communication in the wireless networks by pre-
venting unauthorized users from using the network resources. Nevertheless, it adds delay
and overhead to the communication. These problems become more pertinent in the
environment of heterogeneous wireless networks such as 5G networks. For the sake of
avoiding the single point of failure and providing secure and fast inter and intra handovers
in the 4G and 5G networks, authentication and re-authentication protocols have been
proposed in this work. The standard authentication protocols have been enhanced to be

more secure against authentication and secrecy attacks such as UID and MITM attacks.
A new method has been proposed to protect the user identity, and this method is simple
and does not add processing capability to the UE or HSS. Then, new re-authentication
protocols have been proposed to locally perform fast re-authentication processes dur-
ing handovers to the same domain or to a previously visited domain. The results of the
analytical model show that the proposed protocols achieve better performance than the
standard and other protocols in terms of handover delay, cost, and energy consump-
tion. In addition, the verification tools show that the proposed protocols are secure and
prevent all types of authentication and secrecy attacks in such environment. The future
work could be conducted in the area of designing fault tolerant procedures which will
improve the performance of authentication protocols. Those procedures work in case of
detecting errors during the authentication process. Instead of rejecting the authentication
and restart the authentication from the first step, the fault-tolerant procedure restarts
the authentication process from the step where errors occurred; thus, the delay and cost
of authentication and re-authentication processes will be effectively reduced. Another
future work direction is to design authentication protocols for heterogeneous wireless
sensors networks (WSN) which support Internet of Things (IOT) notion. The idea could
be extended to design authentication and re-authentication protocols in the interworking
of 5G and WSN. In WSN networks, the sink is considering as an authentication server.
Each sensor node and the sink exchange the keys and perform a mutual authentication.
