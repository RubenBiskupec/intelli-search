1. INTRODUCTION

We are all aware that developing and enforcing security based on risk assessment makes sense.
Such an analysis would rely on the possibility of the threat being turned into an attack and its effect, if this
happens. Although such an assessment can differ with respect to implementations and their meaning,
a general study of the attacks points to certain patterns and directions.

The goal of organization-set password policies is to increase the security level of the used passwords
via specification of different requirements applicable when the selection process and actual use. When users
select and remotely use strong passwords, the password policies will help in protecting the the user account data
and prevent malicious activities from unauthorized users which can cause network or service-wide compromise
and harm the company further due to liability concerns. Without password user policies, users can select bad or
easily guessable passwords and their accounts can be compromised vua dictionary attacks [1].

When implemented in a security environment, port knocking can provide an additional layer of
server authentication, facilitate a defense-in - depth strategy, and mask the presence of services. Protecting
against server-driven assaults is ideal, ranging from automatic scanning as part of assault chain identification
to specifically target zero day exploitation. Port knocking solutions as a basic method for opening firewall
ports have evolved and improved significantly. Many modern port knocking implementations have gained
complexity layers from their predecessors in the process of eliminating unique vulnerabilities [2].

1.1. Theoretical back ground
1.1.1. Zero-knowledge proof
Zero-knowledge protocols allow implementation of some basic cryptographic operations, such as
identification, key exchange, etc without exposing any secret information during active conversation;
it requires smaller computational effort compared to the use of some public key protocols. This protocol is
attractive in embedded and smart cards applications [3]. As a popular concept in most cryptographic systems,
Zero-Knowledge proof involves two parties identified as the prover (A) and the verifier (B). This technique
requires the prover A to establish that he has a credential (say a credit card number) without necessarily
having to reveal the exact number to the verifier B. A Zero-Knowledge Proof is required as an authentication
system in this situation for the following reasons [4]:
- Completeness: if the statement is valid, the truthful verifier must be able to show that the statement is
accurate to an impartial verifier at all times.
- Soundness: if the statement is incorrect, it is not possible to manipulate the result (with a very small
chance) to the verifier that the statement is accurate.
- Zero-knowledge: the verifier does not know anything other than the fact that the statement is true if it is
valid. No information will be released on the specifics of the document.
Algorithm (1), describe the Zero-Knowledge Proof that used in proposed idea. The following is
a step-by-step procedure of the protocol [5]

1.1.2. Chaotic system

Chaos can be described as follow: The property of a complex system whose action is so
unpredictable as to appear random, owing to the high sensitivity to minor conditions changes. The formless
matter that was supposed to have existed before the universe formed. The confusion and diffusion processes
should be implemented by any cryptographic system according to Shannon's concept pro- posed [6, 7].
These processes match periodicity, a mixing property, and high sensitivity to the small variations in initial
conditions or control parameters in chaotic systems [8, 9]. Therefore, the chaos phenomenon may be
a prospective pseudo-random source, which is generally used in information security. Chaotic systems used
extensively in many branches of science.

1.1.3.6D hyper chaotic system

In this paper, we use a proposed novel 6D-Hyper Chaotic System. The novel six-dimensional
autonomous system is obtained as follows:

where xl, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6 andt * called the states of system and a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,ij, and k are positive

parameters of the system. The 6-Dimentional system (1) portrays a chaotic attractor upon chosing the values
of the system parameters as follows:

 

a=10.2, b=12, c=5.1, d=30, e=2.5, f=2, g=5 ,h=0.5, 1=10, j=17, and k=4.

We take the initial conditions as:
x1(0)=0.5 , x2(0)=2, x3(0)=1.5, x4(0)=6, x5(0)=0.4 and x6(0)=1.

According to the nonlinear dynamical theory, a quantitative measure approach of the sensitive
dependence on the initial conditions is to calculate the Lyapunov exponent (LE) which is the average
divergence or convergence rate of two nearby trajectories. Moreover, the 10 LEs of a nonlinear dynamical
system as in System (1) with parameters a=10.2,b=12,c=5.1,d=30, e=2.5, f=2,g=5 ,h=0.5 1=10 jJ=17,and k=4.
Results obtained as below:

L1= 4.72625, L2= 1.06765, L3= -1.26405,

L4= -4.89365, L5=-14.9575 L6= -21.0403

Observably, the largest LE is positive, showing chaotic nature of the system. Being that Z1 and L2 are
a positive Lyapunov exponent, it is expected that the remaining 3 LEs are negative. Thus, the system is hyper-
chaotic. The numerical simulation was performed using the MATHEMATICA program. This nonlinear system
presents both complex & abundant chaotic dynamic behaviors; Figure 1 and 2 presents the strange attractors in
3D while the 2D representation of the strange attractors are depicted in Figure 3 and 4. Both Figures 1 and 3
showed the shape of the topology looking like a flying butterfly with flipping wings.

2. WEB APPLICATION SECURITY

To ensure safe transaction and protected access to web-based sensitive resources, user
authentication is a basic requirement. Whenever a web application provides authentication, both login and
password details are sent to the user but in most instances, HTTP moves credentials from a client to a server.
Most times, the credentials may not be stored in plaintext form on servers by some existing solutions for
security reasons but sent to the servers during the authentication process in a readable form. Some other
solution can rely on using the HTTP Digest Mode 2, but the issue with this approach is the chances of
the server impersonating a third party with the request and this is a serious privacy-related issue. However,
this issue is usually ignored by most non-commercial web application developers. Asymmetric cryptography
communication protocols such as HTTPS are commonly used by developers for the development of
commercial software, such as on-line banking and shopping software. This protocol provides a secure
connection; hence, the credentials are still being sent. This problem is partly resolved with public key as
the users are meant to provide either key pairs or digital certificates, both public and private. However, users
are used to logging in and passwords that are easy to recall and convenient to use. Security of Web
applications defined as the methods, principles and implementation used to avoid and identify security
threats. Security can be understood as effective threat-free measure solution [10].

In a web application, the standard way to authenticate a user is to ask the user for a login and
password. The username and password will then be sent directly to the server see Figure. 5 and the server
will address the question. An HTTPS protocol used when protection is required. However, the passwords
sent over Internet and servers can read them, even though the password is stored in a hashed and salted form.
For instance, a user can often visit a website whose browser cannot verify the certificate. Typically,
the browser allows users to accept the certificate though its verification has been unsuccessful.

The open web application security project (OWASP) is a universal, non-profit association dedicated
to security of web applications. One of OWASP's center standards is that their entire materials are
uninhibitedly accessible and effectively open on their site, making it workable for anyone to improve security
for their own web apps [11-16].

Below are OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks [17-26]

Web application authentication using ZKP and novel 6D chaotic system (Shatha J. Mohammed)
1526 O ISSN: 2502-4752

1) Injection: This is encountered when unverified data is transmittd to a code interpreter in an input form or
through other ways of data submission to a web application. It is referred to as an SQL injection attack.

2) Broken Authentication: Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in authentication systems to gain access to
legitimate user accounts and could have a chance of compromising the whole system from such
compromised user account. For instance, an attacker may have access to a list that contains numerous
known combinations of username/password obtained during a data breach and try to use some of
the combinations on a login system in a bid to see if any one will work. To avoid authentication
vulnerabilities, some strategies, such as 2-factor authentication (2FA) and limiting the number of
repeated login attempts, are used.

3) Sensitive Data Exposure: Attackers can access that data and use it for harmful purposes. A common
way attacker steal sensitive information is by using man-in-the-middle attack.

4) XML External Entities (XEE): This attack targets XML input-parsing web applications.

5) Broken Access Control: This gives attackers the chance to bypass the authorization step in order to
perform tasks as if they are legitimate users.

6) Security Misconfiguration: This vulnerability is the commonest one in the list; it is encountered when
using default configurations or when displaying excessively verbose errors.

7)  Cross-Site Scripting: Attackers can be exploited this vulnerability to execute malicious JavaScript codes
on the browser of a victim. For instance, the attacker could send the victim an email that seems to be
coming from a trusted bank but with a web link to that website of the bank.

8) Insecure Deserialization: This attack mainly targets numerous web applications that perform data
serialization and de-serialization.

9) Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Components such as libraries and frameworks are used
by most of the modern web app developers.

10) Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Many web applications are not taking enough steps to detect data
breaches. OWASP recommends the implementation of loggingand monitoring by the web developers; they
should also implement incident response plans to ensure they can detect attacks targeted at their applications.

3. METHODOLOGY AND ANALYSIS

Advances and growth of web application have led to an increase in design and security complexity.
This paper proposes a novel authentication solution, which is a secure login and registration system, with
high usability and stealth features to keep servers and services secret and safe. The proposed solution is
stateless, requiring only the client to memorize a command, the IP of the server and the password chosen.
The solution is transmitted as a method to protect servers from attacks ranging from port scans to day zero
exploitation. Cryptographic hashes were created via chaotic systems, to function as a random for both client
and server. The main idea depends on generating random numbers. In this side, researcher suggest
a 6D-Hyper Chaotic System. Another contribution in this paper is achieve Authentication, this one of most
important Top 10 risks that explained in OWASP report, this problem named authentication broken which
solved using Zero-Knowledge Proof protocol with adaptation and modification suggested by researcher.

4. PROPOSED MODEL

Table 1 illustrate the general proposed model structure. There are two sides of the Client and Server
model being introduced, each of them conducting different processes and services to complete proposed
authentication method. A random number generator, based on the combination of proposed system.
The generator produces a sequence consisting of 32-bit blocks for three initial seeds given. The treatment
includes permutations and XOR operation on the lesser 32 bits of the elements obtained from chaotic system.

4.1. Initialization
A series of random numbers generated in a list format at this stage that can be used in any step
involving random numbers, using chaos theory, the outputs of which are often complex decimal numbers.

4.2. Registration

There is a user that enters the username and password when first registers. The registration process
shown in the proposal is split into two essential steps, the first stage being the initialization and the second
stage being the registration. At initialization, generator uses the chaotic method as shown in the Figures 1-4
which generates a group of highly randomized numbers, these numbers are stored in a chaotic list, which will
be used early in the registration step.

Indonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci ISSN: 2502-4752 OO 1527

Server will be selected from these random numbers (gO) as the general random number for each client,
this number will be known to both the client and the server. Stages of registration described in detail in Table 1.
Now, in the hashing algorithm, the password is the entry to this algorithm, which could have been any size and
length, output always fixed size, this password is padded to 512 bits after transforming it from ASCII code into
binary format. 512 bits for blocks broken down to 16 words each block consists of 32 bits, the result of the hash
algorithm is 128 bits, which is very secure since the original output data cannot be eversible. In this case,
there is a certainty that the Server will never store the password. This is done by using zero knowledge protocol.
It is a recent addition, which supports the power of the proposed research algorithm.

4.3. Authentication

Every user has an account created for him at the registration stage. In this plan, the login algorithm
has two stages, first initialization, where random keys are generated at this point using a chaotic system as
previously shown, and second authentication method to validate user identity, where authentication is
primarily at each user login to the website. In authentication, the (a) variable was selected by server for each
new session to make it impossible to detect in the authentication process from the intruder, and (a) item was
stored in a hidden buffer at the time of the session to encrypt in the next steps to prevent it from being
revealed to the public interest.Server encrypts (a) to produce (ae) using the client's public key and sends the
encrypted value to the client to be decrypted using the private key, in which case the client selects the random

number (m) from the Generated List by proposed chaotic system, and encrypts it using RSA with (d) as the
key to obtain (T1) and then uses the three values a, m and Y to generate the value (c) using the hash
algorithm. Finally, the server still has the three (Y, m, a) from which (c) is collected from the client to equate
it with (c), to test whether it is authenticated or not.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Proposed framework applied to Web application for e-learning. This e-learning web application has
been designed with ASP.Net and contains many services that teachers as well as students require.
The proposed system works to secure the most critical stage of a framework that should be more authentic
and secure for users to log in or register in the system. Then introduced a protocol, as described earlier in
Table 1. Researcher recommended that a ZKP protocol with RSA algorithm and digital signature principles
be used to protect the non-disclosure or use of passwords that are vulnerable to theft or speculation.
The process of producing random numbers was further complicated by the use of chaos theory, specifically
the proposed 6D Chaotic system algorithm. The results of the proposed research showed the effectiveness of
the approach used, as well as the achievement of the protective elements established using CIA, which is an
important basis for securing web-wide sites and applications.

We conducted a large-scale analysis of the password meter, finding the meter had an effect on user
behavior and safety. Meters have caused users to create more passwords. Nevertheless, unless the meter rated
passwords stringently, the resistance of the resulting passwords to password cracking attacks is minimal.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a physical sciences laboratory and a non-
regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. NIST applied to the proposed system.
Testing results as illustrated in Table 2.

6. CONCLUSION

The random numbers that are generated using chaotic are very safe. It gives the system, because
each number is unpredictable, a very high randomization that gives robustness. Thus, attackers and any users
cannot obtain the passwords of members by using the new authentication method where it was
the combination of Zero Knowledge method with proposed chaotic system and RSA algorithm. Many keys
used in the framework being proposed are complex and strong keys. The main reason for this is the proposed
chaotic system, a new addition to the process of generating random numbers that go into RSA algorithm
work. The proposed method for the key generation examined using NIST 15 testing. That demonstrated
a rather important convergence to the organization's verified ideal results.
