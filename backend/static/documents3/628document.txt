consider the efficiency of the proposed scheme, image normalization is performed.
The color information is used to identify camera-captured screen images. In the pre-
processing part, the effect of noise in captured screen images is reduced by a
bilateral filter. The color and spatial information is used to initially and roughly locate
the candidate region. To reduce the skew effect, a skew correction algorithm based
on the Hough transform is developed. A template matching algorithm is used to
find special symbols for locating the region of interest (ROI). For digit segmentation,
digits are segmented in the ROI based on the vertical projection and adaptive
thresholding. For the digit recognition, some features are measured from each digit
segment and a classifier based on the support vector machine is applied to
recognize digits.
The experiment’s results show that the proposed system could effectively not only
use color information to distinguish the captured screen images from the skin
images but also detect the ROls. After the digit segmentation, the accuracy rates of
digit recognition are 98.4% and 94.2% for the proposed system and the Tesseract
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, respectively. These results demonstrate
that the proposed system outperforms the Tesseract OCR software in terms of the
accuracy rate of digit recognition.

1 Introduction

Over the past few years, digital cameras have become almost ubiquitous and their
popularity for capturing the scenery is unchallenged. In fact, mobile devices with
camera have become an important image acquisition device in real applications of
image analysis and computer vision. For example, a mobile device with license rec-
ognition technology can make the police easily identify stolen cars. In hospitals,
physicians can use a device with the bar code reader to easily access patients’ med-
ical records. In fact, physicians can also use a vision-based device with digit recog-
nition technology to easily recognize the patient identification information (PII)
and then find the corresponding medical records. For instance, physicians often
capture patients’ skin images to record their current situations in dermatology. To
help physicians recognize the PI, the screen images with PII are also captured.
Figure 1 illustrates the camera-captured images in dermatology. The top and bot-
tom columns of Fig. 1 are the screen and skin images, respectively. During the
diagnosis period, physicians can recognize the PII from the screen image, the PII
can be used to find these skin images from medical information system (MIS), and
then physicians can understand the condition of patient’s skin from the corre-
sponding skin images. Moreover, the PII can effectively archive patients’ skin im-
ages into MIS for reducing physicians’ working load in dermatology. This means
that effectively recognizing PII from camera-captured images is a significant pro-
cedure of computer aided diagnosis in dermatology. To this end, it motivates us to
develop an efficient vision-based scheme to recognize PII from camera-captured
images.

So far, there are no vision-based systems for recognizing PII captured from
camera-captured images. A patient identification recognition system often has
two main parts: region of interest (ROI) detection and digit recognition. There
are many articles about ROI detection. In fact, the definition of ROI may change
in different applications [1, 2]. For instance, ROI may be the region containing

car license plates, personal information, or the suspects in video surveillance

applications. In MIS, a ROI can be a region including the PII or tumors. In [1],
the ROI containing tumors is located by removing the background part to raise
the efficiency of tumor detection. As shown in captured screen images of Fig. 1,
the PII is on the green region. This means that the region containing the PII
can be considered as ROI within captured screen images in dermatology. The
other one is digit recognition. Digit recognition can be exploited to recognize
postcode, license plate, street number, etc. Until now, there are some existing
methods for handwritten digit recognition [3-5]. An intuitive technique is tem-
plate matching [6]. Unfortunately, the template matching approach often fails
when the skew effect exists in unconstrained images. According to [3, 4], a
feature-based handwritten digit recognition method often has two parts: feature
extraction and digit classification. In [3], some feature extraction approaches
were described for handwritten character recognition. For example, some fea-
tures such as gradient histogram [3] or projection histograms [5] can be mea-
sured from an image for digit recognition. For digit classification, some
classification techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial
neural network can be used as a classifier. However, as shown in Fig. 1, the
digits are the printed style. Since printed digits often have regular shape, it is
easier to recognize printed digits compared with handwritten digits. Therefore, a
digit recognition algorithm based on machine learning technology can be de-
signed to recognize printed digits in the proposed system.

Because it is the main target to obtain the PII in camera-captured images for
MIS by detecting and analyzing ROIs, some effects should be considered for devis-
ing the proposed system. Due to image acquisition, captured images are often not
the same size and the skew effect often occurs. It is difficult to automatically
recognize PII from images captured under the uncontrolled environments. For ex-
ample, the visual quality of camera-captured images may be poor due to the fol-
lowing factors: motion blurring, skew effect, image resolution, noise, etc. As shown
in Fig. 1 a, the skew effect and noise exist. It is no doubt that these factors do in-
crease the difficulty of automatically recognizing the PII from the camera-captured
images. To automatically recognize the PII from the camera-captured images, the
skew effect and noise should be eliminated as much as possible. This means that
the pre-processing including the skew correction is necessary in the proposed
scheme.

To effectively detect and analyze ROIs to obtain the PII from the camera-
captured images, a system based on the content analysis and machine learning is
developed. Figure 2 illustrates the block diagram of the proposed scheme. As
shown in Fig. 2, the proposed scheme is composed of three parts: pre-
processing, candidate region detection, and digit recognition. The pre-processing

part is utilized to normalize the input image and then determine whether an in-

put image is a screen image. The candidate region detection part is a coarse-to-

fine approach to locate the ROI for further analysis. The digit recognition part
is used to segment and recognize each digit in the ROI. Each part is elaborated
in the following.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, the pre-processing
part is introduced; in section III, the candidate region detection is described; and in
section IV, the digit recognition is elaborated. Section V details the results of experi-
ments conducted to evaluate the system, and section VII contains some concluding

remarks.

2 Pre-processing

In real applications, physicians can capture screen images and skin images by using a
digital camera or smart phone in dermatology. To consider the efficiency of the pro-
posed system, the pre-processing part is comprised of denoising, image normalization,
and image classification. As well-known, a bilateral filter cannot only reduce the noise
effect but also preserve the edge information in natural and depth images [7, 8]. To re-
duce the noise effect, a bilateral filter [7, 8] is the first step of pre-processing in the pro-
posed system. The image normalization and image classification are described in the

following.
A. Image normalization

In the actual environments, the spatial resolutions of captured images are often
different due to different image acquisition devices. This means that different
mobile devices with different resolutions may be used in real applications. It is
often expected that the computational complexity of dealing with captured im-
ages with different spatial resolutions is high. To consider the efficiency of the
proposed system, the input image is decimated to obtain a normalized version.
The image normalization process is a down-sampling operation described as

follows:
x? = Ty (X), (1)

where 7;(-) denotes the down-sampling operation and X” is the normalized version.
The down-sampling operation is a low-pass filter and then the high-frequency compo-

nents are often attenuated in the decimated captured images [6].
B. Image classification

As shown in Fig. 1, there are more yellow, green, blue, and gray pixels in the screen
images. However, because the skin images may contain not only the skin but also the
patient’s clothes and the background of the scene shot, the variance of color informa-
tion is large in the captured skin images compared with the screen images. Therefore,
the properties of color information can be used to identify the screen images for image
classification.

The hue, saturation, value (HSV) color space corresponding to human perception
has been used in the image analysis and computer vision [6, 9]. Here, the proper-
ties of color information in the HSV color space are analyzed for image
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27

classification. The steps of distinguishing the screen images from the skin images

are described as follows:
1. Normalize the input image:

To raise the efficiency of the proposed system, the size of the input image is normal-
ized as 640 x 480 pixels.

2. Perform the color space transformation and count the numbers of yellow, green,

and blue pixels in the HSV color space:

Since a screen image contains some yellow, green, and blue pixels, the color informa-
tion can be exploited for determining whether an input is a screen image. The numbers
of yellow, green, and blue pixels based on the HSV color space are determined in the

following:
1 if
20< I" (x,y)  <50
MY (x,y) = 140< (x,y) <255, (2)
0 otherwise
1 if
60< I" (x,y)  <90
M° (x,y) = 150< = I(x, y) <255, (3)
0 otherwise
1 if
100< I"(x,y) <130
M3 (x,y) = 200< (x,y) <255, (4)
0 others

where I’, P,and [represent the hue, saturation, and value components, respectively;
N*, N®, and N?® indicate the numbers of yellow, green, and blue pixels, respectively. (x,
y) denotes the image coordinate. After the yellow, green, and blue pixels are deter-
mined based on Eqs. (2)—(4), N®, N°, and N® can be computed from M DD MS, and Me,

respectively.

3. Determine whether the input is a screen image if the following conditions are
satisfied: NY > T’, N° > T°, and N” > T®, where the thresholds are determined as
T* =0.01, T° = 0.33, and T® = 0.0003 based on our experiences.

After the image classification, the screen image can be identified and then analyzed

for detecting the candidate region.

3 Candidate region detection

To effectively detect the candidate region in a screen image, a coarse-to-fine ap-
proach is developed. In the coarse-to-fine candidate region detection procedure, it
contains three subparts: the initial ROI cropping, the skew correction, and the can-
didate region refinement. The initial ROI cropping locates the initial ROI region
based on the spatial information. In fact, the screen may not be parallel to the
image plane of the image acquisition device, so the camera-captured images often
have the geometrical distortion and noise. Therefore, the skew correction is neces-
sary for effectively detecting the candidate region. After the skew correction, a can-
didate region refinement algorithm is used to refine the candidate region for a
further analysis.

A. Initial ROI cropping

Since the ROI is often located at the top part of a camera-captured screen image,
the position of a candidate region is initialized on the top 1/3 region of the input
image. In addition, as observed in Fig. la, the ROI often contains the yellow color
information, so the yellow information can be extracted as a feature to roughly
localize an area as the initial candidate region. Furthermore, in order to find the
coordinates from the initial candidate region in the vertical axis, a horizontal pro-
jection operation is adopted. Thus, the procedure of undertaking the initial ROI
cropping is described as follows:

(A1) Initialize the position of a candidate region on the top 1/3 region of the input
image.

(A2) Select the yellow regions by using Eq. (2) and then perform horizontal projection
[6] to obtain H, where H, is the output of the horizontal projection.

(A3) Find the maximum value of H, and then estimate an adaptive threshold as follows:

Thd, = a, x max{H;}, (5)

where max{-} is the maximum operator and Thd, denotes the adaptive threshold.
The parameter a, is set as 0.25.

(A4) Binarize H, by using Tid, and then search for the top and button coordinates of
the threshold H; to obtain the initial candidate region J.

Then the initial candidate region J containing PII can be obtained.

B. Skew correction

There are many existing methods to conduct the skew angle detection for the
scanned document images [10-13]. These existing skew angle detection methods can
be categorized into several classes: the projection profile analysis, Hough transform, the
nearest neighbor clustering, the cross-correlation, etc. [14—16]. Unfortunately, since the
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27 Page 7 of 15

characteristics of the screen images are different from those of document images, these
existing methods [10-12] may not be suitable to estimate the skew angles of the cap-
tured screen images.

To reduce the impact of the skew effect on locating PI, a skew correction algorithm
is used here. According to the structure property of PII in the screen images, the infor-
mation of horizontal lines is useful for estimating the rotation angle. To let horizontal
lines be detected easily, the impact of vertical lines on skew correction is decreased.
The steps of the skew correction are listed below:

1. Binarize J by using the adaptive thresholding [17] to obtain the binary map B.
2. Examine the white points based on the following rules:

(a) B, Y (x,y) is white.
(b) B,Y (x, y-1), B, Y(x-1,y-1), and B, Y(x + 1,y + 1) are white.
(c) One of B,Y(x,y + 1), B,Y(x-1,y +1), and B, Y(«-1,y) is black.

If the rules (a), (b), and (c) are satisfied, B, Y(x,y) is kept white; otherwise, B, Y (x, y)

is set to be black.

3. Perform the Hough transform on B and then estimate the rotation angle @ of J.
4. Modify J based on the estimated angle 0.

After estimating the skew angle, the modified ROI J can be obtained by re-rotating /
with the angle (—6). It is expected that the skew effect can be reduced on J, and then J

can be used for the further analysis.
C. Candidate region refinement

Due to the different situations for the image acquisition, the sizes of digits may not
be the same among the captured screen images. However, if the background around
digits could be removed as much as possible, it is easily to normalize the size of digits.
Thus, the boundaries of ROI should be refined in the vertical and horizontal directions
to eliminate the redundant background for better performance of the digit recognition.

The candidate region refinement modifies the vertical boundaries of ROI. The proce-
dures similar to (A2) to (A5) are used to refine the top and button boundaries of the
ROI. After refining the top and button boundaries of the ROI, the following procedure
is to find the left and right boundaries of ROI.

To find the left and right boundaries of ROI, the candidate region refinement is de-
veloped based on the template matching. As shown in Fig. 1, the PII is bounded to the
two specific symbols, “[” and “].” Therefore, the two templates containing the specific
symbols can be used to find the left and right coordinates of ROI. The steps of refining
the left and right boundaries of ROI are described as follows:
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27

T1.Compute the ratio 6 of ROI and the right template 7R as follows:

Rt
B= pit? (6)

where R” and TR” denote the heights of ROI and the right template, respectively.
Here the right template is “].”

T2. Normalize the right template based on f.
T3. Compute the cross-correlation of ROI and the right template as follows:

Yow y (TR(%', 9) x 15 (u + x", V + y'))
\/ Yow y FRx, 9)” x Dox gly (u +x!,v+y')?

where TR is the right template and S(u,v) represents the cross-correlation result at

(u, Vv).

S(u,v) = (7)

T4. Find the maximum value of cross-correlation and its position. The position is set
as the coordinate of the right boundary of ROI.

T5. Repeat steps T1 to T4 to find the maximum value of cross-correlation and its pos-
ition by using the left template. Here, the left template TZ is “[.” The position is set
as the coordinate of the left boundary of ROL

T6. Refine the ROI based on the coordinate of the right and left boundaries.

4 Digit recognition

Due to the skew effect, the template matching is not suitable in the proposed system.
To recognize the PII from the ROI, there are two subparts: digit segmentation and digit
recognition. For a ROI, the digit segmentation is used to segment each possible digit
for the digit recognition. As mentioned in section I, recognizing each digit can be con-
sidered as a classification problem. This means that it is necessary to extract some use-
ful features and construct a suitable classifier for the digit recognition. Moreover, as
shown in Fig. 1, since the digits are the printed style, the proposed digit recognition al-
gorithm should be devised for dealing with the printed digits in the camera-captured
images. The two subparts will be introduced in detail in the following.

A. Digit segmentation
Before recognizing the digits in the ROI, digits need to be segmented from the ROI.
As shown in Fig. la, the color of PII is different from the background. Based on the ob-

servation, the steps of the digit segmentation for a ROI are described as follows:

1. Perform histogram equalization [5].
2. Conduct Otsu thresholding [6].

Page 8 of 15
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27 Page 9 of 15

3. Perform morphological opening operation [6].

4. Perform the vertical projection and measure an adaptive threshold Thd, as follows:

Thdy = a x max{P’ (B3)}, (8)

where B; denotes the binarization result after morphological opening operation and
P’ is the vertical projection operation. The parameter a is set as 0.10.

5. Detect the beginning and the end points of each digit based on the adaptive thresh-
old Thd,. The beginning and the end points of each digit can be expressed as below:

St; = min{ Vi(w) >Thd (9)

En; = max{V,(u) > Thd>}, (10)

where St; and En; represent the beginning and the end points of the i-th digit, re-

spectively, V, = P’(B;), and min{-} is the minimum operator.
B. Digit classification

Since each digit segment may not have the same size, each digit segment should be
normalized for the digit recognition. To recognize each detected digit segment, some
useful features should be measured, and a suitable classifier should be designed. Hence,
to classify each digit segment, there are two subparts: feature extraction and digit
classifier.

As known, the structure among the printed digits is clear and different from each
other. Figure 3 illustrates the feature extraction for recognizing each digit segment. For
each digit segment, the steps of feature extraction are described as follows:

 

 

(a) (b)

Fig. 3 Feature extraction for digit recognition: a four column regions and b eight row regions

 
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27 Page 10 of 15

1. Normalize the digit segment into 16 x 32 pixels.
2. Divide the normalized digit segment into four column regions shown in Fig. 3a and
compute features as follows:

4i-1 31
Fi= So SY (Oley), £=1,2,3,4, (11)
«=A4(i-1) y=0

where Q denotes digit segment and F; represents the features extracted from four
column regions.
3. Divide the normalized digit segment into eight row regions shown in Fig. 3b and

calculate features as follows:

15 4i-1
Fr= S- O(x,y), i=1,...,8, (12)
«=0 y=4(i-1)

where F? represents the features extracted from the eight row regions.

It is expected that the structure of each digit measured by F; and F; is different from
each other. Then F; and F can be used as features for the digit recognition.

In fact, due to the lighting condition, the complex background, and the image reso-
lution, the candidate regions may be noisy and then the noisy features often make the
digit recognition difficult. In the machine learning field, a supervised learning algo-
rithm, SVM, is popularly exploited in many applications such as character recognition,
text categorization, and face recognition [18]. The basic idea of SVM is to simultan-
eously minimize the empirical classification error and maximize the geometric margin
between different classes. To deal with the difficult classification problems, SVM maps
the features to higher dimensional space and then a hyperplane which potentially pro-
vides a better classification performance in the mapped feature space could be found.
Then one of SVM software, LibSVM [19], is used as a digit classifier here.

5 Experimental results

To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, 253 test images including 100
camera-captured screen images and 153 camera-captured skin images from dermatol-
ogy are collected for testing. The frame sizes of test images are 1256x1920, 3648x2736,
and 4000x3000 pixels. The radial basis function is chosen as the kernel function in the
SVM classifier for digit classification. In this section, the performance index used in the
evaluations is firstly described. Secondly, the proposed system is analyzed. Finally, the
proposed system’s performance is compared with that of the existing tool.

A. Performance index

To evaluate the proposed system in terms of its capability and preciseness, accuracy
is considered as the performance index [14—16, 20]. The accuracy rate is a traditional
criterion that is widely used to measure the performance in many applications such as
shot change detection and object detection. The accuracy rate is determined as follows:
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27 Page 11 of 15

Np + Nn

Accuracy = NpuNwhNpeN,,’ (13)
where No, Ny, and Nr are the numbers of correct detections, missed detections, and
false alarms, respectively; (Nc + Nj,) is the total number of true objects; and (Nc + Nr)
is the total number of detected objects. Nrp = Nc + Ny and Nyy denote the number of
truth positive and true negative, respectively. Theoretically, it is assumed that the
higher the accuracy can be, the better the detection rate of the proposed system can be
achieved.

B. Analysis of the proposed scheme

The proposed scheme is analyzed in the following. Figure 4 a illustrates three samples
of camera-captured screen images. Note that due to the privacy issue, the patients’
names are partially blurred. As observed in Fig. 4a, the PII digits among these captured
screen images are with different size and located in different relative position of the
captured images. The skew effect also exists. The different size, relative position, and
skew effect result from that the position and the view angle of the camera relative to
the screen are not fixed during image acquisition. The unconstrained image acquisition
conditions do raise the difficulty of locating and recognizing PII in the camera-
captured screen images. That is why the proposed scheme is developed.

B.1 Pre-processing

There are 253 test images including 100 screen images and 153 skin images for test-
ing. All of the screen images can be correctly identified. The experimental results show
that the proposed system based on the color information can effectively distinguish the
screen images from the skin images.

B.2 Initial ROI cropping

Figure 4 b illustrates the results of the initial ROI cropping. Compared with Fig. 4a,

the initial candidate regions shown in Fig. 4b can be effectively detected from the input

images. These experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively re-
move the background, the initial ROIs contain the PII and the search space can be ef-
fectively reduced for locating PII. In addition, although the initial ROIs can be roughly
detected, the skew effect still exists in the initial ROIs shown in Fig. 4b. That is why the
skew correction is needed in the proposed system.

B.3 Skew correction

Figure 4 c illustrates the results of the skew correction. As shown in Fig. 4c, the skew
effect is visually reduced compared with Fig. 4b. The experimental results show that
the proposed skew correction algorithm can estimate the rotation angles and then de-
crease the skew effect effectively.

To evaluate the performance of the skew correction in the proposed system, 20 im-
ages with the skew effect are simulated for testing. Compared with the ground truth,
the average, minimum, and maximum errors of the proposed skew correction algo-
rithm are 0.35°, 0.05°, and 1.09°, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed skew correction algorithm can effectively reduce the skew effect.

B.4 Candidate region refinement

Figure 4 d shows the result of the proposed candidate region refinement algo-
rithm. As we can see in Fig. 4d, the ROIs can be correctly relocated by using the
proposed candidate region refinement algorithm and only PII exists in the refined
ROIs. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed candidate region
refinement algorithm, the error rate is defined as the position difference of ROI
between the ground truth and the detected version. The ground truth is obtained
by manually locating the ROI in the captured screen images. For the test images,
the maximum and minimum values of ROIs are 203 and 95 pixels in width. The
maximum and minimum values of ROIs are 57 and 29 pixels in height. The aver-
age values of error rates are 1.03 and 1.02 pixels in the horizontal and vertical di-
rections after refining the candidate regions by using the proposed algorithm. The
experimental results show that the proposed candidate region refinement algorithm

can efficiently refine the boundaries of the ROIs.
C. Digit recognition

Here, the performance of digit recognition in the proposed system is analyzed.

C.1 Digit segmentation

Figure 4 e shows the results of digit segmentation. As shown in Fig. 4e, although the
width of each digit may not be the same, the proposed segmentation algorithm can find
the boundary of each digit efficiently. This means that the proposed digit segmentation
algorithm can locate each digit in ROIs effectively. In addition, to evaluate the perform-
ance of the proposed digit segment algorithm, the error rate is defined as the position
difference of digit segment between the ground truth and the detected version. The
ground truth is obtained by manually locating the ROI in screen images. For 167 digits,
the maximum value of errors for the start and end points of digit segments are 5 and 2
pixels, respectively. The average errors are 0.45 and 0.35 pixels for the start and end
points of digit segments, respectively. Therefore, the experimental results show that the
proposed system can locate these digits in ROIs effectively.

C.2 Digit classification
Lin et al. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (2020) 2020:27 Page 13 of 15

The Tesseract OCR software created by Google is a well-known tool to recognize
digits. Here, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the Tes-
seract OCR software. There are 60 samples of each digit for training and there are 674
digits in ROIs for testing. Table 1 shows some wrong results of digit recognition done
by the proposed scheme and the Tesseract OCR software. As observed in Table 1,
some digits may not be correctly recognized. For case 1 in Table 1, there are one and
two errors for the proposed system and the Tesseract OCR software, respectively. In
addition, there are 663 and 635 digits correctly recognized by the proposed system and
the Tesseract OCR software, respectively. The missing detection and false alarm are 6
and 5 in the proposed system, but the missing detection and false alarm are 27 and 12
in the Tesseract OCR software. This means that the accuracy rates are 98.4% and
94.2% for the proposed system and the Tesseract OCR software, respectively. Further-
more, the accuracy rates of each digit for the proposed system and the Tesseract OCR
software are listed in Table 2. The accuracy rates are at least 90.9% for the proposed
scheme. As shown in Table 2, the accuracy rates of the digits “8” and “3” are lower than
those of the others in both methods. The main reason is that “8” and “3” have little
similar shapes in these camera-captured screen images. These experimental results
show that the proposed scheme can provide a better performance of digit recognition
for camera-captured screen images than the Tesseract OCR software.

6 Discussion

In fact, physicians can use a vision-based device with digit recognition technology to
easily recognize the patient identification information (PII) and then find the corre-
sponding medical records. Moreover, the PII can effectively archive patients’ skin im-
ages into MIS for reducing physicians’ working load in dermatology. This means that
effectively recognizing PII from camera-captured images is a significant procedure of
computer-aided diagnosis in dermatology. To this end, this study aims at developing an
efficient vision-based scheme to recognize PII from camera-captured images.

Until now, there are no vision-based systems for recognizing PII captured from
camera-captured images. In this paper, a vision-based patient identification recognition
system based on image content analysis and support vector machine is proposed for
medical information system. The experimental results show that all of the screen im-
ages can be correctly identified. Figure 4 illustrates some experimental results of pre-
processing, initial ROI cropping, skew correction, candidate region refinement, and

digit segmentation. These results show that the subparts of the proposed scheme can
function well. As for digit recognition, the accuracy rates of digit recognition are 98.4%
and 94.2% for the proposed system and the Tesseract OCR software, respectively. The
experimental results demonstrate that these extracted features are useful for the digit
recognition, and the proposed system is superior to the Tesseract OCR software in

terms of the accuracy rate for the digit recognition.

7 Concluding remarks

In this paper, a vision-based patient identification recognition system based on image
content analysis and support vector machine is proposed for medical information sys-
tem, especially in dermatology. The proposed system is composed of three parts: pre-
processing, candidate region detection, and digit recognition. To consider the effi-
ciency, the image normalization is performed. The color information is used to identify
the camera-captured screen images. In the pre-processing section, a bilateral filter is
used to reduce the effect of noise in the captured screen images. The color as well as
spatial information is used to initially and roughly locate the candidate region. To re-
duce the skew effect, a skew correction algorithm based on the Hough transform is de-
veloped. A template matching algorithm is used to find the special symbols for locating
the region of interest (ROI). For the digit segmentation, digits are segmented in the
ROI based on the vertical projection and adaptive thresholding. For the digit recogni-
tion, some features are measured for each digit segment and a classifier based on the
support vector machine is applied to recognize digits.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a number of images are col-
lected for testing. The experiment results show that the proposed system can effectively
not only use the color information to distinguish the captured screen images from the
skin images but also detect the ROIs. As for the skew correction, the experimental re-
sults show that the proposed skew correction algorithm can effectively decrease the im-
pact of the skew effect on the digit recognition. After the digit segmentation, the
average errors are 0.45 and 0.35 pixels for the start and end points of the digit seg-
ments, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy rates of digit recognition are 98.4% and
94.2% for the proposed system and the Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
software, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that these features are
useful for the digit recognition. In particular, the proposed system outperforms the
Tesseract OCR software in terms of the accuracy rate for the digit recognition.
