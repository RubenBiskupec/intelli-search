1. Introduction

Since the beginning of human history, and particularly in the last two
centuries, we have facilitated our life by designing tools, improving
them and accelerating their production. This innate characteristic led us
to shape our environment and develop our societies. However, it is now
imperative to face the challenges arising from two centuries powered by
oil-based resources, for which a transition to massive use of sustainable
energies have to be urgently addressed. To answer to these concerns, the
demand on energy storage technologies research compels the scientific
community to develop new tools capable of accelerating R&D. The last
thirty years have shown that Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most suited
technology to move from an oil-based to an electrical-based society
[1-5]. However, their performance, durability, recyclability and CO2
footprint require further improvement to make this transition feasible.
This can be achieved thanks to materials design [6-8] innovative
manufacturing [9-11] and manufacturing optimization [12-15], or
most likely, thanks to a combination of all of them. Regarding the latter,
both experimental and modelling approaches can be used to carry out its
optimization [16-25]. Particularly, the experimental approach is the
one that has mainly driven LIBs improvements, by unravelling links
between the manufacturing parameters and the electrochemical per-
formance, upon others [16-18]. However, it relies on a trial-and-error
approach, which is highly inefficient in terms of time, cost and
resources.

The manufacturing optimization is a complex multi-variable prob-
lem for which different scales are involved, namely interfaces at the
nanoscale, particles at the microscale, particle aggregates at the meso-
scale and cell components at the macroscale. To tackle such a complex
scenario, a complete understanding of the role of all the parameters
involved on all these scales is needed. As recently pointed out by Rynne
et al., design of experiments (DoE) can be used to minimize the number
of experiments to perform and to derive mathematical models
describing the relationships between the parameters analysed and the
observable(s) of interest, through statistical analysis [21,22]. However,
these empirical mathematical models were limited to linear or quadratic
relationships, which could be not enough to capture the expected
complex relationships between manufacturing parameters and electrode
properties at the different scales. Moreover, some of these properties (as
the active material (AM) surface in contact with the electrolyte) are
extremely difficult to measure routinely at the experimental level. An
experimentally validated mesoscale (tens of tm) physical model can
easily give access to these properties, allowing a deeper understanding
of the system under analysis. The importance of physicochemical 3D
mesoscale models then starts to be recognized [23-32]. Nonetheless,
with the currently available hardware technology, they can still be
computationally too expensive for their systematic use in experimental
data analysis.

The described scenario calls for faster approaches combining ex-
periments and models. The blooming Artificial Intelligence (AI) field
promises to accelerate the manufacturing optimization by revealing
patterns hardly recognizable by “classical” analysis methods [14,
33-38]. As they do not rely on physical models, the feasibility of this
approach depends on the capability to generate high quality datasets
(from experiments, physical models or both of them simultaneously)
complete enough to describe the battery manufacturing, which most
likely represents the limiting step to develop AI models. Takagishi et al.
recently reported a machine learning (ML) approach in which the
datasets were built by randomly generating in silico electrode meso-
structures (composed of only AM particles) coupled with a
zero-dimensional electrochemical model to _ calculate’ the

charge/discharge specific resistance [39]. Even if the above-mentioned
approach allows to build rapidly a large dataset (2000 electrode meso-
structures), its main drawbacks are the complete lack of link between
the generated electrode mesostructures and the experimental
manufacturing conditions, as well as the concerns about the reliability of
the randomly generated electrode mesostructures. Furthermore, the
approach reported by these authors does not consider the carbon-binder
domain (CBD), whose heterogeneous distribution throughout the elec-
trode was demonstrated to have a major importance in the performance
of LIBs [28,29,40].

ML algorithms combined with experimental data were recently
proved by us to be suitable for discovering and assessing the in-
terdependencies between manufacturing parameters and electrode
properties for the case of electrode slurry features and coating condi-
tions [33]. An ideal strategy for a systematic use of ML-based approaches
should combine the intrinsic reliability of experiments and
physics-based modelling with the high throughput of stochastically
generated electrodes. This work aims to introduce a novel methodology
(Fig. 1), hereafter called hybrid methodology, encompassing experiments
and/or physics-based modelling together with data-driven electrode
mesostructures generation and ML algorithms to speed up the assess-
ment of the impact of manufacturing parameters on the final electrode
properties, with either well-known or novel LIBs chemistries. Such
assessment can then be used as a guide for manufacturing process design
and optimization. The hybrid methodology relies on results coming from
experiments and/or physics-based modelling to investigate the effects of
manufacturing variables on electrodes properties (Fig. 1A). The found
trends can be expressed through equations arising from mathematical
fitting or ML models, which are then embedded into a data-driven
electrode mesostructure generator (Fig. 1B). The latter means that
some features of the electrode mesostructure, as the evolution of the
electrode thickness/porosity along calendering or the particles reorga-
nization along solvent evaporation, can be controlled through the
experimental or computational inputs, while the remaining meso-
structure features are defined by a stochastic algorithm. The
so-generated electrode mesostructures can then be analysed in terms of
several electrode properties critically impacting electrochemical per-
formance, such as the particles interconnectivity or the electrolyte
effective conductivity (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the low computational cost
of the data-driven electrode mesostructure generator allows investi-
gating broad arrays of conditions and electrode properties, offering a
broader view on the manufacturing process under analysis. These data
can then be processed through ML algorithms in order to find mathe-
matical correlations between manufacturing conditions (electrode and
process variables) and electrode properties, which can then be used to
develop human interpretable graphs mapping these correlations
through regression or classification (Fig. 1D).

While the effect of manufacturing on macroscopic electrode prop-
erties (as its porosity, thickness and mass loading) can be easily captured
experimentally, the evolution of mesoscale properties can be studied
through experimentally validated physics-based modelling. As exten-
sively demonstrated by us in previous publications, 3D physics-based
models offer critical mesoscale information, as the evolution of the
percentage of AM surface in contact with the electrolyte or the spatial
particles organization through radial distribution function analysis
[27-31]. In addition, the same approach presented here could be
developed by using tomography (XTM) images as input for the analysis.
XTM (or even FIB-SEM) are high-resolution imaging techniques with
whom a full 3D mesostructure imprint of the electrode can be taken. At
the current technique’s state of the art, its main limitations are its high
costs and_ specific equipment (which hampers its routine
M. Duquesnoy et al.

implementation) and the difficulties in separating the 3 characteristics
electrode phases (AM, CBD and pores) [41-43]. Nonetheless, a recent
work by Gayon-Lombardo et al. [44], reporting a ML algorithm trained
with tomography images and capable of reconstructing reliable elec-
trode mesostructures, constitutes a possible approach for embedding
tomography-like structures in our overall methodology presented above.

In this work, we present a first case study of the calendering process
analysed through our hybrid methodology encompassing experimental
data, data-driven stochastic electrode mesostructures generation and
ML. Particularly, this methodology was tested and validated for the case
of LiNi,/3Mn,/3C01/302-based cathodes by analysing the effect of
calendering pressure, initial electrode porosity and composition on
electrode properties such as the solid and liquid phases tortuosities (1),
electrolyte effective conductivity, percentage of current collector (CC)
covered by AM or CBD phases and percentage of AM surface in contact
with the electrolyte. The wide array of the considered macro/mesoscale
electrode properties enabled to analyse simultaneously the impact of the
calendering process on all of them and paved the way into a rational and
fast way to optimize the calendering output properties in terms of the
process variables and the electrode initial properties.

2. Computational and experimental methods
2.1. Computational methodology

The workflow used along this work constitutes a part of the overall
methodology presented above (cf. Fig. 1), and it is schematized in Fig. 2
for the specific case of the electrode calendering. First, experimental
results are used to determine the relationship between the porosity after
the calendering (€,q) in terms of the electrodes properties prior the
calendering (its composition, porosity (€imj) and thickness) and the
process parameter (calender pressure). An experimental dataset of 54
electrodes encompassing 14 different initial/calendering conditions was
constructed. The initial conditions were measured by averaging the re-
sults obtained by analysing 29 different not calendered electrodes, as
reported in Section S1a. Afterwards, a polynomial fitting of these results
is performed to mathematically link €,,; to the electrode properties and

the process parameter analysed (Fig. 2A). The accuracy of the fitted
model is of ~97%, as discussed in more detail in Section S1 in the
Supporting Information.

The equation found through the above-mentioned polynomial fitting
was implemented in an in house data-driven stochastic electrode meso-
structure generator based on Matlab® programming language (Fig. 2B).
First, starting from a fixed initial simulation box (x x y x z, 50 x 50 x
100 pm°), and as a function of the electrode and process variables
chosen, the electrode porosity and thickness (z dimension) after the
calendering are calculated through the polynomial fit. Then, this in-
formation is used by the data-driven stochastic electrode mesostructure
generator to build a new simulation box by keeping fix the x and y di-
mensions. Afterwards, the new simulation box is filled stochastically
with AM and CBD phases based on the electrode composition and the
experimental AM particle size distribution, as it can be seen in the
representative electrode mesostructures for different AM compositions
shown in Figure S5, in the Supporting Information. This procedure al-
lows to rapidly build larger datasets respect the experimental one. More
details on the electrodes generation based on the stochastic procedure
can be found in Section S3, in the Supporting Information.

The generated electrode mesostructures are then analysed in terms of
their liquid-phase and solid-phase t (through TauFactor [45]), per-
centage of current collector (CC) surface covered by AM or CBD phase
(Y%cc-am Or %cc-cpp, respectively) and percentage of AM surface covered
by the electrolyte, referred thereafter as active surface (Fig. 2C). Herein,
all the void space in the electrode mesostructure is considered to be
filled with electrolyte [46]. Due to the partially stochastic nature of the
generated electrode mesostructures, this procedure is repeated ten times
for each calendering condition and the average values constitute the
dataset used by the ML algorithm (4400 structures, hence 440 data
points). The aim of the latter is to build electrode and process
variables-electrode properties interdependencies “maps”, in order to
ease their identification and understanding. For the development of ML
model (Fig. 2D and E) the Sure Independent Screening and Sparsifying
Operator (SISSO) [47] was chosen, using training and test sets consti-
tuted of randomly selected 80% and 20% of the dataset, respectively.

on identifying descriptors defined as non-linear combinations of the
original model inputs upon billions of possibilities, where the chosen
ones minimize the model error. This data-driven approach relies on
training procedures onto the dataset to identify these descriptors, which
ranks it as a ML algorithm. SISSO has two main advantages when
compared with other ML methods: (i) it outputs a mathematical equa-
tion describing the relations between input(s) and output(s), and (ii) it
gives reliable results even with relatively small training datasets. (i)
allows to analyse the physical meaning of the model developed and to
generalize it to other similar case studies, while (ii) reduces the time and
cost needed to build the dataset. Further details of the implementation of
the SISSO algorithm, including all the equations obtained, are reported
in Section S4 in the Supporting Information. The predictive accuracy of
the SISSO models was assessed by using its test set through regression
plots (true values vs. predicted values) for all the electrode properties
examined, as reported in Section S5 together with the training and test
sets selection procedure. These plots allow to compare the predictions
obtained by the ML model with the values coming from the test dataset.
Moreover, a second dataset composed of 440 data points (not considered
in both training and test sets) was used to further assess the accuracy of
the developed SISSO model. The prediction accuracy of the latter was
always higher than 97%, except for %cc.am, whose prediction accuracy
is of ~76%, which is understandable considering the dimension of AM
particles (~3-10 pm) and the relatively small surface area of the CC (50
x 50 pm2). Therefore, even slight changes in the number of AM particles
in contact with the CC leads to high standard deviations of the %cc.am
average values, affecting the model accuracy.

The €inix analysed values ranged between 40% and 50%, the AM
amount between 93% and 96% and the calendar pressure was varied
between 20 and 170 MPa. The training + test datasets consisted in 440
data points, including all the electrode properties for different calen-
dering conditions (fully reported as text file in the Supporting Infor-
mation), while the second dataset used to further test the SISSO model
contained other 440 data points not considered in both training and test
sets. Each data point comes from the average properties of 10 generated
electrode mesostructures. Consequently, 8800 electrode mesostructures
were generated to build these datasets. Regarding the computational
cost of the proposed procedure, the generation of the electrodes meso-
structures and the analysis of their properties took approximately 7 days
by using an Intel® Core™ i7-8700 CPU @ 3.2 GHz with 32 GB of RAM.
Training the SISSO models took approximately 24 h by using 9 pro-
cessors Intel® Xeon® CPU E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40 GHz, 128 GB of RAM.

2.2. Experimental methods

LiNi,/3Mn 1/3C01/302 (NMC) was supplied by Umicore. C-NERGY™
super C65 carbon black (CB) was supplied by IMERYS. Solef™ Poly-
vinylidene fluoride (PVdF) was purchased from Solvay and N-methy]l-
pyrrolidone (NMP) from BASF. The mass ratio between CB and binder
was maintained equal to one. The slurry solid components NMC, CB and
PVdF were premixed with a soft blender overnight. Afterwards, NMP
was added until reaching the desired ratio between the solid compo-
nents and the solvent (check Supporting Information, section Sla for
further details). The mixing was performed in a Dispermat CV3-PLUS

high-shear mixer for 2 h in a water-bath cooled recipient at 25 °C. The
slurry was coated over a 22 pm thick Aluminium CC using a comma-
coater prototype-grade machine (PDL250, People & Technology,
Korea), fixing the gap at 300 pm and the coating speed at 0.3 m/s. The
electrodes were dried in a built-in two-parts oven (1 m long each) at 80
and 95 °C and calendered with a prototype-grade lap press calendar
(BPN250, People & Technology, Korea). The latter consists in a two-roll
compactor of 25 cm of diameter in which the gap between the rolls
controls the pressure applied to the electrodes. Furthermore, both the
roll speed and the roll temperature can be controlled. The calendering
was performed at various applied pressures and at constant line speed
(0.54 m/min) and roll temperature (60 °C).

3. Results and discussions

Our hybrid methodology was used to analyse the effect of the applied
calender pressure (P) on the following electrode properties: (i) tortuosity
(t) and electrolyte effective conductivity (Ge¢¢), (ii) percentage of current
collector covered by AM or CBD particles, and (iii) active surface.
Hereafter, the t values correspond to the square root of the tortuosity
factor [48], while the standard deviations (SD) refer to the error asso-
ciated to the average property values associated to each condition
studied through the electrode generator algorithm. All the results are
analysed in terms of the electrode porosity before the calendering (éjnit)
and the electrode composition.

Fig. 3 shows the €,q obtained through the experimental polynomial
fitting in terms of the calendar pressure applied for different é€j,;, and AM
compositions. At a given calendering pressure, by increasing the AM
amount, higher values of €,q; are attained. The CBD are located around
AM particles, partially occupying the interstitial spaces of the AM
network. As they are smaller respect to the AM particles, upon defor-
mation due to calendering, they occupy a higher fraction of the inter-
stitial region, generating a more compact electrode and leading to lower
porosities for higher CBD amount [49]. On the other side, higher éjni:
values output lower porosities after calendering. A plausible explanation
for this observation can be that more porous un-calendered electrode
have higher degrees of freedom, which allows an easier reorganization
of its structure upon an applied pressure leading to a more compact and
interconnected solid phase network. This is of major importance for the
electrode manufacturing process, as during the coating and drying
stages the process parameters should be controlled to reach an optimal

porosity. As we showed in our previous work [33], this can be modu-
lated not only by the slurry AM/CB/binder relative composition but also
with the amount of solvent used during the slurry preparation. In gen-
eral, a sufficient amount of the latter is needed for a proper dispersion of
the solid particles, dissolution of the polymer and processability of the
slurry during the coating stage.

Fig. 4 reports the ML-predicted solid tortuosity (t,,)) as a function of
the pressure applied during the calendering for different ¢ini and AM
mass fractions. Ts, is defined as the tortuosity associated to a generic
particle moving through the solid particles network, without discrimi-
nation between AM and CBD phases. Consequently, it quantifies the
interconnectivity of the solid particles network. 1.1 decreases by
increasing the applied pressure, while the curves shift to higher values
when the AM mass fraction grows. The effect of the former can be un-
derstood by considering that when applying a pressure, the volume
fraction of the solid phase and the contacts between particles increase,
generating a bigger and more interconnected network that decreases
Tso]. On the other hand, as previously observed in Fig. 3, incrementing
the AM amount generates a less compact structure (higher ¢€,,;), leading
to higher values of t;,.}. Furthermore, by comparing Fig. 4 A, B, C and D
the effect of €initOM Tso] can be analysed as well. Notably, lower T,9) are
reached at the lower é,qregion, ie. when increasing éinj¢. As it was shown
in Fig. 3, higher ej, output lower ¢€,g,, meaning more linear paths within
the solid phase and less amount of constrictions and bottlenecks, making
Tso to decrease.

Fig. 5 A-D depicts the ML-predicted liquid tortuosity (tjq), ie. the
square root of the porosity times the ratio between the bulk and the
effective diffusivity of Lit, in terms of the pressure applied during the
calendering for different éinj, and AM mass fractions. It can be seen that
Tliq increases by incrementing the calender pressure. The latter is ex-
pected, as by increasing the applied pressure, €,q; lowers, which reduces
the size and interconnectivity of the pores. Moreover, the effect of
pressure on Tjjq is more pronounced for lower amounts of AM and,
consequently, higher amounts of CBD. Again, as the size of the CBD
phase is smaller, upon reducing the porosity, it occupies the interstitial
space between the bigger AM particles. This produces a drastic reduction
in the size of AM interstitial pores when CBD mass fraction is higher,
therefore outputting more tortuous paths within the pore phase. More-
over, it can be noticed that by increasing €ini the effect of the pressure on
Tliq is even more accentuated, which leads to significantly higher values
of Tjq at high calendering pressures. The latter is of particular relevance

because it clearly indicates how the initial condition of the calendering
process can have a strong impact on the electrode properties arising
from the manufacturing process itself. It should be also mentioned that
the calculation of tig performed with TauFactor does not take into ac-
count the microporosity of the CBD phase, which is expected to affect
the results herein reported. Indeed, this would imply a higher volume
fraction of smaller pores, leading to an even more marked increase of Tig
for high-CBD-content electrodes (yellow curves in Fig. 5A—D). Note that
high SD for tjg are found for the more calendered electrodes (lower
values of €¢a1), specially for the case of €init = 48%. As the SD comes from
the average Tjiq of the mesostructures obtained by the stochastic elec-
trode generator, this implies that the lower the porosity of the electrode
the higher the variation in the dispersion of tig values. This is due to the
fact that the tortuosity does not only depend in the geometric path
length but also on the size and shape of the particles in the electrode
mesostructure and the variation of the pore section area [50,51]. In
other words, it is not just the value of €.,) that impacts tortuosity but also
the pore size distribution (PSD). At lower €,,), the pore volume fraction is
lower and therefore the tj, is more sensitive to small variations in the
interconnectivity and shape of the pores. The above calls for better
metrics for quantifying the effect of €ca] on Tiq and points out the rele-
vance of routinely measure the PSD of battery electrodes.

Tliq is also expected to affect the electrolyte effective ionic conduc-
tivity, which is a critical electrode property that impacts the LIB cell
performance at high current densities/C-rates [52]. The relationship
between these two features is captured by the MacMullin number (Ny)
[53], which links the bulk and effective conductivity (op, and oe,

respectively) to the porosity and tortuosity factor (t), as reported in Eq

(1)

Taking into account that tijq and &,q; were calculated for all the
calendering conditions/electrode initial properties here analysed, the
Oeg can be derived by using a reference op,%. In this case, the op, used
(1.119 S/m) comes from a commercial LP30 electrolyte, at 25 °C [54].
Furthermore, the analysis in terms of o,g allows to capture simulta-
neously the effect of both tyjg and €cai.

Fig. 5 E-H shows the so calculated og as a function of €q) for

different ¢ini, and AM mass fractions. For completeness, ogg plotted in
terms of the applied calendar pressure is presented in Figure S8, in the
Supporting Information. Naturally, og decreases by reducing the elec-
trode porosity while, at constant €,q,, the higher the CBD content the
lower oe. This proves that not only the porosity value plays a key role in
the electrolyte conductivity, but also the pore size distribution: smaller
pores will cause a steeper reduction in og. By comparing the four
panels, it can be seen that upon increasing éini, lower ceg values are
attained, as a consequence of the reduction in the minimal é€,g; that can
be reached during the calendering process. In this sense, the in-
terdependencies between the previous manufacturing stages and the
output of the calendering process are once again stressed, meaning that
to control the impact of the latter on the electrolyte effective properties
one should optimize the AM/CB/binder/solvent proportions and their
impact on the electrode porosity after the drying step. Furthermore, as it
has been acknowledged [32,55], there is a trade-off between ogg and the
electrode electronic conductivity (somehow related to Tso), Fig. 4): they
should be both maximized upon calendering. As by increasing the
applied calender pressure the former gets reduced, the optimal é,qi
comes from a complex interplay between these two electrode properties.

One of the biggest advantages of our simulation approach is the
ability to quantify mesoscale features completely inaccessible form the
experimental point of view. One of them is the contacts between the
solid phase and the CC, which is closely related to the adhesion strength
and contact resistance of the electrode and it is modulated by the
calendering process [56,57]. Fig. 6 shows the ML-predicted %cc.cpp, ie.
the percentage of current collector surface covered by the CBD phase,
based on the pressure applied during the calendering for different éjni:
and AM mass fractions. In the same way, Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information displays %cc.am. Remarkably, %cc-cgp is only slightly
influenced by €ini, indicating that the increase in the electrode
compactness arising from high €éjnj, does not significantly affect the CC
coverage by the CBD phase. Moreover, increasing the calendering
pressure leads to an increment of %cc.cgp for low pressure values, while
for higher pressures it approaches to an asymptotic value, being the
latter slightly higher for higher ein. As expected, the increment in the
CBD amount results in an increase of %cc.cpp.

Another important mesoscale electrode property is the area of the
AM phase in contact with the electrolyte (AS), as this feature determines

the effective Lit reaction rate in kinetic limited conditions (i.e. high
current density operation conditions) [28,32]. In this sense, Fig. 7 dis-
plays the ML-predicted AS based on the pressure applied during the
calendering, for different éinj, and AM mass fractions. As expected, by
incrementing the AM amount, AS increases. Moreover, high values of
€init leads to a decrease of AS, especially at high pressure, due to the
lower attainable €,,;. Although we previously showed that higher éinj are
beneficial for attaining lower porosities (which would increase the
volumetric energy/power density of the battery), this is detrimental in
terms of AS, highlighting again that the optimal calendering process
condition must result from a compromise between several electrode
properties.

Fig. 8 summarizes the global trends found in this work by means of
our ML-supported approach, where the circles colour (green/red) in-
dicates if there is a direct or an inverse relationship between the vari-
ables, respectively. Furthermore, their size indicates the degree of
correlation, meaning that bigger circles represent strongly correlated
variables, while smaller ones indicate that the output property is not
significantly affected upon changing such initial condition. The circles
sizes were calculated from the variable’s pair Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient. The correlation matrix can be found in section

S7, in the Supporting Information. These interdependencies clearly
reveal that the manufacturing optimization relies on a complex interplay
of trade-offs. For example, the tortuosities of the liquid and solid phases
have opposite relations with the initial electrode properties/process
parameter, while both of them have to be minimized to improve the
electrochemical performance. Similar remarks can be concluded for the
AS and %cc-cpp- In this case, both of them should be maximized while
their correlations with the initial electrode properties/process param-
eter are opposites. A more quantitative way to analyse these correlations
is through the plan built by the first two principal components obtained
through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as the one presented in
Figure S10, in the Supporting Information.

Fig. 8 also highlights the potential of tracking at a glance as many
aspects as possible of the mesostructure evolution upon a manufacturing
process such as the calendering, clearly indicating that it is not possible
to find a general recipe to optimize LIB performance. The calendering
pressure (and most likely all the electrode and process variables) should
be tuned as a function of the electrode target performance. In this sense,
the mathematical functions found along this work and reported in the
Supporting Information could help manufacturers to identify the range
of calender pressures, electrodes porosities prior the calendering and

composition most suited for the application of interest, which is ex-
pected to assist the experimental manufacturing optimization.

The versatility of this methodology also ensures that by adding either
more analysed properties or more physical details to the model, the
results will be even more representative. Indeed, the changes in the
volume fraction of the constituting phases were taken here as a metric to
evaluate the effect of the applied calender pressure. Nonetheless, it is
known that the electrode compression does not only impact the former
but also causes particle deformation (or even breakage of the bigger AM
particles) [58,59], without overlooking the fact that mesostructural
changes are expected to depend on how the CBD phase is distributed
throughout the electrode (tuned by the mixing and drying stages
[60-62]). Further research to implement results coming from

physics-based modelling, together with the experimental data, into the
electrode mesostructure generator algorithm are ongoing and will be the
core of further reports by our group. The latter will allow investigating
manufacturing processes which are expected to influence mainly the
particles reorganization along the electrode mesostructures, as for the
case of solvent evaporation [61]. The chemical nature of the electrode
components used and the AM or CBD particle size distribution can be
other dimensions to further explore through this methodology.

parameters on the electrodes properties for the development of a data-
driven electrode mesostructures generator and ML algorithms to study
the manufacturing parameters-electrode properties interdependencies.
Relative to the state of the art, this methodology lead to a faster, but still
reliable, way to analyse these interdependencies. Particularly, it was
successfully applied to the case of NMC-based cathodes calendering
combining experimental results, in silico electrodes mesostructures and a
ML algorithm based on the SISSO method. Our workflow allowed
tracking the effect of the calender pressure, electrode composition and
initial porosity on a wide array of mesoscale electrode properties criti-
cally influencing LIBs electrochemical performance. Specifically, the
particle network interconnectivity, the electrolyte tortuosity and effec-
tive conductivity, the coverage of the current collector by CBD/AM
particles and the active surface area were analysed and discussed in
detail. The results obtained herein proved the validity and the potential
of the proposed approach, clearly assessing the complex in-
terdependencies between manufacturing processes and electrode prop-
erties, paving the way to a more rational understanding. The
methodology here developed can then be implemented and further
improved to analyse different manufacturing processes, as slurry mixing
or solvent evaporation, and even more electrode mesoscale properties
than the ones considered in this work. In this sense, our workflow opens
the door to new methodologies combining different scales of analysis
(macro, meso or micro) for tracking the effects of manufacturing on
other electrode properties impacting its electrochemical performance,
cycle life or safety, facilitating LIBs optimization in order to boost the
energy transition our society and environment demand.
