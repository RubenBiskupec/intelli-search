Introduction

Blended learning is an umbrella term used to define the broad teaching approaches
that integrate the effectiveness of both the face-to-face (f2f) classroom and the
technology-enhanced learning environments (Hrastinski, 2019; Yilmaz & Malone,
2020). Blended learning utilizes a wide range of information and communication tech-
nology tools such as the learning management system (LMS), knowledge building ap-
plications like blogs, Wikis, forum, concept mapping tools, online authoring tools,
open educational resources (OERs) (Garrison & Vaughan, 2008), etc. Integration of

technologies in blended learning provides timely and constructive feedback, thereby,
transforming the instructor-centric education into a student-centric one (Bernard,
Borokhovski, Schmid, Tamim, & Abrami, 2014). With the increasing affordability of elec-
tronic gadgets and familiarity in different digital learning environments, students are now able
to realize the benefits of Blended Learning (Buket & Meryem, 2008; Glazer, 2011).

Though blended learning promotes a self-paced and flexible learning environment, it
mostly depends on the individual’s self-motivation to take responsibility for their own
learning (Chew & Wee, 2015). Research on flipped classroom strategy, a model of
implementing blended learning, has provided pieces of evidence that students often ex-
hibit poor engagement, lack of self-regulation and time management skills, and thereby
limit the possibility of reaping the benefits of the learning strategies (Rasheed et al.
2020; Halverson, 2016). This is particularly important while adopting similar strategies
in foundational courses like Physics. Physics is generally perceived as one of the most
problematic subjects among all other science disciplines for high school students and
becomes even more evasive when they enter into tertiary level education (Erhan, 2016).
Though blended learning strategy has proven to be effective to support the student
learning, augmenting a flipped classroom within the f2f physics courses has remained a
challenge (Hamdan, McKnight, McKnight, & Arfstrom, 2013). The context of this study
is a Physics undergraduate course where we explore the use of flipped learning ap-
proaches and provide the experience of blended learning to the students.

Researchers have reported that use of innovative online tools combined with appropri-
ate focus on student interactions in a blended physics course increased the students learn-
ing capacity and boosted a high-level of self-reported enjoyment (Ramma, Bholoa, Watts,
& Nadal, 2018). There are also studies that point to the critical nature of student’s online
engagement for achieving the course outcomes like critical thinking abilities and practical
competence (Trowler & Trowler, 2010). Careful design of online activities to engage stu-
dents in a flipped setting allows teachers to plan the f2f sessions more effectively to engage
students at higher-order learning activities (Beer, Clark, & Jones, 2010). However, most
teachers face both intrinsic and extrinsic barriers — access to relevant technology tools
and support, attitude and belief towards technology, ability to design lessons that promote
learner engagement and critical thinking that limit the adaptation of new technological
tools for an effective blended learning experience (Johnson, Jacovina, Russell, & Soto,
2016). While the extrinsic problems can be tackled through policy and institutional sup-
port, the intrinsic problems require multi-pronged strategy.

In the current study, we explore the design of a flipped learning experience in an under-
graduate physics course by focusing on promoting learner engagement in both online
(flipped) and classroom (face-to-face) settings. This design is informed by existing research-
based and is supported by a technology environment that assists the teacher with critical ana-
lytics information. The larger research objective of this paper is to look at how learning de-
signs for engagement increase the effectiveness in a blended learning setting. The paper is
organized as follows: The section II, describes the existing literature, Section III analyzes the
pedagogical and technological foundation of current work and the Flip & Pair (F&P) orches-
tration strategy, section IV explains the research methods and data collections used to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of the F&P strategy. Section V & VI presents the results and discussions
respectively. Along with the results, we provide some reflections from the instructor perspec-
tive while adapting the F&P strategy, limitations and future work.

Related literature

The flipped classroom is one of the popular blended learning models adopted by
educators worldwide (Hamdan et al., 2013). Application of flipped model in the
physics domain has shown that it works well for the motivated students to increase
their ability to learn in a self-paced manner. Researched pedagogical strategies de-
signed to inculcate reflective learning practice is one of the possible solutions to
achieve the learning goals and outcomes of flipped classroom strategy (Hamdan
et al., 2013). Effective Integration of digitalized tools within the flipped learning
can be further supported to strengthen and create more flexible teaching-learning
environment. Here, we first highlight different technology based AL interventions
that are reported in the literature in context of flipped online learning. Next, we
provide references to various AL strategies designed for the f2f classroom, particu-

larly, in the context of physics education.

Technology tools for flipped classroom

The flipped model utilizes a variety of technology tools to engage learners outside the
classroom and then require teachers to engage students in higher order activities inside
the classroom (Henrie, Halverson, & Graham, 2015). Videos are one popular technol-
ogy tool used in flipped learning. Studies have highlighted that educational videos could
effectively enhance conceptual attainment and assist students to illustrate hard-to-
visualize phenomena (Guo, Kim, & Robin, 2014). To enhance learning from an educa-
tional video, it is suggested to keep videos targeted on learning goals (Hsin & Cigas,
2013), reduce cognitive load by designing a short lecture video and avoid abrupt transi-
tions (Kim et al. 2014). Few other studies have reported that embedding interactive
videos with guiding questions maximizes the student retention and also act as an impli-
cit way of sharing the learning outcomes (Lin et al, 2017; Brame, 2015). There are also
other technology tools like simulations and e-text provided through learning manage-
ment systems that have been attempted by instructors (Chen, Stelzer, & Gladding,
2010; Sadaghiani, 2011). Use of web-based instructional tools has invigorated interest
in data-driven education due to the scope to collect and analyze large data using tech-
nology platforms (Imran, 2019; Kay, 2011). Rachel et al. (2020) have provided insights
on how to utilize the click-stream data tool to appropriately shape the instructional de-
sign of a lecture video and to examine the student’s self-regulated learning. Recently
Ogata et al., (2018) have developed the learning analytics tools to extract pieces of evi-
dence from log data and to harness the power of technology-enhanced teaching-
learning practice considering contextual teaching-learning practices.

In an earlier research, Sadaghiani (2011) had provided empirical findings on how the
web-based content such as the multimedia learning modules, computer simulations, and
e-Text improved student engagement in a physics course. The blended course had
students attempt the e-content and followed it up with a mini-assignment (in the form of
questions) before moving to f2f classroom sessions (Linghong & Tang, 2017; Teheran et
al., 2010). Yet another study in the physics domain shows that the web-based pre-lectures
developed using the multimedia learning modules prepare the student better for a f2f
introductory physics lectures and also makes the course less difficult (Chen et al., 2010;
Stelzer et al, 2010). This study also utilized a similar methodology of following up
Kannan et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:34 Page 4 of 23

e-content with mini assignment questions (termed pre-flight questions) to ensure
conceptual clarity. These studies show that using the digitalized tools alone does not
automatically guarantee an improved learning effectiveness or student satisfaction and
there has to be appropriate pedagogical designs that allow teachers to dynamically adapt
the instructional strategy (Ferreira, de Oliveira, & Aratijo, 2019).

Active learning in face-to-face class of flipped classroom

The research conducted especially for the tertiary level undergraduate physics courses has
shown that it is quite difficult to learn physics with the traditional teaching (TT) method
(Bach, 2007; Bonwell, 1996). One of the major challenges being faced is to engage stu-
dents in the higher order tasks using the TT method. With the monotonous mode of f2f
lecturing and a passive listening tendency, many students get distracted easily to off-task
activities. In contrast, the AL strategies implemented within the f2f class demands the stu-
dents to get into a sustained mode of engagement and learning (Mintzes & Walter, 2020).
Thus, the researchers have employed various AL pedagogies to facilitate the students to par-
ticipate actively in the f2f class and to remove any learning difficulties by way of collaborative
and reflective learning practices. With these interactive learning strategies, there are reports
that highlights on a positive shift in the student’s attitude and beliefs about learning physics
subject (Kannan & Gouripeddi, 2018; Zhang, Ding, & Mazur, 2017). Some of the innovative
f2f instructional strategies includes the peer instruction (PI) (Crouch, & Mazur, 2001),
project-based learning (Barron et al., 1998), think-pair-share (Raba, 2017; McTighe & Lyman,
1988), adaptive learning (Peter Brusilovsky, 2003), jigsaw method (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997),
etc., all of which are based on cooperative learning.

Several educational researchers have substantially proven with evidence that the PI
pedagogy offer a great potential to significantly improve the learning as compared to
the TT, in context to the Physics courses at college or University (Meltzer, & Thornton,
2012). Empirical studies of PI methods have shown that it helps to solve any specific
learning difficulties in the Physics concept and the students taught via PI score signifi-
cantly higher grades than an equivalent traditional teaching method (Meltzer, & Thorn-
ton, 2012). Another instance on the research conducted with the Jigsaw method, one of
the cooperative learning models has shown a better academic achievement in case of
the undergraduate Physics laboratory practices as compared to confirmatory laboratory
method. Tanel & Enrol (2008) have analyzed the experimental teaching sequence using
the jigsaw technique to Physics courses and established that the students who have dif-
ficulty to learn difficult concepts such as magnetism or electricity were able to learn
better. More recent study on the impact of Team-based learning (TBL) in an introduc-
tory Physics course, indicate that TBL is a less intimidating classroom format (Michele,
Rose, George, & Zuleyha, 2020). Their findings also showed that the students appreci-
ate the instant feedback as it helped them to learn more quickly and kept them engaged
in f2f class. They expressed that the peer explanations in the TBL method to be the
most valuable to keep them motivated and accountable.

To summarize, we see that some format of peer learning is seen as beneficial strategy
for Physics classrooms for entire set of students. Thus if we were to couple the technol-
ogy based out-of-class sessions with peer-learning based f2f sessions, there is a high
likelihood of meaningful learning happening for our learners.

Motivation

The context being described in the current paper is to implement flipped learning for a
Physics course of regular undergraduate engineering program in Indian University. The
context is particularly challenging due to the instructor-mediated nature of regular f2f
sessions, strict technology policies implemented within the institution and the attitude
of learners towards Physics course. The current academic policies related to use of
technology within the classroom restrict teachers to make use of only presentation
technologies (Computer and Projector). Effective blending of research-based pedagogies
with technology-mediated learning and then to follow-up with a corrective measure be-
comes extremely laborious. Further, even though knowledge of fundamental Physics
principles is core to the understanding of engineering applications, Engineering Physics
is often treated by students as a mandatory first year subject that they have to success-
fully pass. These facts make the adoption of AL strategies within a flipped classroom
setting in the present context meaningful.

To successfully blend technology and f2f sessions we adopt a Flip & Pair (F&P)
pedagogy within our flipped classroom course. In case of F&P, in addition to the
flip phase online learning, there were several regular f2f classes. Both the f2f class
and the flip online phase had an active-learning component as a possible solution.
For example, the material in flip phase was provided with the learning activities
based on learner-centric MOOCs, (LCM) pedagogical model and during the f2f
class, we adapt the PI strategy. The authors have previously reported the prelimin-
ary observations on adaption of LCM pedagogy in context to blended Physics
course (Kannan & Gouripeddi, 2019). Further, a case study of the data-driven val-
idation of the blended Physics course were reported using the learning logs of stu-
dents (Kuromiya, Majumdar, Warriem, & Ogata, 2019). The present work mainly
focuses on orchestrating the LCM pedagogy with the support of learning analytics
(LAView) dashboard tool of TEEL (Technology-enhanced and Evidence-based Edu-
cation and Learning) platform. The TEEL platform provide us with several techno-
logical affordances in terms of creating evidences for student engagement while the
LCM pedagogy assists to curate the contents within the AL environment. Our
present study would address to some of these challenges and tries to bring-in a
better relevance to the domain of physics education in context with the tertiary

level engineering program in India.

Description of the Flip & Pair (F&P) orchestration strategy

Creating blended contents using learner-centric MOOCs

In the current work, we adopt the Learner-Centric MOOCs (LCM) model as an in-
structional design guide to design the flipped contents in the F&P strategy and
utilize the learner analytics dashboard tools to analyze its effectiveness. The LCM
model is “a prescriptive model consisting of a set of guidelines, activity formats
and actions for MOOC creators” proposed by Murthy et al. (2018). The model em-
phasizes interactive activities rather than traditional information transfer and main-
tains a learner-centric pedagogy as its main orchestration. Figure 1 depicts the
overview of the pedagogical basis of the LCM model that consists of four active-

learning structural components with a unique interaction line as follows.

1. Learning dialogue (LeD): A short video with explicit reflection spots to promote
concept attainment through learner interaction. It allows the learners to express
prior conceptions, perform micro-practice or reflect. The instructor poses a
multiple-choice question (MCQ) type question or activity, wherein, the students
are expected to pause the video and respond to the question or activity.

2. Learning by Doing (LbD): Formative assessment activities with customized and
constructive feedback.

3. Learning Extension Trajectories (LxT): advanced resource materials to diversify
student’s learning.

4. Learning Experience Interaction (LxI): a discussion forum activity, which cultivates
the student interaction via structured discussion through the pre-set focus ques-
tions. The focus questions drive and keep the discussion centered on a specific
topic, and ensures learner connect within MOOCs settings (Banerjee, Warriem, &
Mishra, 2018).

Description of TEEL platform

We orchestrated our physics course on the TEEL (Technology-enhanced and Evidence-
based Education and Learning) platform (Ogata et al., 2018). It has five components, as
shown in Fig. 2. The available literature report addresses a few of the challenges related to
engagement and learning of students and strongly recommends using the learning analyt-
ics tools to evaluate the engagement and to support evidence-based learning. Extracting
the learning log-data from the e-learning platform could then be helpful to redefine the
instructional process and to provide feedback as suggested by Ogata et al. (2018).

The Learning Behavior Sensors captures the learner’s and teacher’s interaction data
during a teaching-learning session. It offers MOODLE as the Learning Management
System (LMS) and can integrate other e-learning tools. For instance, we used BookRoll
(Ogata et al., 2015), an e-book reader. In BookRoll, the teachers share materials like
their lecture slides and other reading material which the students can read and

annotate with doubts. BookRoll can automatically log the student’s reading behavior

and store it in the Learning Record Store (LRS). It is then available to both teachrs and
students for analysis and reflection through the learning dashboard LAViEW (Majum-
dar, Akcapinar, Akcapinar, Flanagan, & Ogata, 2019). LAViEW contains various panels of
visualized indicators for monitoring and plays a central role to assist and identify problems in
the teaching-learning scenario based on analysis of the visualized indicators. The other com-
ponents are Evidence Record Store (ERS) and Evidence Portal. The Evidence Portal can be
used to record the teaching-learning problem that the teacher identifies in LAViEW. The
teacher can think of possible solutions to mitigate it and then monitor its effectiveness. Evi-
dence Portal has an evidence analytics system which extracts evidence from LRS and meta-
analyse evidence record in ERS. Thus the TEEL infrastructure integrates the features of the
eReader, LMS and Dashboard within a single service so that teachers can seamlessly move
across the technology. In the current study, we used the TEEL platform to orchestrate the
F&P strategy.

Flip-phase - online component

During the flip phase, we provided learner-centric activities as proposed in the LCM
pedagogical model (as discussed in section II C). We divided each module of EPH 106
course into different sub-topics. For each topic, we created a full set of LCM learning
activities. For example, Fig. 3 depicts the screenshot of flip-phase activity created for
one of the topics, “X-ray diffraction” from the course module titled “Characterization
techniques of Nanomaterials”. An instructor can create their own LCM activities fol-
lowing the implementation steps as below.

— Provide Learning dialogue, LeD activity as short videos (less than 10 min) for
conceptual attainment. For example, we had provided four short lecture videos on
the basic concepts of X-ray diffraction, Instrumentation details and working
principle of X-ray diffractometer. Following the LeD videos, create a separate ‘label’
by using “Add an activity or resource” in the MOODLE and provide the reflection-

— Upload Learning by doing (LbD) activity as a multiple choice question (MCQ) test
with few conceptual questions. For example, in our EPH course, the questions for
the LbD quiz were selected based on the concepts being taught in the LeD videos.
To attempt the LbDs quiz, students took at least two or more attempts, as it was
intended to be a formative assessment. We graded LbDs quiz automatically in the
MOODLE.

— Provide Learning Extension Trajectories (LxT) activity, to diversify student learning.
For example, in the present course, we uploaded the powerpoint presentations
(.ppt) slides/notes, scanned book materials and solved problem sheets within the
LxT activity. We additionally augmented a URL activity with the NPTel lecture
notes (Alagarsamy, 2016) (Ray, 2017), Khan Academy or online simulator
developed by “My Scope” (Microscopy, 2019).

— Provide Learner Experience Interaction (LxI) by creating a discussion forum activity
in the MOODLE (Banerjee, Warriem, & Mishra, 2018). Give a focus question to
seed the discussions in the forum and to assist students to start a new discussion
thread for the topic provided. For example, in our course, we created a LxI as the
last activity as per the LCM learning sequence. We had given focus questions
namely “Why do we observe peaks of different heights in the XRD pattern” to initiate
the discussion thread on our target topic (as depicted in Fig. 4). The students then
created and posted replies to the focus question. Upload the full set of LCM
activities in the MOODLE, at least a week prior to the F2F sessions. Instruct

students to go through the flipped contents before the F2F sessions.

Pair-phase during F2F class component

In the present course, we conducted the f2f sessions using an AL strategy, peer instruc-
tion (PI) for only selected topics following the AB type research design (details in sec-
tion IV). We implement the PI activity with the following sequential steps: [1] Start the
f2f teaching sessions first, by revisiting the flip phase learning contents as a short

lecture using blackboard or PowerPoint (.ppt) slides. Then, initiate the PI activity on

concepts revised, by posing the PI question. [2] Instruct the students to answer the PI
question first individually. If the majority of students answer incorrectly, ask the stu-
dents to combine with 3 or 4 of their peers to form groups. [3] Initiate the pair-phase
by allowing each group to discuss the PI question for about 10 to 12 min. [4] During
the pair phase, pose one or two hint questions that assist students to have a focused
discussion and help them to arrive at the answers for PI questions. [5] Encourage stu-
dents to have effective peer-peer discussions during the pair phase. Instruct the stu-
dents not to deviate the discussion from the hint questions provided. [6] After the pair-
phase is over, pose the same PI question again to record the student responses. Check
for improvement in the correct responses. Use the Plicker’s card to collect student re-
sponses while conducting the PI activity during the f2f class (Hake, 1998). After the PI
activity, assess the overall student performance of using knowledge quiz (KQ) as pro-
posed in the LCM model. For example, in the EPH course, we conducted KQ either
using the Plickers card or TEEL platform. We designed the quiz questions with MCQ,
or True / False formats and graded them automatically in the MOODLE (Kothiyal,
Majumdar, Murthy, & Iyer, 2013).

Research method and data collection
The following are the overall research questions (RQs) addressed in the study.

RQ-1: What is the effect of F&P strategy on student’s engagement?

RQ-2: What is the effect of F&P strategy on student’s performance?

RQ-3: What are the student’s perception of learning and engagement regarding the
F&P strategy?

following the design of LCM pedagogical model (Murthy et al., 2018). We adopted the

single group quasi-experimental AB-research design, wherein, the students were ad-

ministered with two different teaching strategies in the blended physics course: (i)
Type-A called as Flip & Pair (F&P) strategy, wherein, the LCM based learning activities
for topic 1 was first flipped in TEEL platform for out-of-class learning. During f2f class,
the same topic 1 was taught using the PI activity that included a ‘pair phase’ as dis-
cussed in Section III-B (Fig. 5a) and (ii) Type-B called as Flip & Traditional Teaching
(F&TT), wherein, the LCM based learning activities for topic 2 was first flipped in the
TEEL platform for out-of-class learning. During the f2f, the same topic was taught
using traditional teaching (TT) without any collaborative learning activity (Fig. 5b).

Thus, both the type A and type B strategies had an AL pedagogy being included in
the flip phase component, while it differed only in the teaching methodology adapted
in the f2f class. This AB research design was repeated for three rounds on multiple
equivalent topics across the whole semester (topics dealt are shown in Table 1). How-
ever, in the present study, the data used to compare the effectiveness of PI are only
from the third round of AB design implementation, while first two rounds were used
to get the students adapted with the research design. The specific target topics and
LCM learning objects from which, the student’s MOODLE access report and the quiz
performance scores were analyzed are listed in the Table 2. To check for the topics
equivalence, we verified the following aspects: (i) learning time required, (ii) complexity
level (iii) similarity in prerequisites of knowledge to learn the topics. We also triangu-
lated the student perception about the equivalence and difficulty levels for both the tar-
get topics chosen. Care was taken to maintain the same duration of f2f class hours to
teach the topics dealt for type-A and type-B interventions.

dents with the specialization (major) in electronics and communication. A total of 59
students were registered for the ‘Physics of Nanomaterials’ course (EPH 106) during
the second semester. EPH 106 consisted of five modules and the same instructor taught
the whole course. Each module was taught for a duration of twelve to fifteen 50-min
lecture hours. The total duration to teach the course was sixty-five lecture hours for
the whole semester. In the f2f component, few topics were taught via traditional teach-
ing method and few of them using PI. Further, the learning contents were provided in
the flip phase component, which used the TEEL MOODLE platform, wherein, every
student was enrolled individually. The students were first briefed about the instruc-
tional design before the implementation. Table 3 presents the details of the data col-

lected corresponding to the different constructs which are investigated in the research.

Engagement analysis
To address RQ-1, we analyzed the engagement of students in the content related to
topics dealt in each of these strategies. We analysed the access frequency of the LCM
learning contents provided for only the specific target topics (as listed in Table 2) to
characterize the student engagement during the flip-phase activity in both the F&P and
F&TT strategy. We counted the access frequencies to all the learning materials in the
target topics orchestrated by F&P and F&TT method. Out of total 54 students, we used
only N= 42 student’s log for this comparison as they were found to access the online
LCM materials present in both the strategies.

Recently, Kothiyal et al. (2013) have developed and validated a ‘Classroom Interactive En-
gagement Observation Protocol’ an instrument to observe the student’s behavior during the

‘Think-Pair-Share (TPS)’ activity in the f2f class. In this work, we had utilized those ‘observa-
tion protocol items’ to characterize the student engagement behavior during the ‘Pair-phase’
activity. Based on our raw observations of 14 different types of behaviors, we further classified
them into three major engagement categories: actively engaged, passively engaged and not en-
gaged. For example: talking to peers on topic, listening to peers, asking questions about the
topic, group discussion, responding to teacher’s questions are termed as ‘actively engaged’.
Whereas, reading or looking at one’s own or neighbor’s book, writing in a notebook, etc. are
termed as ‘passively engaged’ and sleeping, talking off-topic, playing with mobile, sleeping
head down, looking around the room and so on are termed at ‘not engaged’.

Performance analysis

To address the RQ - 2, we compared the post-test mean scores obtained by students
after the F&P as against the F&TT strategy. For the post-tests, the student’s learning
was evaluated for two different topics, for which the topic equivalence was checked as
discussed in Section IV-A. Additionally, we implemented a similar type of KQ ques-
tions to maintain the same nature of testing for both the strategies. Though we adopted
the two topics research design, we justify that both the post-tests are still comparable
with each other. For the F&P test there were scores of 44 learners and for the F&TT,
there were scores of 38 learners. Out of the cohort, 24 learners participated in both the
tests. Based on the distribution of the score, as it did not satisfy normality condition
(skewness = — 1.189997 for F&P and-0.785146 for F&TT), we conducted a non-
parametric Mann Whitney U test to evaluate the differences (see Table 4 for results).

Perception analysis

To answer the RQ-3, we collected the student perception on learning, engagement and
usefulness. At the end of the course, an online survey questionnaire was provided to
the students. It had 17 survey items (7 items related to engagement, 6 items related to
learning and 4 related to usefulness) with a 5 Likert scale (refer to Tables — Al to A3).
It is to be noted that our students are in the first year engineering physics course and
they experience the online flipped learning for the first time. Hence, the items in the
survey questionnaire were designed mainly to understand the generic perception of stu-
dents about the LCM learning activities in the flipped phase, that is present in common
for both the F&P and F&TT strategies. However, one of the items (Item No - 7 in
Tabe-1) was particularly related to the PI activity during the f2f sessions. The responses
for the perception questionnaire was collected and analyzed from a total number of
students, N= 51. Further, two open-ended questions were posed to collect the students’
opinions on (i) using the online learning tools in the MOODLE platform and (ii) stu-
dent’s preferred sequence of access of LCM learning objects with respect to the in-
structor prescribed sequence: LeD - > LbD - > LxT - > LxI.

Results

Effects on students engagement

Online engagement for F&P and F&TT strategies

The relationship between students’ engagement and teaching strategies was shown in Fig. 6. It
shows that there was more students’ access frequency in F&P strategy materials than F&TT
materials. The difference between the two strategies was statistically significant in LbD, LeD,
and LxT (p< .01). The difference was not statistically significant in LxI (p = .90).

In-class engagement during pair phase

Figure 7 shows the analysis of the observation protocol data collected during the ‘pair
phase’ of the PI activity. Our observation protocol data indicated that the nearly 25.9%
of students being constructively discussing with their peers on the given task and nearly
19.20% were listening to the peers and finally, 18.20% were doing a group discussion
(more than three) during peer instructional activities. Thus, we could observe that to-
tally 67% of students displayed ‘actively engaged’ behavior, 18% displayed ‘passively en-
gaged’, and finally 15% were ‘not engaged’ on an average for all four PI activities
measured. The observation protocol data was further triangulated with the student’s
perception of engagement during the ‘pair phase’ of PI activity. The perception data
showed that nearly 58% of students self-reported to be actively engaged, 35% reported
being passively engaged, and 7% not engaged during the activity.

Effects on students’ performance

Table 4 highlights the difference of the post-test scores of students on the KQ con-
ducted for different topics of F&P and F&TT strategies. A higher mean score (M = 7.81
out of 10, SD = 2.11) was obtained for F&P as compared to that of the mean post-test

Mann Whitney U test between the post-test score showed that the differences were sta-

tistically significant (U = 1358.5, p < 0.05). Thus the KQ post-test score analysis inferred
that the F&P had better learning effectiveness when compared to the F&TT type of
intervention. The observed effect size is 0.54 which can be considered as a moderate
treatment effect. When the analysis was repeated only for paired sample (1 = 24), per-
formance during the F&P knowledge quiz still remained significantly better than F&TT
quiz (U = 116.5, p = 0.00013) with moderate effect size.

Student’s perception analysis

The RQ-3 was answered by corroborating the student perception of engagement with
that of engagement results obtained from the access log data in the TEEL platform Fig.
8a. The student’s self-reported average engagement time in the flip phase activities is
shown in the Fig. 8b. We observed that the students showed a high perception of en-
gagement for all the LCM activities including the LeDs, LbDs and LxT resources. How-
ever, the students were found to be less encouraged to participate in in the Lxl
discussion forum activity was found to be. Fig. 9 shows that a considerable number of
students had a high perception of learning from the LeDs (72%) and LbDs (74%) activ-
ities. Nearly 73% of students reported that the LxT activities helped them to diversify
their learning. In contrast to other LCM elements, only 65% of students perceived the
LxI forum as an important component of learning. Student’s perception of engagement
in the flip activities showed a high level of satisfaction for both LeDs and LxT re-
sources, while engagement in discussion forum activity was perceived to be low as
shown in Fig. 9. The student preferred to get engaged in following access sequence:
LeDs (44%) — LxTs (37%) — LbDs (13%) — LxIs (6%).The students considered a high
perception of usefulness for the F&P activities as shown in Fig. 10, where 67% of the
students agreed that they will be happy if the other teachers would adopt the F&P
teaching strategy for their courses. When the students were given choices to opt for
the self-estimated total time spent per day on the LCM activities, nearly 49% of

Reflections from the instructor

Presently, we adapt the LCM model to design the learning activities of flip phase as fol-
lows: LeDs as videos — LbDs as Quizzes — learning resources as LxTs — discussion
forum as LxIs. From the log data report as obtained from LAView analytics, we inferred
a poor engagement of students in the flipped activities during the first few weeks of im-
plementation, though we orchestrated them with learner-centric activities. This obser-
vation is in accordance with the case study reported by Li, 2018 (Li, 2018), which
highlights the possible reasons as (i) student’s inadaptability to the e-learning platform,
(ii) instructional design or (iii) teacher’s inadequate knowledge of the prerequisite prac-
tice required. In the present study, integrating a learner-centric pedagogy, the F&P re-
search design within the BL course is a first attempt the instructor has made for an

new instructional design until they got familiarized with the instructional design. It also
facilitated the instructor to improvise the design with respect to the present teaching
context and also to get appropriate control of implementation.

Additionally, to improve the engagement in the TEEL platform, few key measures
were prompted during the f2f sessions. This step further improved the online engage-
ment of students considerably. The measures taken were (i) augmenting the LxTs with
NPTel videos and lecture notes (SantiramKal, 2004), (ii) incentivize those students who
engage in flip phase activities, (iii) group activities in LxI to post, create or reply in dis-

cussion forum activity, (iv) counselling students who showed poor engagement and

performance. These students were provided with required extra learning materials to
bridge the lack of fundamental knowledge, Prior to the mid- or end-semester examina-
tions, the important learning resources were provided within the LxTs activity. This
allowed many students to revisit the learning objects in MOODLE multiple times,
thereby increasing the access frequency of the log data. Finally, (v) the students were
asked to practice the theoretical concepts being taught for the target topics of electron
microscopy and X-ray diffraction using the open-source online simulations developed

T™?)

by ‘My Scope™ (Microscopy, 2019). MyScope™ is an online training tool to learn differ-
ent types of scanning probe and diffraction techniques. The learners were able to virtu-
ally operate these high-end machines to get a realistic operational experience. Students
had the freedom to change the working mode of operation, vacuum conditions and differ-
ent type of samples. Other parameters could be varied such as the accelerating voltage,
beam spot size, scan speed and the working distances to achieve the required magnifica-
tion and resolution of the final imaging. The step-by-step instructional guide with appro-
priate background knowledge, diagrams and many other extended learning web-resources
provided within the MyScope website facilitated the students to explore and learn indi-
vidually. These online simulators helped the students to improve the active engagement
capacity through the kinesthetic learning. More importantly, the students felt it safe to
make mistakes without any fear while operating these machines virtually.

Discussion and conclusions

Inferences from the study

The research design adopted in our current study aims to compare the F&P versus F&TT
strategies with the AB research design. In both the types, the online flip phase contents
were augmented with learning activities based on pedagogical design of the LCM. It is to
be noted that these two strategies differed only in the teaching method adapted during
the f2f class, wherein, the F&P had an active PI-based learning activities while it was the
traditional teaching for F&TT. We had totally implemented three rounds of the AB re-
search design for equivalent topics (as listed in Table-1). However, according to the in-
structor’s observation, the students did not understand the flipped classroom method
during the initial few weeks of implementation. Hence, the first two rounds of AB design
were used to allow the students, to get adapted to the flipped classroom method, tools of
TEEL (LMS) platform and the learning activities based on the LCM pedagogy.

To evaluate the effectiveness of research design, first, we extracted and analyzed the
student access frequency for target materials (as listed in Table 2) provided in the flip
phase for both the F&P and F&TT strategies. The overall access frequency extracted
for the learning activities across the whole semester inferred that the average number
of log access was higher for the contents taught with the F&P strategy when compared
to the F&TT (Fig. 6). The higher log access frequency in the flip phase activities for
both teaching strategies infer that the students were able to effectively utilize and learn
from the LCM online learning materials throughout the semester. Our present flipped-
learning course can be corroborated with the research highlights by Brame et al.
(Brame, 2015) on the higher student learning engagement achieved from interactive on-
line videos. In accordance to their reports, we observed that the reflection spots pro-
vided in the LeD videos had facilitated the students engagement, thus enabling higher
Kannan et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:34 Page 18 of 23

learning to take place. This could be further evidenced from the new discussion threads
created by the students in the LxI forum activity attempting to answer the reflection spot
questions. Similarly, the LxTs with diverse resources from the NPTel lecture notes has
helped students to attain conceptual acquisition and supported the extended learning.

The student’s engagement behavior during the pair-phase activity of F&P strategy
was characterized using the observation protocol items (Kothiyal et al., 2013). This
study indicated that the majority of students exhibited ‘actively engaged’ behavior dur-
ing the Pair-phase of the PI activity. As pointed out by Hamdan et al. (Hamdan et al.,
2013), the flipped classroom strategy demands the students to engage in flip contents
before the f2f sessions, and during the class they need to perform task-oriented higher-
order activities on the same contents under the facilitation of instructor. However, in
contrast, with respect to the F&TT (Type-B intervention), the students mostly exhib-
ited passive listening during the f2f traditional lecturing sessions. The students were
neither concerned to raise their doubts nor responded to any interactive learning ef-
forts made by the instructor. Our study supports different existing literature on the
flipped teaching implemented for multiple teaching-learning contexts that the trad-
itional teaching leads to the passive listening of students (Goodwin & Miller, 2013).
Few of our students did not get engaged in the flipped activities due to the low motiv-
ation towards the online learning and other logistic issues such as the poor internet
connectivity, etc. Hence, in our present teaching-learning context, the instructor had to
revisit the flip-phase contents again during the f2f sessions.

While comparing the access frequencies between F&P and F&TT strategies, we ob-
served statistically significant differences in the access frequency for all the LCM learn-
ing components except for LxI forum activity. The incentives provided for students
participating in LxI forum may be the plausible reason for a lack of significant differ-
ence between access frequencies in both the strategies. However, the same effect is not
observed for other LCM components. In the current scenario, we indicate that compar-
ing the access frequency between these two strategies is still valid as we adopted similar
flip phase learning design for both F&P and F&TT type of interventions. To justify our
results on higher access frequency for the F&P intervention, we decipher that the con-
tents dealt with active-learning PI pedagogy during the f2f class sessions has helped the
students to engage and learn those content with more clarity. The peer-peer collabora-
tive learning activities has fostered the student’s interests to enhance their motivation
to revisit the same learning materials provided in the flip phase, even after the f2f ses-
sions were over. We infer that this might be one of the reasons to enhance the access
frequency for F&P type of intervention. Furthermore, the access frequency data was re-
liable because the results were consistent over three components in the LCM model
(LeD, LbD and LxT) except for LxI. The performance analysis using paired t-test on
the post-test scores of F&P and F&TT revealed a statistically significant p-value (p<
0.05) and better mean score as compared to F&TT. We also infer that F&P method
contributed better to achieve the higher quiz score more than F&TT. We show that
improved engagement during the F&P strategy has positively correlated with the stu-
dent performances. The increase in the mean score for F&P showed that the teaching
using the collaborative learning strategy PI within f2f settings had led to the better con-
ceptual learning of materials. Students being engaged both during Pair phase and the
flip phase activities in case of the F&P strategy, emerges to be an important factor to
Kannan et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:34 Page 19 of 23

explain the improved performance and satisfaction of students. Our observation sup-
ports the literature that reports an engagement stimulated by flipped learning pedagogy
is inherently satisfying to students independent of their perceptions of performance.
(Fisher, Birdthistle, & Perényi, 2018).

We further obtained the student perception on the F&P blended course. We con-
ducted an unstructured interview with 8 students selected based on the low, medium
and high performers. We obtained the student’s reflections on three open-ended ques-
tions. The first question assessed how did the F&P strategy help to enhance learning of
physics concepts, and whether the strategy can be adapted as a method of active in-
struction by other instructors?. The second question investigated on what kind of chal-
lenges the students faced while using the new learning tools of TEEL platform? .
Finally, the third question was on which of the LCM learning activity was useful for the
conceptual attainment while considering flipped classroom? . Regarding the first ques-
tion, students expressed that each of LCM activity was unique and helped them to bet-
ter understand the physics concepts. Irrespective of performance, the students who
were interviewed told that this new flipped teaching motivated their interest to learn
physics subject as a full course. They expressed that they could find all the relevant
learning materials at one place (MOODLE) to read them before any upcoming mid- or
end-semester exams. Additionally, the students were quite motivated to learn through
peer-peer discussions in the f2f class. Some students felt it difficult to understand the
format of PI activities initially but later-on found it very interactive. Additionally, they
expressed that providing the answers for PI questions using the Plicker cards made the
PI activity more interesting and engaging. Some students felt that there were noisy dis-
turbances from other students during the PI activity that led them difficult to concen-
trate on the tasks given. Thus, the perception survey analysis showed that a larger
percentage of students exhibited positive perception of learning from F&P. They could
utilize the effectiveness of AL pedagogies of both the LCM and PI. Nevertheless, few of
the students whom we identified as poor performers seemed to have prejudice that phys-
ics courses would be boring. These students also expressed that they had never been in-
terested to learn the subject with a better conceptual clarity. They just studied physics
only to pass the examination even during their school education. It seemed to be crucial
to change this low perception of learning basic science courses at this juncture of first-
year engineering, which is only possible by adapting AL pedagogies. With regard to the
second question on challenges while handling the technology tools, most of the students
expressed that the BookRoll, an ebook reader as provided in the TEEL platform was new
to them and it was quite useful to annotate their doubts. However, they required more
mobile-friendly features and better training to handle the same. There were many other
challenges such as possessing individual laptops and gadgets, time restrictions in internet
availability for hostel students. Further, when alternated with their mobile data connection
to attempt MOODLE quizzes, they were facing low connectivity issues.

The student response to the third question pointed out that most of them agreed to
the fact that learning from the LeD videos and LxT resources were quite helpful. They
got benefited from being able to revisit the videos and explore the learning materials
multiple times at their own pace. Majority of students mentioned that the LxI posts/re-
plies are not getting diverse responses. Additionally, there were lack of coherence in a
LxI replies which reduced the overall motivation of students. Few students also
Kannan et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:34 Page 20 of 23

reported that they were not clear about the operating aspects of MOODLE, for ex-
ample, ‘reply to’, ‘posts’, etc. of LxI forum. The LxI activity allowed the students and the
teachers to exchange ideas by posting queries/doubts, as part of a ‘discussion thread’.
Thus, the role of an instructor is crucial to provide clear directions to guide and moderate
the LxI activity along with a timely feedback. The student perception analysis could be
correlated with that of the instructor’s observation on the discussion forum activities. We
found that the quality of post created was not of a good standard and students just copied
the contents from Google or Wikipedia. The discussion threads did not show any coher-
ent replies beyond 3 or 4 threads. However, few of the good performers gave thoughtful
answers and replied to the queries raised in their peers’ post. The quality of reply, regular
engagement of poor performers in the LxI forum was not very evident. It is also correlated
with that of the poor perception exhibited for learning from Lxls. We infer that the sig-
nificant relation between the engagement of students in the forum activity with that of
the performance score could be less prominent.

From the present study, we show that the F&P strategy could be effectively integrated into the
flipped classroom for undergraduate engineering students. We recommend that the students and
teachers need to be primed to get adapted with the instructional strategy and technology tools in
MOODLE. Further, integrating the LCM based pedagogical activities such as the LeDs as the
short videos, Quizzes as LbDs, LxT's as resource materials, a discussion forum as the LxIs and

the knowledge quizzes are necessary to create a meaningful learning experience in the flip phase.

Limitations and future work

We identify a few limitations while implementing the present research design. To
bring-in the contextual improvisations, we had deviated from the originally proposed
LCM model with respect to the orchestration of learner-centric activities (Murthy
et al., 2017; Murthy et al., 2018). For example, we did not provide the customized feed-
back for LbD quiz as instructed in the LCM model. Then, the reflection spots were not
embedded within the LeD videos. Instead, it was provided as a separate label in the
MOODLE course page. Further, the assimilation quiz or reflection quiz was not
adapted. This was because, the instructor is a novice practitioners of educational re-
search and took time to get acquainted with the new features of TEEL tool and the op-
erational aspects of the MOODLE. Others limitations are in the methods of evaluation.
The AB research design is a single group post-test analysis limited to the test score for
only two target topics. Thus, AB design within the blended course needs to be tested
for multiple topics having more number of baseline and treatment data points.

We measured the quantitative engagement data using the learning log data in LMS.
Though there is an indication that key measures have enhanced the frequency of log access
counts, in the LCM activities, we could not adequately create instances for cognitive engage-
ment within the online content. Thus, it is highly desirable to use more effective tools to
collect real-time evidence of engagement and learning. Furthermore, the indicator we used,
ie., access count in MOODLE for each LCM component is considered as a proxy for stu-
dent engagement. Hence other indicators such as ‘time duration’, or ‘type of engagement in
activity’ will be used for future studies. Lastly, we consider the F&P strategy was imple-
mented and studied in a very specific socio-cultural context and for a particular subject
course. Future studies should aim to investigate its generalizability in another context.
