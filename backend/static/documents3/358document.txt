Abstract

This paper presents the optimization of the inverse distance weighting method (IDW) in the process of creating a digital terrain
model (DTM) of the seabed based on bathymetric data collected using a multibeam echosounder (MBES). There are many
different methods for processing irregular measurement data into a grid-based DTM, and the most popular of these methods are
inverse distance weighting (IDW), nearest neighbour (NN), moving average (MA) and kriging (K). Kriging is often considered
one of the best methods in interpolation of heterogeneous spatial data, but its use is burdened by a significantly long calculation
time. In contrast, the MA method 1s the fastest, but the calculated models are less accurate. Between them is the IDW method,
which gives satisfactory accuracy with a reasonable calculation time. In this study, the author optimized the IDW method used in
the process of creating a DTM seabed based on measurement points from MBES. The goal of this optimization was to
significantly accelerate the calculations, with a possible additional increase in the accuracy of the created model. Several variants
of IDW methods were analysed (dependent on the search radius, number of points in the interpolation, power of the interpolation
and applied smoothing method). Finally, the author proposed an optimization of the IDW method, which uses a new technique of
choosing the nearest points during the interpolation process (named the growing radius). The experiments presented in the paper
and the results obtained show the true potential of the IDW optimized method in the case of DTM estimation.

Introduction
Creating a seabed DTM

Research on seabeds is the most common and important task
conducted by hydrographic institutions, and the created
models are the basic information repository for further analy-
sis and visualization. Users of GIS systems, including those
containing bathymetric data, demand reliable, accurate and
up-to-date data and place high demands on the dynamics of
data processing, visualization and analysis in real time.

To create a seabed digital terrain model (DTM), it is first
necessary to take marine measurements. Modern measuring

systems with devices that enable the recording of observation
results in a continuous manner (e.g. multibeam echosounders—
MBESs) can obtain a very large amount of information about
the shape of the seabed in a relatively short time. These systems
record the location and depth (spatial coordinates x, y, z) of
many millions of points during one measurement session. The
processing of such a large amount of data that is additionally
irregularly dispersed in space requires the use of specially pre-
pared numerical methods and appropriately selected data pro-
cessing algorithms (Burrough and McDonnell 1998). In GIS
systems, DTM of the seabed surface is often described using a
grid structure (regular square network). There are many
methods of creating a grid based on measurement data, with
the most commonly used interpolation methods being mini-
mum curvature, natural neighbour, nearest neighbour, modified
Shepard’s method, radial basis function, inverse distance to a
power, triangulation with linear interpolation, moving average,
kriging, polynomial regression and methods based on artificial
intelligence (Chin-shung et al. 2004; Wlodarczyk-Sielicka and

g) Springer
398

Stateczny 2016; Wlodarczyk-Sielicka et al. 2016; Maleika et al.
2012; Rishikeshan et al. 2014). These methods use several dif-
ferent algorithms to determine the new values at grid nodes.
The selection of the optimal interpolation method for unevenly
distributed measurement data depends on a number of features
that characterize the dataset: the homogeneity of data disper-
sion, number of points per area unit, population variance (de-
gree of data changeability) and the type of surface reflected by
the data.

The inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, a determin-
istic spatial interpolation model, is one of the most popular
methods adopted by geoscientists and geographers and has
been implemented in many GIS packages. The general pre-
mise of this method is that the attribute values of any given
pair of points are related to each other, but their similarity is
inversely related to the distance between the two locations (Lu
and Wong 2008).

The disadvantage of using the IDW method in processing
large datasets is the computing time. Compared with other
methods, the DTM creation time can be up to 5 times longer
than the fast-moving average method (Maleika et al. 2012). A
reasonable question is whether it is possible to optimize the
general IDW method for processing large bathymetric datasets
in the process of creating a grid-based DTM. The goal of such
optimization is to significantly increase the speed of the cal-
culations while maintaining and perhaps even increasing the
accuracy of the created model.

Source of errors and IHO standards

A significant problem when creating DTM seabed models is
the inability to accurately determine the accuracy of the creat-
ed model. This is because the actual shape of the surface being
described is unknown; consequently, the model cannot be
compared with the real surface. In practice, assessing the ac-
curacy of the model boils down to estimating and summing
the errors arising at the subsequent stages of data processing.
Usually, persons performing tests using MBES simplify the
estimation of the DTM accuracy to determine the measure-
ment accuracy of the device and ignore other possible sources
of error (such as the ship motion parameters, positioning sys-
tem, MBES configuration, bottom type, occurring depths, in-
terpolation methods used and grid resolution). They do so
because of the difficulty in estimating the values of these er-
rors and because the magnitudes of these errors, as shown by
numerous studies, are usually much smaller than the measure-
ment error (Bannari and Kadhem 2017; Kannan et al. 2015). It
is estimated that for high-class MBES devices and measure-
ments carried out in shallow waters (up to 20—30 m), this error
is approximately 5 cm. More about determining this type of
error can be found in (Maleika 2012).

Worldwide, organizations involved in hydrographic surveys
comply with the standards for hydrographic surveys

(International Hydrographic Organization 2008) issued by the
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). This publication
includes the minimum standards for hydrographic surveys,
which enables the determination of the spatial uncertainty of data.
This allows the users of the information to use the survey results
safely (merchant ships, navy, GIS users, etc.). The formula sup-
plied by the IHO is used to compute the maximum allowable
total vertical uncertainty (TVU) at a 95% confidence level
(International Hydrographic Organization 2008):

TVU = +\/a2+(b-d) (1)

where a represents the portion of the uncertainty that does not
vary with depth, 5 is a coefficient that represents the portion of
the uncertainty that varies with depth and d is the depth.

In the research presented in this article, based on the IHO
guidelines, it was assumed that a= 0.25 and b=0.0075, which
corresponds to the special class (as defined by the IHO
(International Hydrographic Organization 2008), contains areas
in which the highest quality of DTM and chart is necessary, e.g.
channels, harbours, shallow waters and rivers). For these param-
eters and the test data used, the total DTM error is 25—30 cm
(depending on the test surface). All hydrographic works, includ-
ing the use of interpolation methods in the creation of DTM,
should be carried out in accordance with the above standards.

In many papers, the authors investigate DTM interpolation
accuracy, but most studies are based on data determined from
test models at random (number and distribution of measuring
points) and directly (depth reading without considering the
measurement error). This does not correspond to reality,
where the distribution of measurement points is quite charac-
teristic for MBES (and depends on the sea survey parameters),
and each individual measurement is burdened with some ran-
dom measurement error. Therefore, the results obtained and
the conclusions regarding the properties of the interpolation
methods used for these specific data may be incorrect. The
author believes that the use of an innovative method of deter-
mining test data and the test procedure described in the
“Research” section increase the reliability of the results ob-
tained and the conclusions drawn.

There are other works describing the impact of the applied
interpolation methods on the accuracy of the created DTMs.
For example, in (Amante and Eakins 2016), the authors study
the accuracy of interpolated bathymetry in digital elevation
models. In (Amante 2018), the authors estimated the coastal
DEM uncertainty.

Methods

In this study, the IDW method is used to interpolate spatial
data, which is based on the concept of distance weighting.
Appl Geomat (2020) 12:397-407

This method can be used to estimate unknown depth data from
the known (adjacent) measured depths (Burrough and
McDonnell 1998; Bedient and Huber 1992). The IDW formu-
las are given by Eqs. 2 and 3 (Chen and Liu 2012):

R, = ye wiki (2)

d,“

nye ”
where R, represents the unknown depth data (cm); R; repre-
sents the depth data measured by MBES (cm); NV is the number
of points (in the search radius area); w,represents the
weighting of each depth; d; is the distance from each depth
to the calculated grid node; and a is the power and 1s also a
control parameter, generally assumed to be two. Several stud-
ies (e.g. (Simanton and Osborn 1980; Tung 1983)) have
experimented with variations in power, examining its effects
on the spatial distribution of information from precipitation
observations.

The IDW eridding method can be either an exact or a
smoothing interpolator. With IDW, data are weighted during
interpolation such that the influence of one point relative to
another declines with distance from the grid node. Weighting
is assigned to data using a weighting power (a) that controls
how the weighting factors drop off as the distance from a grid
node increases (Golden Software Support 2019). Considering
that the measurement data from MBES are burdened with
some random measurement error (Maleika et al. 2011), it
seems reasonable to use the IDW method with a low-power
value so that the method works slightly more smoothly. This
thesis is checked in test studies.

First, reasonable parameters for each interpolation tech-
nique were identified, as inappropriate parameters can

resolution grid (1) and reference

high-resolution grid (1) and vir-
tual survey software (3), a new
dataset with properties similar to
those of MBES source data was
calculated (4). Based on these
data, we can examine the proper-
ties of the interpolation method
obtained, and in this way, DTM

grid (2), which gives us the ability
to pinpoint the interpolation error

cause significant artefacts in the interpolated surface, es-
pecially with IDW (Akkala et al. 2010; Burrough and
McDonnell 1998). Numerous combinations of the inter-
polation parameters were evaluated using a brute-force
methodology. The parameters for each interpolation tech-
nique that resulted in the lowest median percent deviation
for the entire study area were identified and then used in
all subsequent analyses. The parameters for IDW were a
power of 2 and a variable search radius of 8 points.

The IDW interpolation method is commonly used in the
processing of various spatial data, e.g. soil moisture distribu-
tion (Srivastava et al. 2019), and surface water volume esti-
mation (Fuentes et al. 2019), and in creating digital elevation
models (Salekin et al. 2018), air pollution models (Peng et al.
2018) and many others.

In most GIS software (e.g. Surfer), the IDW method is
implemented in such way that it assigns values to points by
averaging the data inside a fixed search area (defined by the
user). There is also an option to define a minimum number of
neighbours inside the search area, which allows us to calculate
a new point value. Otherwise, the point node is set as a blank.
The power parameter may also be changed.

Research
Preparing test data

A major problem in testing and searching for the optimal
interpolation methods used in creating a DTM is the inability
to clearly identify errors arising in this process. This situation
is the result of different representations of the input (unevenly
distributed points) and output (evenly spaced points). To solve

this problem, the proprietary virtual survey program (Maleika
2013) was used to prepare the test data, enabling the genera-
tion of xyz measurement sets based on a high-resolution grid.
The created simulator includes survey parameters such as boat
speed, operating parameters of the MBES device, MBES de-
vice error and profile system. As a result of the simulator’s
activities, a new test set of xyz points is received. Research on
interpolation methods consists of creating subsequent models
based on these generated sets using various interpolation pa-
rameters. Both of these models (reference and test) are de-
scribed using a grid structure of the same size, so they can
be directly compared, and the errors can be calculated (includ-
ing the average error at the 95% confidence level). It should be
clearly underlined that in the research procedure created in this
way, the model error not only is an error resulting from the
application of the selected interpolation method but also de-
termines the total model error taking into account components
such as single device measurement error (MBES), errors
resulting from the parameters of the adopted structure grid
(depending on, e.g. grid resolution) and errors depending on
the adopted parameters of the marine survey. By changing
only the parameters related to the interpolation of the measure-
ment data, we can assess the impact of the interpolation meth-
od on the overall error of the model (for various variants),
whose “‘adjustment” depends on the parameters listed above.
The scheme for preparing the measurement data is shown in
Fig. 1.

When preparing reference surfaces using a virtual survey,
the following simulation parameters were determined:

¢ Boat speed, 4 kn;

¢ Number of beams, 127;

¢ Beam angle, 110°;

¢ Sample frequency, 10 Hz;

¢ Profile layout, parallel; overlapping, 20%;

The parameters above correspond with the parameters used
in the actual bathymetrical measurements, which were the
foundation of the reference surfaces. These simulations give
us high-density data (the distance between neighbouring
points is approximately 3 cm and 10 cm).

Reference surfaces

The research was done using three reference surfaces prepared
from real bathymetric data collected in 2017 by the Szczecin
Maritime Office in the basin Szczecin Lagoon using the
Simrad EM 3000 echosounder (Kongsberg Maritime AS,
Norway) and WGS-84 coordinate system. Next, these real
data were used to create reference surfaces (using the proce-
dure described above). These surfaces differ significantly in
their shapes (see Fig. 2):

¢ Gate—trough surface with many holes and slopes,
¢ Swing—varied surface, partly flat, partly rough,
¢ Wrecks—almost flat surface with few car wrecks.

For each of these surfaces, a reference grid model was built
(using IDW, kriging and the moving average interpolation
method and then averaging). Their sizes and properties are
presented in Table 1.

Testing procedure

The research used the GIS SURFER v8.0 software package
(Golden Software, Golden-Colorado, USA). The IDW inter-
polation parameters such as search area, number of points,

power factor, and additional surface smoothing were modified
during the research. All the created surfaces (DTMs) were
compared with the reference surface, and the 95% confidence
level of error was determined (in centimetres), as well as the
computation time (in seconds).

All the calculations were performed on a personal comput-
er equipped with an Intel Core 17 processor (2.93 GHz, model
870), 4-GB RAM, HDD 2TB (ST32000641AS) and 64-bit
Windows 7. The performance index for this configuration,
calculated in Cinebench R15 (the CPU Test) (Cinebench
2020), is equal to 478 points.

Results

The first part of the study examined the impact of the size of
the adopted search radius on the accuracy of the model. This
parameter also indirectly affected the number of points in-
volved in interpolation, and the maximum number was limited
to 128. Tests were carried out for search radii equal to 0.2, 0.3,
0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 (meters). The value of
the minimum required points inside the search radius was set

to 4. If there were fewer points in the specified environment, a
blank node was inserted. The results obtained are presented in
Figs. 3, 4 and 5 (the error depends on the search radius, % of
blank nodes and calculation time).

As can be seen (Fig. 3, gate surface), the model error in the
initial phase slightly decreases (up to 3.3 cm) and then starts to
increase quickly (up to 9.5 cm). The percentage of blanked
nodes drops rapidly from 8 to 0%. Because our goal was the
minimal value at the 95% confidence level with a minimum of
blank nodes, the chosen optimum value of the search radius is
approximately 0.4 to 0.8 m.

Figure 4 (swing surface) shows that the 95% confidence
level of the error rate remains constant at approximately 5 cm.
The percentage of blanked nodes falls rapidly between 0.2 and
0.4 m. The value of the optimal search radius for this surface is
in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 m.

Figure 5 (wrecks surface) shows that the 95% confidence
level of the error rate increases slowly from 8 to 13 cm.
Because the density of the measurement data for this surface
is twice as high, for all the values, the search radius is 0%.
Consequently, the optimal search radius for this surface is low
(0.2 m or 0.3 m).

search radius [m]

 

Considering the results obtained for all three surfaces, it is
easy to notice that the accuracy of the created model is the
highest for low values of search radius (approximately 0.4—
0.6 m). On the other hand, for the smallest radius values, the
number of blank nodes may be too high for the created model
to be accepted. In conclusion, the optimal result for the search
radius is equal to 0.6 m (high model accuracy in the absence
of blank nodes).

The total interpolation time (green bars in the chart above)
is strongly dependent on the size of the adopted search radius
and increases exponentially with its size. It is particularly no-
table that the value of the radius chosen is larger than 2 m.
Appropriate selection of this parameter turns out to be crucial
in accelerating the IDW method.

The next part of the study examined the impact on the
accuracy and speed of model creation on the number of points
(n) involved in IDW interpolation. The tests were carried out
forn=1,2,3,4,5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20 and 50 points. In this phase
of research, it was additionally assumed that the maximum
search radius was 2.0 m.

Based on the results obtained (Fig. 6), it can be con-
cluded that the accuracy of the model is the highest when

approximately 6—10 nearest measuring points are involved
in the interpolation. The obtained model errors in these
cases are smaller than when all the points located in a
specific search for interpolation are taken by several per-
cent. The calculation time for this approach is quite short
and does not significantly depend on the density of the
measuring points.

As mentioned in the “Introduction”, when using the IDW
method, it is usually assumed that the value of the power
parameter is 2. However, this is not obligatory, and this pa-
rameter can take any real values. By changing this value, we
can determine how strong the influence of the points closer or
farther away from this value is when calculating a new value,
indirectly affecting the local sharpening or smoothing of the
surface. In the next stage of research, we checked the effect of
the power parameter on the accuracy and speed of interpola-
tion. The tests were carried out for power = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1,
1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 3 and 5. In these studies, search radius-
= (0.5 m and number of points n = 6 were used. The obtained
results are presented in Fig. 7.

Based on the results obtained, it can be clearly seen
that the highest accuracy of the model is obtained for

are almost the same for these values. The value of the
power parameter has no significant effect on the total

sumed that power =2 is the optimal value.

Proposition of improved variant of IDW—growing
radius

From the previous research, it can be concluded that the
method of selecting points involved in interpolation has
an impact on the accuracy of the created models and the
speed of calculations. The commonly used approach in
which a new value in a grid is calculated based on all
the points located within a specific environment (search
radius) is not optimal. Slightly better results are obtained
when vn nearest points are chosen for interpolation.
However, it should be remembered that the specificity
and standards associated with hydrographic works require
that the new value be calculated based on the points lying
not more than 1 m distance away.

Taking these dependencies into account, the author pro-
posed a new approach to the IDW interpolation method,
consisting of the abandonment of a fixed-size search
radius in favour of a growing radius. In the proposed

approach, the size of the interpolation window increases
from 3 x3 points until the required number of measuring
points (P) is within the radius or until the specified limit
value (maximum radius) is reached. Only the P nearest
points (this value is determined by the operator) located
within such a frame are involved in interpolation. If there
are no measuring points in the maximum radius, a blank
node is inserted.

The algorithm of the improved IDW variant begins with
the declaration of:

¢ Minimum number of points used for calculations P,
e Start radius R (default= 3),
e Maximum radius Ryyay.

Consequently, the points inside the search area are
ordered according to the squared radius (see Fig. 8a).
Next, the closest P points inside the search area deter-
mined by radius R are chosen (see Fig. 8b). If the num-
ber of points is greater than or equal to P, we perform
IDW interpolation by use of P nearest points. Otherwise,
we enlarge the R as long asR< = Rya,y or the number of
points required is greater or equal P We perform IDW
interpolation by use of these points (see Fig. 8c); other-
wise, we set a blank node.

Tests of the improved IDW method

Table 2 presents the results obtained when creating test models
using the author’s growing radius algorithm. The obtained
model accuracy and calculation times are compared with the
best values obtained before. The series of modified interpola-
tion tests were performed with the following parameters: P = 5,
8 or 10 points, Raga =3 x 3 points, Rayjay= 10 x 10 points (ad-
equate ‘search radius’ =1 m) and Rs7gp= 1 point. The results
with italicized values indicate the best results.
Based on the results, it can be concluded that:

¢ the Best results (the smallest error) are obtained when the
closest 5 points are taken for interpolation,

¢ The dimensions of the window (growing radius) for which
the best results are obtained is approximately 0.5—0.6 m,

¢ The depth accuracy in the created models (using the
improved variant of IDW) is higher by approximately
0.1 cm (3%),

slower the algorithm is—these differences are clearly no-
ticeable when using the algorithm with a fixed search
radius (exponential increase in computation time), and
when using the growing radius method, the increase in
calculation time is much slower and more linear, and

¢ The feature of the growing radius method means that in
practice, no blank nodes are created.

It should be noted that utilizing the new proposed interpo-
lation method only slightly increases the accuracy of the cre-
ated models but clearly speeds the interpolation process in
comparison to the traditional method (fixed search radius).
When using the growing radius method, the size of the frame
adapts to the density of the measurement points (which can
vary not only for data coming from different surveys but also
within the process of creating a model of one surface). In the

proposed method, it is the user (operator) who decides how
many points are considered while calculating a new node. The
use of a growing radius additionally results in a much smaller
number of blank nodes appearing.

In summary, the use of the modified IDW method in
creating the models of the seabed based on the data from
MBES allows for a significant reduction in the calculation
time with an additional minimal increase in the accuracy of
the created model.

Smoothing the surface

Because MBES source data have some random error, the
model created on this basis is characterized by minor local
disturbances. Although the process of data interpolation to a
grid by its nature slightly smooths the created surface, the use
of an additional smoothing algorithm can positively affect the
accuracy of the created model. Therefore, in the last part of the
research, the use of a smooth filter was considered an objec-
tive of analysis.

In the research, it was decided to focus on four local
smoothing methods:

¢ Gaussian filter with mask 3 x 3,
¢ 5-node + averaging 3 x 3,

¢ Median filter 3 x 3,

¢ Median filter 5 x 5.

The tests were performed using the growing radius meth-
od, and the results are presented in Table 3.

Based on the results obtained, it is clear that the use of
an additional smoothing filter increases the accuracy of the
model by approx. 0.3—1.0 cm, while the calculation time

increases by approx. 3-5%. The best results are obtained
using the Gaussian filter. The use of an additional model
smoothing filter slightly increases its accuracy but also
locally averages the measurements, so its use should be
an option for the system operator to choose. Figure 9
shows a fragment of the gate surface before and after ap-
plying the smoothing filter.

Discussion and conclusions

This paper presents research on IDW variants in the case of
digital terrain model creation using bathymetric data from
MBES. Because the method was tested on various shaped
surfaces and the test data reflected a real sea survey with high
accuracy, the test results can be considered reliable. The IDW
variant proposed by the author, a new method of a growing
radius with an optimal number of points required as well as
application of a Gaussian smoothing, was classified as the best
IDW variant (called modified IDW).

Based on the broader research conducted by the author
(presented in (Maleika et al. 2012) (Maleika 2018) (Maleika
2015) (Forezmanski and Maleika 2015) (Maleika et al. n.d.)),
the following can be seen:

¢ Increasing the search radius above | m results in slightly
larger errors with very long calculation times because the
density of measurement data from MBES 1s very high and
reaches up to 60 points per 1 m? of surface,

¢ Considering too many measuring points during interpola-
tion increases the model error and significantly increases
the calculation time,

e The best results are obtained for approximately 5—8 mea-
suring points in the nearest neighbourhood (search radius
~0.6 m), and

¢ The modified IDW (with growing radius) method slightly
increases the accuracy of the model, with a significant
reduction in the computation time, which is a significant
disadvantage of regular IDW in typical settings.

Based on the above hypothesis, the IDW method can
be optimized by eliminating the fixed size of the “search
radius” and focusing instead on several closest measure-
ment points.

The experiments showed the true potential of the new
modified method. Moreover, this method performed
very well on all the tested surfaces with errors at a
95% confidence level of less than 4 cm for the gate,
5 cm for the swing and 10 cm for the wrecks surfaces.
According to the IHO standards, the total model error
for the test surfaces should not exceed 25 cm. For all
the tested surfaces, the error was significantly below
this value, which shows that the modified IDW method
can be used (following the IHO standards) for this type
of interpolation.

Comparing the results of the research to the author’s
earlier works related to the optimization of the kriging
(Maleika 2018) and moving average (Maleika 2015) inter-
polation methods in the process of creating the seabed
DTM, it can be concluded that the modified IDW method
gives intermediate results, both in terms of model accuracy
and calculation time. Using this method allows us to obtain
a Clearly smaller model error than using the moving aver-
age method, although the error is slightly worse than that
using the kriging method, while the calculation time is
much shorter than that using the kriging method, although
the calculation time is slightly longer than that using the
moving average method. According to the author, the IDW
method is the most comprehensive in bathymetric data
processing in creating seabed DTM models.

The modified IDW method highlighted in this article is
strongly connected with the characteristics, location and den-
sity of measuring points obtained from MBES made in shal-
low waters (5—20 m). The changes in data (data obtained from
other measuring equipment or from MBES but in deeper wa-
ters) can cause slightly different readings of the search radius
and number of points in interpolation. In such cases, we
should use the method described in this article. The method
uses a simple pinpoint set of optimal parameters for different
input data and then adjusts the IDW method. The method
using the growing radius seems to be universal and indepen-
dent of the characteristics of the input data.

The proposed IDW method improvement approach can be
used in GIS software for modelling surfaces based on large
amounts of measurement data.
