Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are fatal to immuno-suppressed individuals, but no effective anti-HAdV

: therapy is available. Here, we present a novel image-based high-throughput screening (HTS) platform,
- which scores the full viral replication cycle from virus entry to dissemination of progeny and second-round

infections. We analysed 1,280 small molecular weight compounds of the Prestwick Chemical Library
(PCL) for interference with HAdV-C2 infection in a quadruplicate, blinded format, and performed robust
image analyses and hit filtering. We present the entire set of the screening data including all images,
image analyses and data processing pipelines. The data are made available at the Image Data Resource
(IDR, idr0081). Our screen identified Nelfinavir mesylate as an inhibitor of HAdV-C2 multi-round plaque

: formation, but not single round infection. Nelfinavir has been FDA-approved for anti-retroviral therapy

in humans. Our results underscore the power of image-based full cycle infection assays in identifying viral
inhibitors with clinical potential.

Background & Summary
Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) affect the respiratory, urinary and gastrointestinal tracts and the eyes. They cause

: morbidity and mortality, especially to immuno-compromised patients!” as indicated by a recent outbreak in
: the USA killing 12 children, or a recent case of meningoencephalitis in a middle-aged woman in the USA’.
: HAdVs have a high prevalence*” and are broadly used as gene therapy and vaccination vectors as well as onco-
: lytic viruses*"'°. The high seroprevalence of HAdV-C2 and C5 (species C, types 2 and 5) underlines that HAdV

infections are asymptomatic in healthy individuals, but persist in mucosal lymphocytes, and thereby pose a risk

: for immunosuppressed patients undergoing stem cell transplantation!'!’. More than 100 HAdV genotypes are
Pp Pp going Pp genotyp
: grouped into seven species based on hemagglutination assays and genome sequences'*"*. Types of the species A,

the eyes. Notably, species B members have a broad tropism, including kidney and hematopoietic cells

F and G replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, B, C and E in the respiratory tract, and B and D in the conjunctiva of

HAdV has a double-stranded DNA genome of ~36 kbp tightly packaged into an icosahedral protein capsid

: of about 90 nm in diameter’>'®. HAdV-C2 and C5 enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, shed minor

capsid proteins, expose the membrane lytic protein, penetrate the endosomal membrane and are transported to

: the nuclear membrane, where they uncoat and release their genome to the nucleus!”-”°. In the nucleus, the viral

genome gives rise to the immediate early viral mRNA encoding the E1A protein, which transactivates the subviral

: promoters, drives lytic infection and maintains genome persistence in presence of interferon”!~*’. Proteolytically

: matured HAdV progeny is released upon rupture of the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane

Currently, there is no effective therapy available against HAdV disease. The standard of care is the nucleoside
analogue Cidofovir, with poor clinical efficacy®’’. The problem is exacerbated by the shortage of a suitable small

: animal model for HAdV disease, although Syrian Hamsters are susceptible to HAdV-C infection and give rise to

viral progeny’®. Here, we developed an image-based procedure to identify novel inhibitors of HAdV infection in
cell culture. We used the commercially available Prestwick Chemical Library (PCL) comprising 1,280 off-patent
mostly FDA-approved small molecules (listed in PCL compounds tested in the screening procedure’’). The PCL
comprises compounds against diseases including infection and cancer*”’, collected at prestwickchemical.com/
libraries-publications.

We performed a phenotypic screen against HAdV-C2 infection employing automated fluorescence micros-
copy and image-based scoring of the progression of multi-round infections using the Plaque2.0 software°’
(Fig. la,b). For representative images in 384 well plates, see Fig. 1c. The procedure features robust imaging, image
analysis and data processing, as concluded from two parallel workflows carried out at independent institutions,
the Department of Molecular Life Sciences at University of Zurich (UZH), and the Biomolecular Screening
Facility at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

Five phenotypic features scored the effects of the compounds on HAdV-C2-dE3B-GFP-infected human lung
cancer epithelial A549 cells - the number of infected and uninfected cell nuclei, the infection index (infected
nuclei per total nuclei), the number of plaques (areas of infection foci originating from a single productively
infected cell as in non-perturbed infections depicted in Fig. 1d, left image) and the integrated signal of the infec-
tion marker green fluorescence protein (GFP) encoded in the reporter virus genome. All data are available at the
Image Data Resource (IDR, idr.openmicroscopy.org), IDR accession number idr0081°°, and can be accessed via
the IDR web client. Raw and scored infection phenotypes are provided for UZH and EPFL analyses. Rigorous
assay development ensured a high data quality, as indicated by mean Z’-factors of 0.52 for the plaque numbers.
The screening was performed in four biological replicates at high reproducibility. Compounds that gave signifi-
cant toxicity in uninfected cells were excluded during hit filtering.

Imaging, image analysis and scoring by the two independent teams yielded well correlated data and a congru-
ent list of top hits, provided in Table 1. We identified Nelfinavir mesylate (Nelfinavir in short) as best inhibitor
of HAdV infection. As evident in representative images presented in Fig. 1d, Nelfinavir abolishes the formation
of plaques, but not single first round infections. We confirmed the antiviral efficacy of Nelfinavir in a follow-up
study**.

Methods

Virus. _HAdV-C2-dE3B-GFP was produced as described” and fully sequenced’. In brief, the virus was gen-
erated by exchange of the viral E3B genome region with a reporter cassette harbouring the enhanced green fluo-
rescent protein (GFP) under the immediate early Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter”. The virus was grown in
A549 cells and purified by double caesium chloride gradient centrifugation*®. Aliquots supplemented with 10%
glycerol (v/v) were stored at —80°C. HAdV-C2-dE3B-GFP was found to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and
negative-stain analyses by transmission electron microscopy.

Cell culture. A549 (human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelium) cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, USA. The cells were maintained in full medium: high
glucose Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) containing 7.5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and 1%
penicillin streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and subcultured following PBS washing and trypsinisa-
tion (Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) weekly. Cells were grown at standard conditions (37 °C, 5%
CO,, 95% humidity) and passage number kept below 20.

Preparation of pre-plates. Ten ul 0.0125% DMSO in PBS was spotted on all 384 wells each of
imaging-compatible 384-well plates (Matrix plates #4332, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) using
a Matrix WellMate dispenser and normal bore Matrix WellMate tubing cartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, USA). Plates were sealed and stored at —20°C.

Blinding. The PCL compound arrangement as dispensed by EPFL in four subset plates A - D comprising each
screening set replicate 1-4 was blinded and replaced by UZH with internal identifier (Raw Plaque-2.0 infection
scores of the PCL screen, imaged and analysed at UZH and Processed Plaque-2.0 infection scores of the PCL
screen, imaged and analysed at UZH”, compoundIdentifier 1 to 1280). The identity of the compounds was only
disclosed after the screening process and hit filtering (Raw Plaque-2.0 infection scores of the PCL screen, imaged
and analysed at UZH and Processed Plaque-2.0 infection scores of the PCL screen, imaged and analysed at UZH”’
and Table 1, PCL_ID Prestw-1 to Prestw-1804 and compoundName).

Compounds. The PCL was obtained from Prestwick Chemical (Ilkirch, France). 3’-deoxy-3’-fluorothymidine
(DFT, CAS number 25526-93-6) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemical, North York, Canada. All com-
pounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) at a final stock concentra-
tion of 10mM and stored at —20°C.

PrestoBlue toxicity assay. Toxicity of the PCL compounds on uninfected A549 cells was assessed using the
PrestoBlue Cell Viability reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). PrestoBlue*””® is a cell viability and
cytotoxicity indicator based on resazurin. Resazurin is reduced to resorufin in cellular respiration by accepting
electrons from NAPDH, FADH, FMNH, NADH and cytochromes. This reduction causes PrestoBlue to change
from a non-fluorescent to a strongly fluorescent form. The conversion of PrestoBlue is proportional to the number
of metabolically active cells and can be evaluated quantitatively using fluorescence or absorbance measurements.
Briefly, following 3.5-day continuous treatment of A549 cells with compounds at concentrations and cell densities
as in the screening protocol, 10% final PrestoBlue was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at standard cell
incubation conditions. Fluorescence intensity (bottom-read) was measured using a multi-well plate reader (Tecan

and 4,000 A549 cells/wells seeded. The following day, the cells were inoculated with HAdV-C2-dE3B at 1.77*10°
genome equivalents/well. Allowing for multiple viral replication rounds, the cells were PFA-fixed at 72 hpi and
the nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342. The infection phenotypes were imaged using an epifluorescence HT
microscope and scored using Plaque2.0. The data of the four technical replicates were further processed in R

Table 1. Summary of screening controls and top hits. Mean corresponds to the means over four biological
replicates of PCL compound and 16 biological replicates each carrying 32 technical replicates for each control.
Neg. ctr. refers to solvent control (DMSO), pos. ctr. to DFT-treated wells. Normalized indicates the mean read-
outs of each compound relative to the mean of the positive control over all replicates. Toxicity was accessed by
PrestoBlue assay of 3.5-day treatment of uninfected A549 cells as well as by the nuclei Z’-factor in the screen.
Hits were selected for low toxicity and high inhibitory effects compared to solvent control samples. Note that
compounds were scored toxic, if they showed significant toxicity in either of the assays.

Infinite F500, Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) with excitation at 560/10 nm, emission at 590/10 nm at a fixed gain.
Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Prestw-438, Prestwick Chemical, Illkirch, France) was used as a positive control for
cytotoxicity, at a final concentration of 10 uM, and the corresponding concentration of the drug solvent DMSO
was used as a negative control. The full PCL library was tested on duplicated plates. The EPFL-BSF in-house
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) was used for data processing and statistical validation. First,
raw PrestoBlue readings were normalized per plate to negative control values at 0 and positive controls at 1. Then,
the normalized values of both duplicates were averaged. Assay quality was assessed for each plate through the
Z’-factor calculation. Compounds were considered toxic, when the normalized value for all replicates was higher
than the average + 30 (standard deviation, SD) of the DMSO negative control for the corresponding plate. Scores
and score SD were then calculated for hit compounds by averaging normalized value for all replicates.

Preparation of plates for Z'-factor and drugscreening. Ten nl of 10mM PCL compounds, the nucleo-
side analogue DFT positive control (all dissolved in DMSO) and DMSO only as negative control were pre-spotted
on imaging-compatible 384-well plates (Falcon plates, Corning Inc., New York, USA) using an Echo acoustic
liquid handling system (Labcyte, San Jose, USA) by the EPFL-BSF, sealed and stored at —20°C. Each Z’-factor
384-well plate consisted of 192 technical replicates of positive and negative controls, each. Each screening plate
set consisted of four subset plates A to D. Each screening plate comprised 32 technical replicates of positive and
negative controls, each, and 320 PCL compounds.

Wet-lab screening pipeline. The screening was performed in four independent biological replicates
1-4. Liquid handling was performed using a Matrix WellMate dispenser and Matrix WellMate tubing car-
tridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Prior to usage, tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved
double-distilled (dd) H,O followed by 125 ml autoclaved PBS. Pre-spotted compound plates were thawed at
room temperature (RT) for 30 min, briefly centrifuged before compounds were dissolved in 10 pl/well of PBS.
4,000 A549 cells/well in 60 ul full medium were seeded onto the compounds using standard bore tubing car-
tridges. Following cell adhesion over night, the cells were inoculated with 1.77*10° genome equivalents per
well of HAdV-C2-dE3B-GFP in 10 ul of full medium using bovine serum albumin (BSA, cell-culture grade,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)-blocked small bore tubing cartridges. The final compound concentration was
1.25uM at 0.0125% DMSO. Infection was allowed to progress over multiple infection rounds for 72h giving rise
to foci of infected cells originating from a single first round infected cell. Cells were fixed for 1h at RT by addition
of 26.6 UL 16% PFA and 4ug/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in PBS using standard bore
tubing cartridges. Cells were washed three times with PBS before PBS supplemented with 0.02% N; was added
and plates were sealed for long-term storage at 4°C. Following usage, tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved
ddH,0 followed by 125 ml autoclaved PBS and autoclaved for re-usage.

Imaging. Nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342 (DAPI channel) and viral GFP (FITC channel) were imaged on
two devices. At UZH, plates were imaged on an IXM-C automated high-throughput fluorescence microscope
(Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) using MetaXpress (version 6.2, Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) and a
4x air objective (Nikon S Fluor, 0.20 NA, 15.5mm WD, Nikon Instruments, Minato, Japan) at widefield mode.
Images of 2,048 px at 1.72 um/px resolution were acquired on an Andor sCMOS camera (Oxford Instruments,
Abingdon, UK). Exposure times: DAPI 150 ms, FITC 20 ms. At EPFL, images were acquired on a IN Cell 2200
automated high-throughput fluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA) using IN Cell Analyzer
(version 6.2, GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA) and a 4x air objective (Nikon Plan Apo, 0.20 NA, 15.7 mm WD,
Nikon Instruments, Minato, Japan) at widefield mode. Image size 2,048? px at 1.625 um/px resolution acquired
on an Andor sCMOS camera. Exposure times: DAPI 300 ms, FITC 40 ms.

Image analysis. The infection phenotype for each well was quantified by Plaque2.0°* (https://github.com/
plaque2/matlab/tree/antivir) via five main read-outs: number of nuclei, number of infected nuclei, the ratio
between infected and total nuclei referred to as infection index, number of multi-round infection foci termed
plaques (plaque forming unit(s), pfu) and the integrated viral transgenic GFP intensity. Plaque2.0 parameters
were optimized independently at UZH and EPFL for the data acquired at the respective institution. Well- and
object-based read-outs are provided in the Plaque2.0 output files.

Table 2. Z’-factor plates. The quality of the platform was assessed prior to screening of the PCL by two
independent Z’-factor plates containing 192 technical replicates of both positive control (1.25 uM DFT) and
solvent only control (0.0125% DMSO). Z’-factors for the five Plaque2.0 read-outs*” obtained by independent
analysis at UZH and EPFL were calculated according to Eq. (1) for 3 and 20.

Z'-factor calculation. The Z’-factor was computed using R version 3.3.2*° according to Eq. (1)

ro (30, + 30_)
a — (1)

where ©, is the SD of the positive control, o_ is the SD of the negative control, 1. the mean of the positive control
and \1. the mean of the negative control.

Screening data processing. Plaque2.0 results were further processed and filtered. At UZH, results were
processed in R version 3.3.2°’, EPFL used KNIME version 3.4.0 as well as the EPFL-BSF in-house LIMS. Mean
infection scores over the five Plaque2.0 read-outs of the four biological replicates of each PCL compound and the
16 biological replicates containing 32 technical replicates of positive and negative control, each, were calculated.
Each compound's scores were normalized by the mean score of the DMSO negative control of the respective
plate. Only non-toxic, effective PCL compounds were considered as HAdV inhibitor candidates. Non-toxic com-
pounds were filtered by applying an inclusive 1, (mean of the negative control) + 20 (SD of the negative control)
threshold for number of nuclei. Efficacy was filtered by applying an excluding 1, + 30 threshold for the infection
scores (number of infected nuclei, infection index, number of plaques or integrated GFP intensity). Subsequently,
compounds exhibiting significant toxicity to noninfected cells were excluded.

Data Records

Data structure and repositories. The screening data comprise the information collected during assay
development, including stability, quality and screening of the PCL itself. The latter two were imaged on two
different microscopes. We provide the parameters used for Plaque2.0 image analysis, and the code for the subse-
quent hit filtering in R. The data available for download at the IDR, accession number idr0081°°, are structured as
outlined in Fig. 2a. For download instructions, see idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/download. Moreover, the data
can be viewed conveniently on the IDR web client (idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient), where it is structured as

Table 3. Z’-factors of screening plates. The quality of the screening data was assessed for each screening plate
based on the 32 technical replicates of both positive control (1.25 uM DFT) and solvent only control (0.0125%
DMSO) in each plate. Z’-factors for the five Plaque2.0 read-outs*’ obtained by independent analysis at UZH and
EPFL were calculated according to Eq. (1) for 30.

Technical Validation

Assay stability. The wet-lab screening pipeline was optimized regarding liquid handling, cell seeding, virus
inoculum, positive and negative controls, infection time, as well as imaging and image analysis. This ensured a
high assay stability and reproducibility. Furthermore, all compounds, especially media and supplements, the BSA
for tubing saturation, PFA- and Hoechst-supplemented fixative were prepared as large batch from a single lot and
stored as single-use aliquots. Prior to every experiment, assay stability with respect to cell and infection pheno-
type was tested on pre-plates according to the established wet-lab, imaging and image analysis pipeline. Since the
solvent control had already been spotted in 10 ul PBS, no further PBS was added prior to cell seeding. Periodically,
the virus stock dilution was tested and adjusted for experiments if necessary.

Assay quality determination: Z’-factor. The accuracy of the wet-lab, imaging and image analysis pipe-
line was assessed by two independently imaged and analysed Z’-factor plates (Table 2 and Fig. 3). 30 Z’-factors of
numberOfInfectedNuclei, infectionIndex and numberOfPlaques were in the range of 0.30 to 0.57, scoring good to
excellent. total VirusIntensity (Z’-factors between —0.07 to 0.08) were not suitable to identify HAdV infection inhib-
itors, while numberOfNuclei (Z’-factors between — 1.11 to —8.10) was not a useable readout either. Additionally,
the Z’-factors were determined for each of the 16 screening plates (Table 3 and Fig. 4). 30 Z’-factors of numberOf-
InfectedNuclei, infectionIndex and numberOfPlaques were in the range of 0.27 to 0.57, scoring good to excellent.

Independent analysis and filtering. Imaging, image analysis and screening data processing were per-
formed by two independent research teams at UZH and EPFL, as depicted in Fig. 1. Raw and scored infection
phenotypes are shown for UZH and EPFL analyses (Raw Plaque-2.0 infection scores of the PCL screen, imaged
and analysed at UZH, Processed Plaque-2.0 infection scores of the PCL screen, imaged and analysed at UZH and
Raw Plaque-2.0 infection scores of the PCL screen, imaged and analysed at EPFL, Processed Plaque-2.0 infection
scores of the PCL screen, imaged and analysed at EPFL, respectively”’). Both dry-lab pipelines confirmed the
high assay quality (Tables 2 and 3). During hit filtering, PCL compounds that gave significant toxicity in unin-
fected cells were excluded during hit filtering (Fig. 5, PCL compounds excluded due to toxicity in uninfected
cells’). As summarized in Fig. 6 left panel, both scores are strongly correlated with R* between 0.6870 and 0.9870.
Both approaches yielded identical top scored compounds (Fig. 6, right panel), of which Prestw-1764, Nelfinavir
mesylate, was the top hit.

Usage Notes

Five parameters were used to score the infection phenotype of each well: the number of nuclei (numberOfNuclei),
number of infected nuclei (numberOfInfectedNuclei), the ratio between number of infected and total nuclei (infec-
tionIndex), the number of multi-round infection foci termed plaques (numberOfPlaques) and the extend of viral
GFP reporter expression as integrated GFP intensity total VirusIntensity).

Fig. 5 PCL compound toxicity in uninfected cells. Of the 1,278 PCL compounds tested, 126 PCL compounds
are found to be toxic, as shown in red, and listed in PCL compounds excluded due to toxicity in uninfected
cells”. A549 cells were treated with PCL compounds in duplicates according to the screening wet-lab protocol,
however, in absence of HAdV infection for 3.5 days. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Prestw-438) was used as

a positive control for cytotoxicity, at a final concentration of 10 uM, and the corresponding concentration of
the drug solvent DMSO was used as a negative control. Cell viability was determined by PrestoBlue assay.
PrestoBlue fluorescence intensities of each well were normalized per plate to negative control values at 0 and
positive controls at 1. Compounds were considered toxic, when the normalized value for all replicates was
higher than the average +30 (standard deviation, SD) of the DMSO negative control for the corresponding
plate. X-axis indicates compounds by their PCL identifier (PCL ID, see PCL compounds tested in the screening
procedure’). Normalized average PrestoBlue read-outs are depicted on the y-axis.
