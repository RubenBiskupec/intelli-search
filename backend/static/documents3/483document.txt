Centro Hospitalar do Porto, mended by the drug package inserts. Identifying precisely the moment of loss of
4000001 Porta Portugal responsiveness will determine the amount of propofol each patient needs. Currently,
Full list of author information methods to decide the exact moment of loss of responsiveness are based on subjec-

is available at the end of the tive analysis, and the monitors that use objective methods fail in precision. Based on
article previous studies, we believe that the blink reflex can be useful to characterize, more

objectively, the transition from responsiveness to unresponsiveness. The purpose of
this study is to investigate the relation between the electrically evoked blink reflex
and the level of sedation/anesthesia measured with an adapted version of the Rich-
mond Agitation-Sedation Scale, during the induction phase of general anesthesia
with propofol and remifentanil. Adding the blink reflex to other variables may allow a
more objective assessment of the exact moment of loss of responsiveness and a more

personalized approach to anesthesia induction.

Results: The electromyographic-derived features proved to be good predictors to
estimate the different levels of sedation/anesthesia. The results of the multinomial
analysis showed a reasonable performance of the model, explaining almost 70% of the
adapted Richmond Agitation—Sedation Scale variance. The overall predictive accuracy
for the model was 73.6%, suggesting that it is useful to predict loss of responsiveness.

Conclusions: Our developed model was based on the information of the electromy-
ographic-derived features from the blink reflex responses. It was able to predict the
drug effect in patients undergoing general anesthesia, which can be helpful for the
anesthesiologists to reduce the overwhelming variability observed between patients
and avoid many cases of overdosing and associated risks. Despite this, future research
is needed to account for variabilities in the clinical response of the patients and with
the interactions between propofol and remifentanil. Nevertheless, a method that could
allow for an automatic prediction/detection of loss of responsiveness is a step forward
for personalized medicine.

Background

In clinical practice, anesthesiologists use a variety of anesthetic drugs during surgery
to render the patient unconscious/unresponsive, including the most widely used,
intravenous drug propofol. In a previously published work [1,2], we found that the
amount of propofol needed to induce loss of responsiveness (LORP) varied widely
among patients (~ 300%) and that more than two-thirds of the patients required less
than the initial dose recommended by the drug package inserts.

Identifying precisely the moment of LORP during the induction phase of general
anesthesia is of extreme importance for the determination of the amount of propofol
each patient needs. Using that information will help to guide the drug infusion rate
required to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia throughout the surgery [3-5].

Currently, methods to decide the exact moment of LORP are based on subjective
analysis [6]. Objectively, there are depth of anesthesia monitors, such as the Bispec-
tral Index (BIS) (Aspect Medical System, Newton, MA, USA), which allow the main-
tenance of a steady-state during surgery, but do not enable the determination of the
instant at LORP, which remains an open issue. BIS evaluation is characterized by a
delay following the acquisition of a new dataset, which may even exceed one minute
[7]. To prevent complications, such as awareness [8, 9] or excessive anesthesia, the
anesthesiologists should be aware of the conditions that cause incorrect BIS readings.

In a previous study, Mourisse et al. [10] found that the components of the blink
reflex are attenuated and abolished with increasing concentrations of propofol. Mour-
isse et al. [11] showed, in another study that the blink reflex was more sensitive than
BIS. Their results suggested that the differential sensitivity of the blink reflex compo-
nents could be useful to monitor the depth of sedation/anesthesia, and thus, to detect
when LORP occurs. However, their method used a 10-min stepwise increment in
propofol, which is not compatible with anesthesia induction in a surgical setup.

We hypothesize that the blink reflex can be useful to characterize, more objec-
tively, the transition from responsiveness to unresponsiveness during the induction
of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The administration of propofol may be
stopped at this transition, personalizing the amount of propofol each patient requires
and reducing the events of over and underdosing. Then, this can be used to titrate
the infusion rate of propofol and to maintain an adequate level of sedation/anesthe-
sia. In the current study, and based on a constant infusion of propofol at a slow rate,
we intend to investigate the relationship between the electrically evoked blink reflex
and the level of sedation/anesthesia. For this purpose, we extracted different electro-
myogram (EMG) features, and we compared the ability of these features to distin-
guish between different levels of sedation/anesthesia. The comparison was carried out
using prediction probability analysis and multinomial logistic modeling. Adding the
blink reflex to other variables already recorded during general anesthesia may allow
a more objective assessment of the exact moment of LORP and a more personalized

approach to anesthesia induction.

Results

Twenty-five patients (16 female and 9 male), aged 61413, weighing 72+11 kg,
heighten 162+9 cm, 1 ASA I, 18 ASA II, 6 ASA III were enrolled. The supraorbital
nerve was stimulated with 25.7+8 mA. All patients reached the end of the depth of
sedation/anesthesia scale. No patient had hemodynamic or respiratory problems.

Visual inspection of the raw electromyogram and analysis of the signal quality was
performed before extracting the features to eventually discard poor-quality electro-
myogram. No signal was discarded.

The raw data from the study are presented in Fig. 1; each patient’s observed adapted
Richmond Agitation—Sedation Scale (aRASS) scores are plotted against the corre-
sponding predicted propofol effect-site concentrations.

Concerning the raw electromyographic findings, after the propofol infusion was
started, R, and R, decreased gradually. Ce concentrations, aRASS values, and times at
which LOR,, LOR, and LORP occurred are presented in Table 1. R, was the first com-
ponent to be abolished, followed by the R, component. aRASS median [minimum,
maximum] for LOR, was 0 [0, — 2] and for LOR, was — 2 [0, — 4]. All patients were
responsive (aRASS<— 5) when the R, and R, responses were last seen. There was
a Statistically significant difference between the propofol Ce concentration at LORP
and LOR, (p<0.05). The times for endpoints LOR,, LOR, and LORP are all statisti-
cally different from each other (p< 0.001).

The time between LORP and LOR, was 35.68 + 23.41 s. The amount of propofol given
between LOR, and LORP was 1.23 £0.82 ug/mL.
Results of the features extracted from the EMG signals in the time and frequency

domain are presented in Table 2.

Prediction probability and Spearman correlation coefficient

The capacity of all extracted features to adequately assess the clinical sedation/anesthetic
depth was evaluated by P, analyses. The user interface is shown in Fig. 2. The calculated
P, values and correlation coefficients of the electromyography (EMG) extracted features
are shown in Table 3. P, values were higher (P,>0.700) in the period T;, for Vineans Vaigs
Fmean’ median? bandwidth 2nd spectral entropy; and in the period T, for fia,» and spec-
tral entropy. Results indicated that during the period T, there was a significant nega-
tive association, defined by a correlation coefficient R higher than — 0.500 and a p<0.05,
between aRASS and firean Smedian’ and spectral entropy. During the period T, there was
a significant negative association between propofol Ce concentration and the following
features: foeany median’ and spectral entropy. There was no significant correlation between
aRASS and the extracted features, and no significant association between the Ce con-
centration of propofol and the extracted features.

The correlation between aRASS and the propofol Ce concentration was given by
P,=0.886, SE=0.007 and by R=0.751, p<0.01. The clinical scale of the depth of seda-
tion/anesthesia increased monotonically and positively with increasing propofol Ce con-
centration until LORP, revealing an increasing deepening of sedation/anesthesia.

Multinomial logistic analysis

Regarding MLR, we choose the features which were better correlated with the Ce con-
centration of propofol and with aRASS, and features which we believe were useful (with
a P,>0.700). The predictor features corresponding to these criteria were propofol Ce,
and V,

mean?

Vai Smear Jmedian’ Pbandwidth 2d spectral entropy, during the period T,, and
mean 2nd spectral entropy during the period T,

We tried to explore the effects of these variables by building the MLR model and then
examined the results. To achieve this goal, we used SPSS software version 26, and calcu-
lated the MLR model with response variable and all explanatory variables to make the

primary model.

The overall effectiveness of the model was assessed using Chi-squared statistics. The Chi-
square value of 696.430 and its respective p value <0.001 indicated a significant relationship
between the depth of sedation/anesthesia scale and the set of features in the final model.
Model performance (Nagelkerke R?) of the MLR for the combined features predicting
aRASS level of sedation/anesthesia groups was 0.697. The overall predictive accuracy for
the present model was 73.6%.

The likelihood ratio test shows the contribution of each feature to the model (Table 4).

Propofol Ce fnean (Tj), spectral entropy (T,), and spectral entropy (T,) had a significant
contribution (p<0.05) to the model that predicts the aRASS’s level of sedation/anesthesia,
but not Vinean (11), fmedian (11), Poanawiath (71) OF fmean (75). Figure 3 illustrates the relation
between the aRASS score and the mean of the significant aforementioned features.

Discussion

In the present study, a standard electrical stimulus to evoke a blink reflex was used dur-
ing the induction phase of general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil to assess
the relation between the recorded electromyogram and the level of sedation/anesthesia.
The level of sedation was assessed every 6 s using an adapted version of the Richmond
Agitation—Sedation Scale, entitled aRASS.

The electromyographic-derived features were extracted during 2 specific subsets of
samples: T, from 10 to 25 ms, in which it was expected the first response of the blink
reflex, R,, to be analyzed, and T\,, from 25 to 200 ms, in which the second response of the
blink reflex, Ry was expected to be analyzed. The electromyographic-derived features in
and the difference between the

maximum and the mean amplitude (Vj). Because R, and R, responses were abolished

the time domain included the mean amplitude (V,,..,))

before LORP and, consequently, there was an insufficient number of data points, a fre-
quency-domain analysis was also performed. The electromyographic-derived features in

the frequency domain included the mean power (P maximum power (P mean

mean)? max)?

frequency (fi.ecan)» power at mean frequency (P median frequency (fedian), band

selected as they are the most useful and popular frequency-domain features for electro-
myography analysis both in clinical and engineering applications.

The ability of the electromyographic-derived features to distinguish different levels
of aRASS was assessed using prediction probability analysis. Spectral entropy, firean
Fmedian 20d Pyandwidth during the T, time window period showed the best performance
in detecting different levels of aRASS, as reflected by its higher P, value, followed by
spectral entropy and f,,.,, during the T, time window period. A statistically significant
correlation (R>0.500) between aRASS (or propofol Ce concentration) and f,..a, (T),
Fmedian (2) and spectral entropy (T,) period was also found. At low anesthetic concen-
tration, the EMG frequency was high, and it slowed down as the drugs concentrations
increased. Spectral entropy considers both the overall signal variability characteris-
tics, which are naturally related to the spectral content, and the signal’s complexity or
irregularity [12]. For this reason, spectral entropy is known to be an excellent index to
distinguish between consciousness and unconsciousness states during propofol anes-
thesia, even in the presence of burst suppression [13]. f,,

and f,, are frequently

used as the gold standard tool to detect force in the target muscles using EMG signals
[14, 15]. Pranawidth 1S Supposed to be a good indicator of changes in the EMG signal
when certain frequencies are lost, as is the case of the R, and R, component of the
blink reflex, which have a particular signature. The effectiveness of spectral entropy,
Smean, Jmedian 29d Pyanawiath to distinguish the different levels of aRASS, resulted by the
inhibition of EMG activity by muscle relaxation, is presented and confirmed in this
study.

Another finding was that aRASS scale was strongly correlated with estimated propo-
fol Ce concentrations, indicating that the clinical scale aRASS increased monotonically
and positively with increasing estimated propofol Ce concentrations until LORP. This

revealed an increasing deepening of anesthesia. This finding is in line with those pub-
lished by Mourisse and colleagues [10, 11] who have done a similar study using a dif-
ferent sedation scale and a different anesthetic protocol. In the work of Mourisse and
colleagues, the group of patients received propofol in a stepwise deepening of anesthesia
with different targets and only 2 min after reaching target effect-site concentrations, the
blink reflexes, and depth of anesthesia scores were recorded. In our study, remifentanil
infusion started with a Ce concentration target 2.5 ug/mL, and then patients received
propofol at an infusion rate of 3.3 mL/kg/h, slowly and continuously, until LORP. Start-
ing before the propofol infusion, the stimulation of the supraorbital nerve was recorded
every 6s in our study and, for this reason, our method had more data to precisely iden-
tify the amount of propofol in the endpoints of interest.

Only the features that were both useful for predicting the aRASS scale (P, > 0.700) and
correlated significantly (R>0.500) with the propofol Ce concentration were used for the
multinomial logistic regression model to predict LORP (defined as — 5 in the aRASS
scale). The results of the multinomial analysis showed a reasonable performance of the
model, explaining almost 70% of the aRASS variance. The effects and contributions of
each feature were not the same: propofol Ce concentration, f,,.gia, (I), spectral entropy
during T,, and spectral entropy during T, had a significant overall effect (v< 0.05) on the
aRASS score, while Vijean (11); Anedian (11) and finean (7) did not. The overall predictive
accuracy for the model was 73.6%, suggesting that it is useful to predict LORP. The avail-
ability of accurate models for predicting the drug effect in patients undergoing general
anesthesia is an important factor in producing a personalized drug infusion [16]. Our
developed model can be employed in model predictive control strategies for closed-loop
anesthesia. This will help the anesthesiologists with the optimization of drug titration
without overshoot and controlling the physiological functions. This automated system
could also result in a reduction of the workload of the anesthesiologists.

A major drawback of this our blink reflex method is that it is dependent on a normal
neuromuscular transmission. The degree of relaxation can be estimated by stimulating
the facial nerve and assessing the evoked response of that part of the orbicularis oculi
muscle. The effect of muscle relaxants on the inferior part of the orbicularis oculi is still
not known. Also, the blink reflex method, while promising, may imply that the anesthe-
siologists are stimulating the patient while simultaneously attempting to induce uncon-
sciousness, even though it is a much smaller stimulation than taping (the standard in
clinical practice).

The multinomial regression model was applied to a small sample size of the uncon-
sciousness states in this study. In particular, the small number of unconsciousness states
could be the cause of a not so high performance in detecting LORP. Even so, the perfor-
mance of our model is relatively good and therefore, we intend to implement our model
for online estimation. However, preliminary studies should be conducted specially
because of the computerization times the model can result.

Conclusions
By analyzing the electrically evoked blink reflex during the induction of general anesthe-
sia with propofol and remifentanil, we determined that there is enough relevant informa-

tion to predict the state of unresponsiveness during the transition from consciousness
Ferreira et al. BioMed Eng OnLine (2020) 19:84 Page 10 of 16

to unconsciousness with a multinomial logistic model. A method that could allow for
an automatic prediction/detection of LORP is a step forward for personalized medicine.
With an accuracy of 73.6%, this model can help to greatly reduce the overwhelming vari-
ability observed between patients and avoid many cases of overdosing and associated
risks. To our best knowledge, no studies have been conducted on LORP prediction using
our approach.

Despite our results, it would be accurate if we had a larger sample size for applying
the multinomial regression model or any other prediction model to analyze the relation
between the aRASS and the EMG effect reflected in extracted features. Further research
should investigate the impact of remifentanil on such a technique.

Nevertheless, our method of electromyographic recording of the electrically evoked
blink reflex in patients submitted to general anesthesia and in the continuum to uncon-
sciousness showed to be a possible method to continuously monitor the EMG, in awake,
sedated or unconsciousness patients, during the onset to unconsciousness, and in a
real scenario in which clinical anesthesia takes place every day. Patients also found the
stimuli to be easily tolerable. Devices using this technique could turn this method into a
clinical routine way of monitoring the transition to unconsciousness.

In the future, we intend to add other variables to feed the model, such as heart rate,
blood pressure, and electroencephalogram. We plan to use those variables to build an
adaptive model that deals simultaneously with the variabilities in the clinical response of
the patients and with the drug interactions. Additionally, we plan to use different EMG

equipment for more robustness.

Methods

Patients

Twenty-five patients, aged over 18 years (ASA I, II or III), scheduled for neurosurgical
procedures participated in this study. They had no hemodynamic, respiratory or oph-
thalmic problems, and did not use analgesics, psychotropic or excessive alcohol con-
sumptions. The Hospital Ethical Committee approved the study and all subjects gave
informed written consent. No premedication was given. The study took place in a quiet,
warm anesthetic induction room. Before the start of the study, the patients were pre-
pared as usual for anesthesia (intravenous access, continuous electrocardiogram, pulse

oximetry, and non-invasive blood pressure).

Anesthetic protocol

Our standard practice for neurosurgical procedures consists of opioid-propofol anes-
thesia using a Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) system. In the operating room, after
placement of standard monitor and an intravenous line in the dorsum of the hand, an
infusion of a balanced electrolytic solution was started at 6 mL.kg~'.h~'. The anesthe-
siologist would then use a Fresenius Base Primea docking station (Fresenius-Kabi, Bad
Homburg, Germany) to start a TCI of remifentanil (Minto PKPD model) [12, 13], at an
effect-site concentration (Ce) target of 2.5 ng.mL~'. A bolus of 10 mg of lidocaine was
administered locally to reduce the pain associated with propofol administration. One

minute after the remifentanil pseudo-equilibration was achieved, baseline blinks were
Ferreira et al. BioMed Eng OnLine (2020) 19:84 Page 11 of 16

recorded and, then, an infusion of 1% propofol (Schnider PKPD model) [14] was started
using a TCI enabled infusion system, in the TCI-View mode, at 3.3 mL.Kg™'.h™! until
LORP, determined by the anesthesiologist. This slow velocity of infusion during induc-
tion enabled a careful titration of the minimum amount of propofol required for loss of
responsiveness. Once LORP was reached, the propofol infusion was stopped, the esti-
mated propofol Ce concentration was noted and the TCI system was switched to effect-
site TCI mode with a Ce of 75% of that at LORP. At this point, no additional analgesic/
opioid medication was given during induction.

Propofol infusion was subsequently titrated to maintain BIS (BIS Vista’ monitor—
Medtronic, Ireland) between 40 and 60. The study was terminated just before tracheal

intubation.

Data acquisition

Using the VikingQuest™ neurophysiological system (VikingQuest, Nicolet, WI, USA)
the electromyographic stimulations and recordings were performed at a total sweep
time of 200 ms with a sample rate of 10 kHz. A high-pass filter was applied with a cutoff
frequency of 20 Hz. Before the induction of anesthesia and prior electrode application,
all the patient’s head skin surfaces were cleaned with an exfoliant agent. Surface elec-
trodes (1.4 cm?) coated with alcohol and conductive paste (electrode impedance < 8 kQ)
were applied to stimulate and record the electromyogram from the right orbicularis
oculi muscle. The right supraorbital nerve was transcutaneously stimulated using a bipo-
lar electrode with the cathode placed beneath the eyebrow over the supraorbital notch
and the anode placed above the eyebrow (interelectrode distance 2 cm). The supraorbital
nerve was electrically stimulated with a duration of 0.1 ms at 0.16 Hz. With regard to
the electrode, the recording electrode was placed in the middle of the inferior rim of the
orbit; the reference halfway on the eye—ear line and the ground electrode was placed on
the cheek or on the shoulder of the patient (Fig. 4). The signals were stored in the Viking-
Quest’” software provided by the manufacturer. The raw data was exported to a personal
computer to be treated and analyzed in MATLAB® 2019b (MathWorks, USA).

Assessment of levels of responsiveness

The level of sedation was assessed every six seconds using an adapted version of the
Richmond Agitation—Sedation Scale (RASS) score [17], entitled aRASS. This scale is a
modification of the RASS scale [17], with the addition of the corneal reflex endpoint,
yielding an adapted Richmond Agitation—Sedation Scale (aRASS). A score of 0 corre-
sponds to a fully awake and alert behavior, — 1 with a not fully alert behavior, but a sus-
tained awakening to voice (eye-opening and eye contact), — 2 with a brief awakening
to voice (eye-opening and eye contact, — 3 no response to voice, but movement or eye-
opening to shaking and shouting, — 4 is no response after shaking and shouting, but
still have the corneal reflex and — 5 is no corneal reflex. Loss of responsiveness (LORP),
defined as — 5 in aRASS scale was evaluated using a drop of sterile water to the cor-
nea, after aRASS reached a score of — 4. Hereafter, this evaluation was intercalated with
electrical stimulations at 6 s intervals. If the eyes blinked concomitantly, the reflex was
intact. If only one eye blinked, the reflex was impaired, and if neither eye blinked, the
reflex was absent.

Baseline blink reflexes and evaluation of the aRASS scale were recorded several times
before propofol was administered. Patients then received propofol, and at the same time
four successive blink reflexes were elicited and recorded. A further four successive blink
reflex stimuli were elicited after a 6-s interval and recorded continuously until LORP

was reached.

Blink reflex parameters

The blink reflex neurophysiology and anatomy are reasonably well known [18]. The elec-
tromyography records of an electrically evoked blink reflex showed at least two compo-
nents (R, and R, components). The first or early response (R,) is brief and occurs after
a latency of approximately 10 ms on the side of stimulation [19]. The second response
(R,) has a latency of approximately 30 ms, is bilateral, and more prolonged in time [19].
The R, response causes the actual contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle [19]. The
optimal stimulus intensity was sought by gradually increasing the current until visual
observation of the EMG showed that, in the presence of a visible R, component, the R,
component reach its maximum amplitude [20].

Figure 5, uppermost panels, illustrates the two components of a normal blink reflex.
The averaged electromyographic records of the blink reflex were obtained from the four
consecutive electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve (interstimulus interval 5 ms).
The first rows showed baselines. Vertical lines marked the beginning and end of the indi-
vidual components (R, and R,), marked by an expert neurophysiologist at the end of the
session, using the marker tool of the VikingQuest’ neurophysiological device. The right
margins showed estimated propofol concentrations (g/mL), clinical endpoints (loss of
R,, loss of R, and LORP), depth of sedation/anesthesia level (aRASS score), and the time

since propofol started.

Data analysis

Before proceeding with data analysis, we removed the DC component by subtracting the
mean amplitude from the EMG signals. We then removed the best straight-fit line (in
the least-squares sense) from the EMG signals with the detrend function of MATLAB®.

For each pre-processed EMG signal, we selected two specific subsets of samples: T,
from 10 to 25 ms, in which it is expected R, to be analyzed, and T,, from 25 to 200 ms, in
which R, is expected to be analyzed.

Data from each subset was analyzed in both time and frequency domain. In the time
domain, after rectifying and normalizing each subset of data, the following features were
extracted: mean amplitude (V,,,..,,), and the difference between the maximum (equal to
1) and the mean amplitudes (V4.,).

Because R, and R, responses were abolished before LORP and, consequently, there
was an insufficient number of data points, a frequency-domain analysis was also
performed. A non-parametric Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using Welch’s modified
periodogram was used to extract functions from the frequency domain. EMG was
windowed with a Hamming window and the modified periodogram was calculated
for each time period. The Power Spectrum Density (PSD) was estimated by averaging
over all resulting periodograms. For this purpose, MATLAB® was used. The following

features from the frequency domain were extracted:

range 30-120 Hz;

« Total power (P,,.,; [dB]): the sum of all the PSD estimate values;

« Ratio between Pyo¢q) ANd fmnedian (Ptotat/fmedian [dB/Hz]);

¢ Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR [dB]): the ratio of the PSD of the signal (meaningful
information) with respect to the power of the background noise;

estimate;

¢ Spectral entropy: The Shannon entropy of the PSD estimate, i.e., the evaluation of the
shape of the PSD estimate [22].

Prediction probability analysis

The capacity of the extracted features to detect the different sedation/anesthetic levels
reflected in the numerical scale of anesthesia, aRASS was evaluated using prediction
probability (P,) statistics by correlating the parameter values during the two different
study periods with the numerical scale.

To calculate P,, we used a user-friendly program, the P, Tool version 3.0, which
included a context help, and colleagues [23] kindly provided the software and developed
the algorithm according to the original [24]. A value of P,=0.5 means that the indicator/
feature correctly predicts the sedation/anesthetic states only 50% of the time, i.e., no bet-
ter than a 50:50 chance. A value of P,=1 means that the indicator/feature predicts the
aRASS correctly 100% of the time. P, was calculated using pooled data from all patients.

Multinomial logistic analysis

The relation between the aRASS level of sedation/anesthesia and the EMG effect
reflected in each extracted feature was modeled with a multinomial logistic regression
(MLR) using a multiple predictor features defined by:

 

P NM
in; = Bot+ > — BrXx, (2)
k=1
Ferreira et al. BioMed Eng OnLine (2020) 19:84 Page 15 of 16

where P represents an outcome (or dependent variable) as a probability, 6o...6,, repre-
sent the constant of the coefficients of the regression model, and X,...X, represent the
predictor (or independent) variables [25].

Statistics
The Kolmogorov—Smirnov test was used to test for normal distribution. Paired samples
t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the means of related data. Cor-
relation analysis was performed using the Pearson R test for normally distributed data or
the Spearman rank R when data were not normally distributed. Data were presented as
mean along with standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), unless stated
otherwise, in our logistic regression analysis.

In the same experimental session of each subject, we evaluated our regression mod-
els using mean values, otherwise, the variance of each predictor variable would be com-

puted as much lower. P value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
