Aarhus University, Birk Centerpark University-Industry (U-l) relation, contains barriers related to the differentiation of

15, 7400 Herning, Denmark structure and purpose for each organisation. Both the university and industry have to
make sure that they have access to data and information. This accessibility enables
the value-added process of transforming data into knowledge. The purpose of this
paper is the analysis of U-| cooperation- especially under the new online
requirements — an illustration of how the knowledge is created and shared in the
organisation based on the socialisation, externalisation, combination, and
internalisation (SECI) model and how this is aligned to the value proposition. As a
knowledge management example case, a database for the Centre for Energy
Technologies of Aarhus University was developed that will overtime help the
university to increase its value proposition and be the heart of knowledge exchange
with the industry in an organised way. The value of this work is intended to pave
the way in building structured working relations between the industry and
academia, facilitating the means in order to achieve a higher degree of overall
efficiency.

Introduction
Collaboration between University and Industry exists for more than 100 years. In a
knowledge-based economy, this interplay and the outcomes of the particular type of
cooperation considered to be significant for both sides (Edmondson, Valigra, Kenward,
Hudson, & Belfield, 2012). University and industry are organisations that despite their
differences in structure and actions, they both use knowledge to achieve their goals, ei-
ther creating and share new knowledge or gain financial profit. They can establish a
research-based partnership that focus on the development of new products (tangible
or intangible) or test products that already exist.

Although this collaboration is very profitable for both sides, it faces some barriers

that require detailed coordination and proper communication. These barriers occur

mainly because these organisations use, create or acquire knowledge that is not aligned
with each other. Another important feature that is related with the differentiation of
the goals of these two organisations is that Universities are more interested in topics
and projects that their community find interesting to examine, while Industry tends to
develop projects and solve problems that are valuable to their customers (Rosenberg &
Nelson, 1994).

Knowledge transfer is an internal process which is been implemented within the en-
vironment of the organisation. As a result, every external knowledge that is new to the
organisation require competencies that will ensure the acquisition, storage and re-use
of the new knowledge (Gilbert & Cordey-Hayes, 1996). Knowledge creation is illus-
trated through the SECI model of Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), where they imple-
mented a four-step process that explains how tacit and explicit knowledge is converted
into organisational knowledge and transferred within the environment of the organisa-
tion. This iterative process is continuously creating, re-use and diffuse the knowledge
in the organisation increasing its value. University and Industry have different motives
that enable them to develop this collaboration (Dang, Jasovska, Gulzar Rammal, &
Schlenker, 2019; Robertson, McCarthy, & Pitt, 2019; Thomas & Paul, 2019).

Each organisation perceive value and value proposition in a different way according
to its orientation, purpose and structure (Nielsen & Sort, 2013). On one hand, univer-
sity creates new knowledge and share it through teaching and research-based activities.
On the other hand, industry captures, creates or reproduces knowledge and shares it in
most cases strictly within its environment in order to achieve profit and viability on the
long term (Dasgupta & Paul, 1994). What has been lately gaining attention over the last
decades is research and development (R&D) departments within companies that create
new knowledge, without necessarily having developed the mindset of sharing this
knowledge, which influences radically innovation (Knudsen, 2007). A number of pre-
cautions are often taken, such as confidentiality agreements, sharing constraints and
strictly classified outputs belonging to the specific departments of the companies
(Tourangeau, 2018). Thousands of researchers produce results and use their company’s
affiliation — and only that (Jorgensen, Tambo, & Xydis, 2019; Xydis & Mihet-Popa,
2017). This approach has created no-share mentalities and confidential research works
that will never be shared, some of which could have been inspiring or the starting point
for other researchers in some other part of the world in industry or academia
(Czarnitzki, Grimpe, & Pellens, 2015).

Knowledge, which is on the top of the pyramid and the outcome of the adding value
process of transforming data into information, can be also optimised by using Informa-
tion Technology (IT). Even the usage of social media it has been proven that it plays a
crucial role in knowledge creation in the university (Saide, Indrajit, Trialih, Ramadhani,
& Najamuddin, 2019). IT contains tools such as database management systems, which
can effectively create databases where data are stored, processed, categorised and finally
enable the user to understand and gather experience and knowledge. This work comes
to propose a technology-based solution to confront the no-share matter. It introduces a
database that Centre for Energy Technologies (CET) of Aarhus University will use in
the future where each user will have specific rights according to the agreements be-
tween the industry and the university aiming at registering information and research
projects mapping the knowledge proposing a global solution of a Cloud-based database,

adding to the online education model for engineers which gains more and more atten-
tion. The remainder of this paper includes five more sections. The literature review
part, where various approaches on knowledge sharing are presented, the methodology,
the business model canvas of the university, the technical infrastructure, which in this
case is the CET database constructed and the conclusions section.

Literature review

Well-known theories related to knowledge management were analysed for the specific
paper, focused on the importance of collaboration, the benefits for each side and their
goals. Then the SECI model of Nonaka is presented which describe the iterative process
of organisational knowledge transfer and creation. Lastly, they are mentioned important
barriers in the knowledge transfer that occur in an organisation.

Collaboration types and practices between University-Industry (U-I) have been in-
creased since the 1980s. It has been mentioned that these partnerships started to focus
on pure exchange of knowledge, co-invention of patents and R&D projects (Levy, Roux,
& Wolff, 2007). From the perspective of the industry, this collaboration is considered
to be as a very important link that is directly connected with consultancy and joint re-
search (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002) based on fundamental dimensions for success-
ful collaborative relationships (Schiuma & Carlucci, 2018). If the partnership between
U-I is successfully established and stable regarding knowledge-transfer and coordin-
ation, both participants can benefit in various sectors. The data from academia can be
utilised to build new ideas (Xydis, Pechlivanoglou, & Nayeri, 2015), proof of concepts
(Papadopoulou, Alasis, & Xydis, 2019), and eventually products (Koscis & Xydis, 2019).
According to Lee (2000), each participant must fulfil the requirements and needs of the
other in order to maintain this profitable collaboration and both of them achieve their
goals. The main reasons for a collaboration from the perspective of the University are
related to finding practical problems in the industry that can be solved and taught in
courses, creating job opportunities easily accessed for research assistants, students and
graduates with lab experiments, extended research, internships and jobs, testing the ap-
plicability of the theories and knowledge in the demanding and dynamic environment
of the industry and finally gaining knowledge by researching in a new product (tangible
or intangible) or problem that needs a solution. One of the final scopes is to teach
based on entrepreneurial learning processes since this way students start to think and
act as entrepreneurs as early as possible and perform relevant projects in knowledge-
intensive Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) environment (Secundo et al.,
2017). Students learn to survive (if not to thrive) in a multiple stakeholder environment
inside the university network (Secundo, Dumay, Schiuma, & Passiante, 2016). On the
other side, the industry is aiming to use the external knowledge in order to create new
products, re-design the conformation of a specific sector or process to achieve im-
proved product/service quality, assure that it has access to new knowledge by hiring
well-educated graduates and get access to new technology and become more innovative
by inventing in an R&D partnership. What is proven to be crucial for future collabor-
ation, is mutual trust, which today is questionable. Oliver, Montgomery, and Barda
(2019) identified two levels of trust; organisational and individual.

According to Nonaka and Konno (1998), knowledge is categorised into tacit and ex-
plicit. Tacit knowledge is not easy to be explained and diffused because it is based on
Tzavidas et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:20 Page 4 of 16

the individual’s experiences and beliefs, personal work and practice. Tacit knowledge is
categorised into technical and cognitive dimension. Technical dimension refers to the
individual’s capabilities acquired by doing and practising and are described as personal
skills. Cognitive dimension describes the beliefs, individual’s way of thinking, values
that are deeply-rooted in every person in an organisation (Koedinger, Corbett, &
Perfetti, 2012). They are difficult to describe and it is the knowledge influencing the
most the perception the individual has about the world. According to Howells (1995)
“ijt appears that tacit is not forever tacit and with effort, it can be partially formalised
and partially communicated”. Explicit knowledge is easily quantitively and qualitatively
depicted. It is in the hand of an organisation to share it with different forms like data,
scientific paper, computer applications and manuals that are easily accessible by indi-
viduals. According to Zhang (2017), organisations have to seek explicit knowledge in
every type of document and for tacit knowledge from individuals that have the proper
skills in the organisation. Explicit knowledge can be easily accessed and transferred be-
tween individuals while tacit knowledge can only be diffused between knowledge
holders. Yusuf (2008) stresses that commercialisation and knowledge sharing is crucial
when the knowledge is either uncodified or tacit. Restrictions on open knowledge shar-
ing do have a negative impact in innovation, business creation, and eventually confront-
ing societal challenges. It was found in a literature based study in China for instance,
that output and behaviour control practices influence negatively the cooperation per-
formance between U-I (Xu, Zhou, Xu, & Li, 2014). In the case of a collaboration with
an industrial partner, the university’s researchers will have the opportunity to work to-
gether and cooperate. By doing this, it is easier to share their tacit knowledge, building
trust Oliver et al. (2019) and socializing through observation and discussion
(Castelfranchi, 2004). By adopting a multi-disciplinary observation based perspective,
the complexities of how organisations convert knowledge to a long-lasting advantage
can be tackled (Moustaghfir, Schiuma, Moustaghfir, Schiuma, & Schiuma, 2013).

Externalisation refers to the process of converting tacit into explicit knowledge. Dur-
ing this step, knowledge is captured and codified into documents, databases, images.
This crystallisation enables and supports the diffusion of knowledge between individ-
uals in the organisation. An important key aspect of this process is the metaphor, which
is a simple way of understanding a concept by using a comparison to another concept
or an idea. Barnes, Pashby, and Gibbons (2002) referred to the formalisation of pro-
cesses and interactions as a success factor that improved the knowledge creation and
diffusion, while Lerro, Iacobone, and Schiuma (2012) focused onto intelligent and agile
organisations in order to achieve new development paths. That occurs because any re-
searcher of the organisation can get advises from previous projects regarding a specific
process or experiment that is useful in another project or can take part later at the spe-
cific project and acquire the required knowledge in order to successfully contribute and
be adapted in the team.

The combination is the phase where the explicit knowledge is converted into a more
complex form. While the type of knowledge is the same, its structure is a combination
or sets of explicit knowledge. This result occurs because of the exchange, combination
and integration of knowledge between individuals through documents, e-mails, meet-
ings or other tools that are supported by Information and Communication Technology.
In practice, combination is the outcome of three steps. The first step is the collection
Tzavidas et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:20 Page 5 of 16

and combination of externalised knowledge such as public data, while the collection of
this knowledge can take place inside or outside of the organisation. Then, the diffusion
of the explicit knowledge between individuals in the organisation is supported by pre-
sentations and meetings ensuring the creation of new knowledge. Ultimately, the edit-
ing and processing part of explicit knowledge like reports, plans and market data leads
to a more usable and accessible explicit knowledge. Combination exists in research
(university) when scientists cite each other works or when researchers are writing a
paper based on a project that is the outcome of a collaboration between U-I. According
to Hermans and Castiaux (2006), this part of knowledge spiral supports the arrange-
ment of new meetings between researchers in order to further discuss the technical as-
pects of the report. In these meetings, new tacit knowledge can be shared.

The process of internalisation refers to the conversion of explicit knowledge into tacit
and is described by Nonaka, Takeuchi, and Umemoto (1996) as “learning by doing”.
This process is accomplished if individuals in the organisation apply methods or con-
cepts that already exist in organisation’s documents or databases and if they experiment
or run simulations during their work time or during collaborations. Based on a study, it
was proven that knowledge-intensive business services companies (from the UK and
US) engaged in a doing-using-interacting mode of organisational learning, had an active
and intense collaboration with universities for innovation (Lee et al., 2019). Projects
that are based on collaboration between U-I enable the researchers of the University to
build relationships and the possibility of a future collaboration between them on more
fundamental issues (Burnside et al., 2008; Hermans & Castiaux, 2006; Kauppila,
Mursula, Harkonen, & Kujala, 2015).

Knowledge transfer differs from other types of transactions because it depends on an
equal exchange so both participants benefit approximately with the same way. It is con-
sidered, like knowledge management, as an internal process which is based on the
process of knowledge by using skills inside the organisation that will contribute posi-
tively and increase the overall outcome quality (Amesse & Cohendet, 2001). Looking at
the case of U-I relationship, projects are developed based on this cooperation. There,
knowledge is flowing from a source that is outside of the environment of the organisa-
tion and the development of activities are related with the acceptance of the new know-
ledge, the diffusion and the assimilation of it by all the individuals that are involved on
the project is critical (Gilbert & Cordey-Hayes, 1996). According to Etzkowitz & Ley-
desdorff, (2000), the source of knowledge creation in an organisation which has an edu-
cational and research purpose like University is in the three main functions of it:
Through courses and every action that has as a goal the education of the individuals in
the organisation, the development of research work which is related with laboratories,
scientific papers and R&D and finally, their presence in social and economic develop-
ment. Chatterjee’s (2014) definition about knowledge sharing is the competences of in-
dividual and collective learning. On the one hand, individuals gather skills and abilities
by doing their work or training. On the other hand, Collective learning refers to the
whole organisation’s communities of practice.

Universities can be positively affected by knowledge management in ways that are re-
lated to the industry collaboration, better researchers’ and students’ learning and finally
reducing the costs of its operational activities. It is necessary for the University to es-
tablish the knowledge transfer between individuals and confront the factors that slow
Tzavidas et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:20 Page 6 of 16

down this process (Killingsworth, Xue, & Liu, 2016). In order to overcome the obstacles
in knowledge transfer and increases its performance, the organisation has to find, iden-
tify and disable the factors that create bottlenecks and limitations in the flow of know-
ledge (Chatterjee, 2014). Han (2017) focused on knowledge sharing between U-I when
it comes to patent creation. It was proven by an analysis in 263 SMEs in a region in
South Korea that industry influences negatively patent applications. It is important to
stress that it is not only when companies are involved that knowledge sharing is drop-
ping. It is a huge issue in academic institutions. Kumaraswamy et al. (2012) pointed out
that there are factors that have a negative impact in collaborative knowledge sharing
culture also in an academic institute. According to Nychis, Sekar, Andersen, Kim, and
Zhang (2008), knowledge sharing is affected the most by three different aspects in an
organisation. These aspects are culture, management and technology and they are dir-
ectly related to higher costs and lower income. According to Riege (2005), knowledge
management and diffusion have to be adapted in the culture of the organisation instead
of changing the culture to fulfil the requirements needed for effective knowledge man-
agement. Bottlenecks can also show up when the organisation is not making proper
use of the technology. That happens when there is unsuitable technology, not effective
training and information or when the individuals are not willing to use the technology
properly. Kukko and Helander (2012) state that in inter-organisational knowledge
transfer like project collaboration uncertainty and equivocality are the main reasons of
slow knowledge transfer. Uncertainty is the lack of information that the one or both of
the collaborators are missing and are necessary to accomplish a task as part of the pro-
ject (Anatan, 2018). In order to bridge the gap, each participant has to gather the rele-
vant data and information so the required knowledge can be produced (Galbraith,
1977). Equivocality refers to the misunderstanding of the current information each or-
ganisation acquires. According to Daft and Weick (1984), multiple and confusing inter-

pretations that exist in the organisation are refined as ambiguity.

Methodology

An analysis was conducted on the technical infrastructure of the organisation. Litera-
ture review has been favourable to test the hypothesis of the specific papers, ensuring
representable data of U-I collaborations, the correlation of knowledge management and
the value proposition of the University.

Qualitative, deductive research was conducted to test the hypothesis that SECI Model
of Nonaka can be applied to map the knowledge creation and diffusion, which increases
the value proposition of Universities and that the use of IT can benefit knowledge
management.

The hypothesis formulated in order to answer the following research questions:

e How the University can capture and diffuse effectively this knowledge in its
environment.

e Why knowledge creation and diffusion are important for potential cooperation with
the Industry.

e Why and how IT can reinforce knowledge creation and transfer (via an online

learning environment).
Tzavidas et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:20 Page 7 of 16

The main outcome of the deductive research was the visualisation of knowledge cre-
ation and transfer in the University, the role of IT in these processes and the direct im-
pact knowledge management has on the value proposition of the organisation. Figure 1

presents the methodology followed in a flowchart.

The business model canvas of the university

In order for the organisation to be able to involve in any kind of external knowledge in-
teractions, add new knowledge in its environment and gather funds for research that
will contribute in knowledge creation and sharing, it is crucial to have a clear picture
and understanding of the value creation process. In their work on U-I collaborations,
Hadar, Marin, Costoiu, Boanta, and Cismasu (2016) and Nielsen and Sort (2013) have
used the Business Model Canvas to analyse the collaboration of the University-Industry
and how the value is created and supported (Fig. 2).

Key partnerships

Organisations are seeking for alliances in order to benefit, sustain competitiveness and
gain external resources. In the case of U-I, this partnership is a joint venture that its
main purpose is to create value for each participant. University as an organisation may
have several key partnerships. The government sector (research funding) and external
researchers (a collaboration between different universities and industrial partners) are
not directly related but can be aligned with the strategic goals of the University to build

a proper relationship with the industry.

Key activities

The actions that are illustrated to this block are the most valuable for the business
model, in order to achieve high performance. Key activities are directly connected with
customer relationships and value proposition. Research is a key aspect of the University
as an educational organisation and a module that quantifies the performance and in-
creases the prestige of the University (Lynn, Reddy & Aram, 1996). Research and publi-
cation of academic research is also an illustration related to the knowledge that exists
in an organisation and the scientific sectors that are focused on. When the university is
in a joint venture, its activities can vary. It is possible to participate in the design of a
product that the industrial partner will produce or to act as an external consultant that

assists a company to train its employees in order to increase its performance.

Key resources

Key resources refer to the assets that an organisation must obtain in order to develop
its business model. Financial resources are crucial because they support the operation
and the research that is conducted in the university. External knowledge interactions
with Industrial partner allows the university to create new knowledge and gain insight
into practical problems that are worth teaching (Lee, 2000). Experienced and well-
educated researchers can add and produce new knowledge, which will contribute to the

overall value that is offered by the university.

Customer relationships

The particular block demonstrates the structure of the relationship the organisation
has with its customer. From the university’s perspective, an Industrial partner can be
taken into account as a customer because it is usually funding the research that the
University conducts in order to apply its knowledge. University creates new knowledge
that can be shared through its organisation and the industrial partner/customer creates
value that is used for profit. As a result, they collaborate to co-create value for each
other.

Communication channels

Organisations make use of channels in order to illustrate their area of expertise, inform
the customers so they can evaluate the University’s Value Proposition and create a
touch point with the customer in order to arrange and proceed to the purchase of a
product/service. With various tools such as databases, website development, every pro-
ject of the university can be presented along with the academic and professional back-
ground and CV of the researchers that worked on the project. Other tools like e-mails
and Voice over Internet Protocol meetings can be used for knowledge diffusion. For ex-
ample, partners can arrange online meetings for further discussion of the project or
send report files related to the progress of the research. Databases can be used as
Tzavidas et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:20 Page 9 of 16

technical infrastructure of knowledge creation because they can contain data and infor-
mation of an old project that will be the base for future research of the university.

Customer segments

Customer segments block refers to the customers that the organisation is interested in.
The University has to analyse their interests, compare them with the needs of the po-
tential customer and finally establish a cooperation that will benefit both the university
and the customer. CET in Aarhus University is focused in the areas of renewable en-
ergy, energy demand, electricity markets, and hydrogen among others. As a result, the
centre cooperates with companies that have interests that are aligned with theirs like

new and innovative energy systems.

The value proposition and IT as a technical infrastructure (CET database)
Value proposition is characterised by a set of tangible or intangible products and ser-
vices with specific attributes that have as a purpose to satisfy the customers’ needs.
These products or benefits can vary from organisation to organisation, depending on
the different orientation, structure and characteristics. Some of them can be innovative
while others are similar to existing products with added characteristics.

The value proposition of the university is based on knowledge creation and diffusion.
While the size of the company should be taken into account when evaluating the needs
of the industrial partner, new knowledge is a common feature that exists in the agenda
of every company (Osterwalder, 2010). Small startups and medium enterprises focusing
more on the access of new technology and knowledge but also to create a connection
with students while large corporations benefit more by scouting and recruiting talented
graduates (Sharpe & Belz, 2016). These customer needs are aligned with how effectively
the university creates knowledge in order to manage the technology it acquires and dif-
fuse its knowledge to students.

According to Osterwalder (2014), the value proposition canvas zooms into the details
of the Business Model canvas and is more customer-oriented. It is a tool that integrates
with business model canvas and then both of them provide a detailed plan of how to
create and sustain value into the organisation and deliver it to the customer.

The value proposition canvas (Fig. 3) consists of the value map and customer profile.
The customer profile illustrates what the customer is trying to do (“customerjobs”),
what pitfalls and bottlenecks exist during/before/after this task (pains) and the desirable
outcome (gains). By observing the customer characteristics, it is easier to describe how
the company is planning to create value for the specific customer through the value
map. The value map demonstrates how the organisation is going to create value based
on the specific customer profile. CET is mainly interacting and cooperating with indus-
trial companies that focus on renewable energy, energy trading and energy storage.
Their “customerjobs” related to this potential cooperation are linked to create - im-
prove a product and develop - improve a process in their company. The pains that lead
companies to interact with universities are related to lack of knowledge and proper en-
gineering education. The employees may lack training or proper equipment that is re-
quired for R&D, need advice regarding the way they have to approach a problem, how

to solve a technical or design problem or how to deal with the consequences of a mal-

function in the company.

Value map illustrates the products the university offers, how these products will deal
with the customer pains and in which way they will add profit to the company. Univer-
sity’s products, which are based on knowledge diffusion, are directly related to R&D
and consultancy. A collaboration between U-I will stimulate the R&D sector of the in-
dustrial partner by getting access to new knowledge and technology. Furthermore, new
knowledge/technology access can support the customer to deal with uncertainty and
lack of training by conducting webinars, scientific research, run simulations and get the
results it needs in order to further action. Moreover, this collaboration will give access
to university's network from which the company can create a connection with re-
searchers for future collaboration or recruit well-educated graduates.

Big data have driven the organisations in the process of extracting and dealing with
data seeking patterns and information in general that will add new knowledge in their
environment (Khan & Vorley, 2017; Pillania, 2008). For many years, organisations make
use of IT, using various tools that help individuals to enforce knowledge transfer co-
operating in order to interact with technology, using technology to establish an inter-
action between the members of the organisation or linking members. Organisations
have established knowledge repositories like catalogue filling systems and databases so
individuals can easily access this knowledge. More specifically, databases are very useful
because every member of the organisation can have access (Schreiber & Carley, 2003).
This is aligned with what Fengjie, Fei, and Xin (2004) explain in their work. They refer
to the organisation as the preferable place to store knowledge. Knowledge must some-
how be stored in organisation so that every member has access. Knowledge that is
stored explicitly can be found in databases with the form of simple tables (relational da-
tabases) or semi-structured text (Preece, Flett, Sleeman, et al., 2001). Organisation’s
success is highly connected with IT and the effectiveness of its system is aligned with
its design and development process (Currim & Ram, 2012; Tunstall-Pedoe, 2006). IT
supports the development of knowledge management in an organisation. Several
Tzavidas et al. Smart Learning Environments (2020) 7:20 Page 11 of 16

software applications have been created over the years for the specific use besides sup-
porting the organisation’s information systems need. Data processing, data storage and
communication technologies are facilitating knowledge management. It makes use of
databases and data warehouse in order to store and process data/information and also,
enterprise resource planning systems. In the era of Big Data, the storage and process of
data/information have been increased sharply due to the rapid progress of IT and as a
result, the manipulation of them is easier to develop.

According to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), “Reconfiguration of existing information
through sorting, adding, combining, and categorizing of explicit knowledge (as con-
ducted in computer databases) can lead to new knowledge”. Combination, the third
step in SECI model is also significantly reinforced by using technologies, such as data-
bases (Fig. 4), that are related with knowledge discovery system (Becerra-Fernandez,
2010) knowledge (as conducted in computer databases) can lead to new knowledge”.

The design of databases is a three-step process: The conceptual, logical and physical
design part. At first, it will be illustrated the conceptual part of a database in which
Aarhus University will store information about the researchers at CET, the projects that
every researcher is involved with and information about the companies that the Univer-
sity cooperates or has cooperated in the past. According to Casanova, Breitman,
Brauner, and Marins (2007), “A database conceptual schema is a high-level description
of how database concepts are organised, which is typical as classes of objects and their
attributes”. The conceptual part of the database design attempts to schematically illus-

and attributes. These different components are a set of data and relations that will be
stored in the database. The cost and complexity of the database development is signifi-
cantly increased by the number of entities, correlations and attributes (Zhao, Tan, &
Zhang, 2003).

The purpose of this database is to give access to CET members the information re-
lated to the projects, previous cooperation with industrial companies that will work to-
wards knowledge creation and transfer.

CET consists of researchers, which will interact with the company in order to develop
a potential project. Researchers have a last name, first name and an identity card (ID).
A researcher can be Professor, Associate professor, Assistant professor, postdoctoral re-
searcher and PhD student. Personal information of the researchers like phone number,
email and date of birth are unnecessary elements because they already exist in another
database of the university and are not aligned with the orientation of this database. It is
important to mention that the communicating language of the researcher has to be
specified, which is crucial, especially in the early stages of the project where both part-
ners are trying to establish a proper relationship. Project has a project name, project
ID, a description, a starting date and finish date. The starting/finish date gives informa-
tion to the user about the duration of the project which can be a piece of useful infor-
mation because researchers can compare similar projects that their duration varies and
evaluate why this happened. Companies have a name, location, phone number and e-
mail address (Fig. 5).

The physical design and writing of the database was developed with the Relational
Database Management System MySQLworkbench 6.3 (Fig. 6). The University_Projects
database will be populated with data that will be acquired from CET department and

include:

e Researcher’s first and last name,

e languages he/she speaks,

e when he/she joined and left/completed the project,
e the project's name and project’s description.

e starting and finishing date of the project.

e the company’s name, e-mail address, phone number and physical location.

University Projects is a relational database that is consisted of 8 tables. Tables have
identifiers as primary keys that have the suffix id and they have a yellow question mark
on the left. For example, idResearcher refers to a unique researcher. The attributes that
contain a blue rhombus cannot be null, which means that they necessarily require a

value.

Conclusion

The main purpose of this work was the development of an online database that CET of
Aarhus University will use in the future aiming at being more efficient in knowledge
sharing with the industry. The development of a database related to the projects and
the companies that are connected with the university gives the ability to store informa-
tion that will be accessible for future research by individuals in the organisation that
did not take part to the projects during their implementation phase. It was developed

with the Relational Database Management System MySQLworkbench focusing at being
simple granting easy access to all members at the centre regardless their IT literacy
levels. A significant effort that works as a leverage of the organisational knowledge is
the use of IT. Databases and Information and communications technology (ICT) sys-
tems work also as a technical infrastructure of the U-I cooperation because they im-
prove the communication between the two organisations and as a result, improve the
inter-organisational knowledge diffusion.

Furthermore, an examination of the cooperation between U-I by locating the bottle-
necks in this relationship already mentioned in the literature — and what are the poten-
tial benefits for each of them — was conducted. In most cases, the industry seeks the

external knowledge, the problem-solving capabilities and the engineering education

that the University offers. This has to do not only with the innovative products or re-
search done at the university, but also with connections, links with other scientific
fields and opportunities for scientific excellence in connection with other sectors, which
inevitably could lead to market share growth for the industry. The motivations of the
companies for potential cooperation are directly connected with how effectively the
university makes use of knowledge management. The Business Model Canvas and the
Value Proposition Canvas were used in order to demonstrate the way the University
will make use of the knowledge it creates and the important link between knowledge
creation and value proposition. The SECI model illustrated in four steps how the know-
ledge is created and transferred in the organisation while the Value Proposition Canvas
makes use of the Value Map and the Customer Profile in order to model the way this
knowledge has to be channelled outside of the organisation creating value and relieving
the pain of the customer’s organisation in order to create a fit and establish a profitable
cooperation. The fit between these organisations is achieved when the Industrial com-
panies are interested in the university’s value proposition.

A limitation to this paper is that is based on the use of IT as a technical infrastruc-
ture of the collaboration between U-I without taking into consideration the perceptions
of the individuals in the organisation regarding the use of the database. Furthermore,
the SECI Model is based on Japanese organisations, where the employers have built
strong relationships due to the larger amount of time spending together in contrast to
the university's employees — which spend more time working distantly and in an online
environment — and as a result, the most difficult part of the SECI model, the socialisa-
tion process, is effectively developed. A question worth answering is in what extend the
IT is affecting the knowledge sharing process in the university and how these factors
that enhance (or slowing down) the process can effectively be identified and measured.
