Department of Industrial The social networks are widely used by millions of people worldwide. The trust
Engineering, Tabriz Branch,

Islamic Azad University, concept is one of the most important issues in Social Network Analysis (SNA) which

Tabriz, Iran highly affects the quantity and quality of the inter-connections, decisions, and interac-
tions among the users in e-commerce or recommendation systems. Many normative
algorithms are developed to calculate the trust which most of them are complicated,
depend on the network structure, and need lots of critical information that makes
them hard to use. The aim of this paper is proposing a descriptive, simple and effective
method for calculating the maximal trust and the trust route between any two users of
an Online Social Network (OSN). For this purpose, four new models for estimating the
trust mechanism of the users are proposed and analyzed using Kolmogorov—Smirnov
and Anderson—Darling statistical hypothesis tests to identify and validate the best-
fitted model based on 20,613 empirical results gathered from 4552 social network vol-
unteers. Due to the time-complexity of the problem, a meta-heuristic algorithm based
on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization method is also developed for solving
the best-fitted model. The proposed algorithm is simulated in Matlab® over six larger
test cases adopted from the Facebook dataset. In order to evaluate the performance of
the developed algorithm, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm
(GA) based meta-heuristics are also simulated on the same test cases. The comparison
of the computational results shows that the ABC approach performs better than the
ACO and GA as the size of the network increases.

Introduction

Online Social Networks are generally web-based services on a platform in which people
can share their ideas, favorites, photos, information and events with each other [1]. Vir-
tual SNs can be divided into public and private groups. In the former type, every kind
of users may exist with different aims and motivations and follow the networks using
related websites or applications. The number of users in such a group often reaches to
a hundred million people. For example, Facebook, Orkut, and Myspace are some of
the most popular public social networks. The latter group is formed around a specific

Flicker on photography are some famous examples.

Social Networks (SN) are growing rapidly and some important aspects like ideas,
behaviors, etc., are diffusing [25]. In these conditions, making the correct decision
under a dynamic situation plays an important role for SN users. The Online Social Net-
works Analysis (OSNA) consists of many different important issues like trust, security,
between-ness, determining the leaders, centrality, prestige, finding maximum cliques,
determining the malignant nodes and so on. Nowadays, SN users are very interested
in sharing data and information. By developing the mobile platforms and their applica-
tions, the social networks are also growing rapidly and most parts of the interactions are
performed by anonymous users. So, the trust concept plays an important key role in the
construction of the relations among the users [26]. Besides, Deng et al. [7] claim that
trust is the most important factor in the decision-making process. Hence, calculating
the trust value has raised the interest of many researchers and due to the time complex-
ity and NP-Hard nature of the problem, plenty of different heuristic and meta-heuristic
approaches are developed.

The users of the SNs have clearly fewer imitations and constraints in choice ability and
making decisions since they are not affected by some factors like location, time, culture,
government, etc., which do exist in the real world and the users can choose in a world-
wide scale. The OSNs provide a platform for users to make better decisions without
getting affected by these factors. Therefore, it is necessary to study the variety and capa-
bilities of each type of SNs as social media. Trust means accepting the risk of being mis-
used and transferring part of assets or privacy with the goal of cooperating with another
actor. In each trust-based relationship, there are at least two components, the truster,
and the trustee. It is assumed that both components are targeted in action and seek to
satisfy their needs. The trusting party must decide whether or not to engage with the
other (i.e., accept the risk), and the trusted party should also choose between maintain-
ing trust or breaking it; therefore, a trust-based relationship is a bilateral act which is
based on the principle of maximizing the benefits under hazardous condition. Under
such conditions, the SN users influence each other and change their behavior. Kumar
et al. [17] evaluated social influence metrics and calculated the probability of an indi-
vidual becoming influenced.

In social networks, trust represents the level of confidence about the reliability and
correctness of the entity’s behaviors [34]. The trust issue is a central concept, people do
this for social action to meet their needs through social transfers, and these exchanges
have a key role in building social action [4]. In OSNs the users can perform many activi-
ties while trust is one of the most important factors needed for making the decisions.
The trust is a mechanism for promoting and propagation of the collaboration among the
users and also plays a role as a security operator which has been widely implemented on
computer networks [7], because keeping or protecting the privacy of the users highly
depends on the amount of the trust they evaluate. A small mistake in such an evalua-
tion, ie., trusting to a hacker or giving access permissions to a spyware program, may
lead to big failure in the collaboration process. The main challenge in calculating the
trust between two users that do not know each other is how and to what measure the
trust value transfers along a social route. This issue requires the evaluation of the trust
Saeidi Comput Soc Netw (2020) 7:3 Page 3 of 21

between two users along the social trust route based on the transitivity property of the
trust, for example, if A trusts B, and B trusts C, then A can trust C [5, 20].

The transitivity property is an important assumption defined or used in many types
of research and some proofs are provided for this issue. Christianson and Harbison [3]
published the paper “Why isn’t trust transitive?” which the title may confuse the readers
so that the trust is not really transitive. A complete definition and discussion on transi-
tivity property is provided by Liu et al. [20, 21], which classify the transitivity property
and prove that trust transitivity exists among the SN users in different ways. The current
research is performed under the transitivity assumption and the empirical results infor-
mally confirm this property.

The current study starts at applied orientation and inductive approach. It means that
the researchers of this study reach the overall results from minor cases. The research
method is descriptive including surveys, questionnaires, and content-analysis. The envi-
ronment of research includes both library and field study. The strategies used contain
surveys, psychology, sociology, and combined concepts. The rest of the paper is organ-
ized as follows: the related work is stated in “Literature review” section. The proposed
trust calculation models and statistical evaluation for finding the best model are dis-
cussed in “The proposed approach” section. The proposed ABC algorithm for solving
the best model is explained in “The proposed ABC algorithm” section, and the conclu-

sions are considered in “Conclusions” section.

Literature review

In this section, a comprehensive review of the literature is studied and discussed. Next,
the research aim and question are stated based on the common weakness of the previous
researches. The research methodology is explained in the last subsection.

Related work

Several studies on SNs are performed by researchers and some methods are proposed
for calculating the trust in the literature. Based on the application type and available
information, these methods can be divided into three groups: the graph-based, mutual
trust, and hybrid models. The more recent researches are studied and reported in this
section.

Guha et al. [13] incorporated the distrust concept in calculating the trust propa-
gation and showed that a small number of expressed trust/distrust by the network
users increases the accuracy of calculating the trust between any two users. Dwyer
et al. [9] compared Facebook and Myspace social networks considering attitude and
behavior point of view. Based on the research results, they concluded that Facebook
users have more trust in this site and its members. Yet, Myspace users are more active
in developing relations and making new friends. Taherian et al. [29] proposed a new
trust inference algorithm named RN-Trust using a resistive network concept. They
evaluated and analyzed this algorithm and reported that it calculates the trust more
accurately than previous approaches. Evans and Wensley [10] focused on the view-
point that the trust is a necessity and essential pre-condition for sharing knowledge.
The main aim of their study was discussing the stochastic relationship between social
network principles, network structure, and trust. They analyzed the trust concept and
Saeidi Comput Soc Netw (2020) 7:3 Page 4 of 21

investigated the power of fiducial relations in societies for making the trust opera-
tive. Zhan et al. [35] proposed a trust maximization algorithm based on task-oriented
social networks and evaluated the performance of the algorithm by some extensive
experiments.

Trust is an essential condition for collaboration in peer-to-peer (p2p) systems. Liu
et al. [18] proposed a model for promoting trust in social networks for p2p systems.
They first proposed a three-layer trust propagation framework consisting of the pro-
motion layer, awareness layer, and calculation layer. Next, they developed an algo-
rithm for implementing and forming trust networks. Their simulation results show
that the trust promotion model can effectively increase the safety and stability of p2p
systems and improve resource availability. Podobnik et al. [23] proposed a model to
convert a user’s individual social graph structure into a more general weighted graph.
They verified their model using a Facebook application named “Closest Friends” and
evaluated the proposed approach with 150 Facebook users. Fong et al. [11] used data
mining techniques to determine the relative importance factors affecting trust in SNs.
They used Feature Selection algorithms prior to constructing a decision tree to clas-
sify the predicted class. Dehghan et al. [6] investigated the presented methods and
algorithms for inferring trust in OSNs and reported their advantages and disadvan-
tages. They concluded that due to the fact that web-based SNs indeed perform on the
trust concept, more accurate and fast algorithms should be developed to help users
gain more valuable information. Daneshmand and Daneshmand [5] presented a defi-
nition of trust based on sociological grounds. They also described several aspects of
trust like transitivity and composability.

A comprehensive review of trust is done by Sherchan et al. [26] in SNs. They stud-
ied the trust from the social and computer science point of view and defined the con-
cept of social trust in the context of social networks for the first time. Three different
aspects of the trust including trust information collection, trust evaluation, and trust
dissemination are covered in this survey. Liu et al. [18] also proposed a new network
structure including trust, social relationships, and recommendation roles and intro-
duced a new concept Quality of Trust (QoT). Next, they modeled the optimal social
trust path selection problem with multiple end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) con-
straints as a multi-constrained optimal path selection problem, which is shown to
be an NP-Complete problem. The preprocessing of a SN using a trustable familiarity
chain detection based on user domain using online SNs’ microworld network prop-
erties and benefits of weak connections is discussed by Jiang et al. [16]. The authors
proposed a method of generating trustable graphs and inspecting real information
adopted from OSNs in order to select strong neighbors using a breadth-first search
algorithm and concluded the effectiveness of this approach. Situm [28] on her mas-
ter’s thesis focused on trust among the users on p2p social networks. She proposed
some algorithms to calculate the trust on Facebook and evaluated the presented
algorithms.

Nufiez-Gonzalez et al. [22] used a machine learning method for predicting trust.
Their proposed method used training techniques to gain the trust value based on rep-
utation features obtained from volunteer users called witness trustors. The machine

learning method for predicting the trust works in a fixed size space, so the variable
Saeidi Comput Soc Netw (2020) 7:3 Page 5 of 21

size of information should be reduced to a constant size volume. Sanadhya and Singh
[24] used the Ant Colony Optimization method for calculating the trust based on the
structural and behavioral properties of the OSNs. They used the Facebook dataset for
simulating their proposed algorithm.

Wang et al. [34] developed a new trust calculation method based on game theory con-
cepts. They divided the nodes of the network into four categories as service nodes, feed-
back nodes, recommendation nodes, and managed nodes to describe the trust degree
more accurately. The authors used service reliability (the trustworthiness of service that
service nodes provide), feedback effectiveness (the trustworthiness of feedback that
feedback nodes return), and recommendation credibility (the trustworthiness of rec-
ommendation that recommendation nodes give) concepts to estimate the trust quantity
and showed the effectiveness of their proposed method. Frikha et al. [12] considered the
time factor for estimating trust between the social network users for recommendation
systems. They developed an application for Facebook users to demonstrate the impor-
tance of time affecting the users’ interaction for determining social friends. Hamdi [141
on her Ph.D. thesis proposed a trust management model named IRIS considering social
activities of users including their social relationships, preferences, and interactions.
Singh and Chin [27] proposed a conceptual framework for calculating the trust among
OSN users and claimed it may be not possible to use mathematical models in offline
networks where users do not have the previous relationship. Takalkar and Mahalle [30]
in their research, reviewed different metrics and methods for calculating the trust value
on SNs and proposed a trust-based approach for discussing the confidentiality in OSNs.

Wang et al. [33] proposed a new trust evaluation scheme based on evidence theory.
The authors considered the risk of privacy leakage by information flow prediction to
make the trust evaluation more comprehensive and compared their method with some
previous algorithms by considering accuracy, mean error, and F-score and concluded the
superiority of the proposed method.

The brief review of related work indicates that all previously developed techniques for
calculating the trust in OSNs are mostly theoretical, impractical, and actually impossi-
ble or hard to implement. For example, Takalkar and Mahalle [30] define a dynamicity
index as the ratio of the number of times the user has logged-in, to the amount of his/
her activities. Obviously, a specific user has no idea about the number of times that other
users have logged-in the network, hence the dynamicity index cannot be calculated.

The research question

The users of the SNs in the real world, construct their interactions based on a mental
trust amount to other users which can be expressed as a real value in [0...1]. As dis-
cussed in “Related work” section, all the previous researches can be considered as nor-
mative approaches that try to construct methods or formulas to indicate how this trust
should be calculated, rather than explaining how people trust each other in fact. In other
words, the social media users, their opinions, their mental and experimental methods
for evaluating the trust are ignored. The main weakness of the previous researches, is
trying to answer the question “How SN users should trust each other?” This research
aims to answer the question “How the SN users trust each other in the real world?” or

“What is the trust mechanism (model) of the real SN users?”
Saeidi Comput Soc Netw (2020) 7:3 Page 6 of 21

In this paper, based on the information gathered by questionnaires from the OSN users,
the more important metrics and the trust mechanism used by individuals are inspired and
extracted and the best-fitted model is selected among the four proposed models. The sta-
tistical analysis shows that the first proposed model better fits the behavior of the SN users
of the statistical society. Therefore, this model is announced as an answer to the research

question.

The proposed approach
In this section, first, the structure of the social network, the questionnaire structure, the
proposed trust calculation models, and the statistical analysis are defined and discussed.

The trust calculation models

The social network considered in this paper is similar to Facebook consisting of millions
of connected people. This structure can be defined as graph G=(V, A), where the V is the
set of vertices (users) where ||G|| = N and the A is the set of arcs or the inter-connections
among the users. This graph is logically undirected because the friendship concept in such
a network is not directional. But the trust concept and its value between any two users are
directional and the corresponding structure should be defined as a directed graph.

As mentioned in “Literature review” section, the trust concept has a transitivity property
among the users of the network [7]. It means that if Alice trusts Bob, and Bob trusts Char-
lie, so Alice can indirectly trust Charlie via Bob. It is obvious that trust value will decrease
as many as the number of intermediate nodes increases. In this paper, the trust value of the
source user v, to the destination user v, is calculated by multiplying the trust values along
the route using the iterative multiplication strategy. If there are multiple feasible routes
between these nodes, the route with maximal trust value is desired. This concept is shown
in Fig. 1.

In this paper, the trust values between any two friends are treated as probability values.
Considering Fig. 1, the trust of the user s to the user m is given as 0.8 which somehow
means that the user s is happy of his/her trust to user m, in 80% of the cases, or the user m
disappoints the user s in 20% of the interactions. Equation (1) represents this issue:

Trust (s > m) = Prob. (m satisfies s) = 1— Prob. (m disappoints s). (1)

In other words, in case of making a decision about a new interaction between these
two users, the user s imagines that the results will be satisfying with a probability of 80%.

\ )
Saeidi Comput Soc Netw (2020) 7:3 Page 7 of 21

The same is true from user m to user d. So, the indirect trust from the user s to the user
d, is equal to the satisfaction probability of two independent events which is calculated
as the multiplication of the consequent probability values.

In Fig. 1, the aim is to calculate the trust value from user s to user d (dashed arrow).
‘These users are not directly connected, but have two friends in common: m and j. So,
there are two possible trust routes. Using the first route (s > j > d) the trust is calculated
as 0.5 x 0.9=0.45 and on the second route (s—> m-— d) is 0.8 x 0.8=0.64. So the sec-
ond route is reported as the trust route with Trust(s > d) =0.64. The trust between two
arbitrary nodes via a path is the product of the trusts along the edges, and trust between
any two parties is the maximal value of trust along any path. So, the general form of this
issue can be written as Eq. (2). The transitivity property of the trust helps us to aggregate
the trust value along with a path from source to destination nodes. Hence trust is dis-
counted with the increase of transitivity hops [3]. This strategy has been widely used in
the literature as a feasible trust aggregation method [19, 32].

Trust(s + d) = Max TW LinkValue (vi, vj) V (vi; vj) EA (2)

where LinkValue(V;,V;) is a positive real value in [0...1] demonstrating the direct trust
of node V; to node Vj. This value is known for the users of the SNs, that is, every user
believes in a specific amount of trust to each of his/her connected friends, although he/
she does not know how this value is formed. As mentioned in “The research question”
section, the main objective of this paper is providing a model to represent the evaluation
mechanism of this value. The parameters affecting the Link Value are not stable and most
of them change in the time, so it can be concluded that the trust of V; to V; will change
(increase or decrease) depending on the positive or negative feedback.

Figure 2 demonstrates a small sample graph with 10 nodes and the trust value of user
V, to user V, is requested. The route highlighted in red shows the best-obtained path with
maximal trust value. It should be noticed that the reverse trust route from user v, to user
v, may be different because of the asymmetric property of the trust.

It is obvious that the problem will be complicated in large networks as there are
numerous nodes, arcs, and feasible routes; and the problem changes to a difficult combi-
natorial optimization problem which needs a long computational time to be solved [12].
So, meta-heuristic approaches are developed by the researchers to tackle this obstacle.

The main objective of this paper is providing a model for calculating the maximal trust
value and the trust route (containing some intermediate users) from user v; to user v; (v;,
VE V) with a maximal calculated trust value. In other words, the user v; needs (or wants)
to know what is the maximal trust he/she can rely on user v; and via which users this
value can be obtained. This is also known as the maximal trust problem which is shown
to be an NP-Hard problem [18].

The trust calculation model is constructed in two stages. At the first stage, a dynamic
individual node value for every user on the network is calculated based on the user’s
characteristics and personal information and at the second stage, the inert-personal
trust value is estimated considering the node values obtained at the first stage using the
proposed model. This information makes up the statistical society of the research and is
used to estimate the trust mechanism of the OSN users and compare the proposed mod-
els with empirical data to figure out the best fitting model.

In order to gather needed information from the statistical society, a two-part ques-
tionnaire is designed using Google Docs and the URL of the questionnaire was distrib-
uted online by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram social media users. The users were
requested to participate in the research and resend the URL address to their own friends.
In the first part of the questionnaire, as shown in Table 1, the volunteers were requested
to score ten listed F, factors (F,, F,, ..., Fj 9) based on a 5-point Likert scale to indicate
their opinion about the most important factors affecting the individual's trustiness.

In the second part of the questionnaire, the responders were asked to state at most five
numbers of their social friends, give values to related F, factors, and declare how much

they trust those friends. Table 2 shows a sample response from a volunteer scoring her

five friends. After the assessment and refinement of the responses, N= 4552 completely
answered sheets remained out of 6167 total responded questionnaires. The incomplete
or inconsistent sheets were ignored. The consistency of the responses was checked by
analyzing the relationships among the answers, for example, a responder of age 16, can-
not hold a Ph.D. degree, or get married. Out of 4552 response sheets, 2797 volunteers
addressed five friends, 1369 volunteers addressed four friends, and the rest addressed
only three friends. Thus, a total number of N’=2794 x 5+1369 x 4+ x 389 x 3= 20,
613 users, their related F, factor values, and trustiness value were gathered. Consider-
ing the Cochran's formula, a sample of size 385 would be enough for a society of size
1000,000,000 or more (a=0.05 error), so the statistical society is large enough to rely on
the results.

By assessing the first part of the questionnaire, it is concluded that the responders
imply that the personal node value (impact factor) of a network user is highly affected
by the user’s activity, the number of his/her friends, job title (occupation position), level
of education and the reports (negative comments, or dislikes) against the user. So, the

node-value calculation formula can be written as Eq. (3):

NodeValue(v;) = wAcitivity(vj) + w2Friends(v;) + w3Likes(vj)
+ waJobTitle(v;) + w5Education(v;) — weReports(v;) VWvy4€ V,
(3)
where w, coefficients are related importance weights of the parameters.

This equation implies that the users with more activities (new posts or sharing oth-
ers’), a higher number of friends and likes, better job positions, higher education, and
less obtained negative reports will have higher prestige, hence they are potentially more
trustable users. The job title is a term that returns some information about the position
and responsibilities of the people. In this paper, these titles are adopted from the United
States’ Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/soc) and are scored based on
questionnaire filled by volunteers. In order to evaluate the weight coefficients, the Part
1 section of the questionnaire is analyzed. This section can be considered as a LF] 10x5

matrix, where F;, is the sum of tick marks of factor i on scale j voted by a total of 455
responders. The corresponding numeric value of the scale attributes Sj are assumed as
{—2,—1, 0, 1, 2} for {Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree,
Strongly Agree}. Next, the weighted sum of each row of the matrix is calculated as:

5
RowSum(i) = S— Fy; Vi = 1,2,...10. (4)
j=l

The factors having small RowSum values are ignored and the remaining factors (F,,
F,, F;, Fs, Fz, and Fy) are normalized and evaluated as w, =0.098, w,=0.101, w,=0.197,
w,= 0.204, w, =0.298, and w, =0.102, respectively.

After calculating the personal node values of the users, these values are normalized.
Next, the direct trust value between two connected nodes (friends) like v; and v; should
be calculated. For this purpose, four calculation models (estimators) are proposed and
defined as Eqs. (5), (6), (7) and (8). The main idea of proposing these models is based
on three simple concepts: (1) the amount I trust you, completely depends on who you
are (your Node Value), and who I am (my Node Value). (2) The trust between the users is
asymmetric, that is, I don’t have to trust you as much as you trust me. (3) The trust of a
person with higher Node Value (social prestige) to a person with lower Node Value, would
be less than the opposite direction. Obviously many mathematical equations can be pro-
posed to preserve these properties, some simple models are considered in this paper as
follows:

Proposed Model #1

NodeValue(v;)

rust (vi > vj) NodeValue(v;) + NodeValue(v;)

Vivi eV. (5)

Proposed Model #2

NodeValue(v;) x NodeValue(v;)

Trust (vj —> vj) =l]- NodeValue(v;) + NodeValuev;) Vivi EV. (6)
Proposed Model #3

Trust (v; > vj) = 1— ,/NodeValue(v;) x NodeValue(v;) Vvi,vj; € V. (7)
Proposed Model #4

Trust (v; > vj) = 1— NodeValue(v;) x NodeValue(v;) Vvi,vj € V. (8)

Evaluation and analysis

In order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the proposed models, the second section of
the questionnaire is used which the volunteers were asked to consider some real social
friends and express how much they trust to each of them. The obtained empirical results
for N’=20613 samples of the questionnaire along with the calculated trust values
using Eqs. (5), (6), (7) and (8) are depicted in Fig. 3. The details behind the calculation

method of these values are quite simple. For example, the user v, (the volunteer filling

umn of Table 2, e.g., trust of user v; to the listed friends Nilay, Mary, John, Michael, and
Dominque, are declared as 0.85, 0.25, 0.7, 0.045, and 0.60 consequently. These are the
Trust(v;—> v;) values which are referred to as Empirical trust values in Fig. 3.

Next, considering the F, through F;, values given in Tables 1 and 2, the NodeValue
parameter is calculated by Eq. (1) for v, using data in Table 1; and also for his/her five
connected v, friends using data in Table 2. Finally, the Trust(v;— v,) estimations are per-
formed using the proposed models which are depicted along with the empirical trust
values in Fig. 3.

As Fig. 3 shows, the calculated (estimated) trust values using Model #1 have a bet-
ter fitness (similarity) to the empirical trust values gathered from the questionnaire
respondents. For making a precise decision, some important statistics are calculated

which are given in Table 3.

The TS statistics is an indicator for monitoring the forecast validity. It is most often
used when the validity of the forecasting model might be in doubt. As long as the
tracking signal is within the limits, the estimation process is in control. Limits are
usually between 2 to 5 standard deviations. Because 1 standard deviation is approx-
imately equivalent to 1.25 MAD, a common boundary of 3 standard deviations (or
+ 3.75 MAD) is used for Upper Control Limit (UCL) and Lower Control Limit (LCL)
[31].

Considering the calculated statistics reported in Table 1, Model #1 consists of the
least estimation deviation in comparison with the other three models. The value of
TS statistics obtained for the proposed Model #1 is between the control limits of
+ 3.75 MAD (— 2.7925 < 2.4015 < 2.7925), whereas the Models #2 and #4, both have
a TS<—3.75*MAD meaning a persistent under-forecasting and the Model #3 with
TS >3.75* MAD suffers over-forecasting. The trust values gathered by the empirical
method along with the values obtained by the proposed models are divided into 10
intervals of length 0.1 which are given in Table 4. The related cumulative probability
functions are depicted in Fig. 4.

Figure 4 and the statistical calculations confirm the Model #1 is a good candidate for
estimation the trust in real SNs. In order to validate and justify this hypothesis, at the
next step, the “goodness of fit” test is performed over the proposed Model #i (i=1, 2,
3, 4) considering the following hypothesis using both Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) and

Anderson—Darling methods.

H, ‘The obtained trust values by the proposed Model #i follow the empirical
distribution.

H, ‘The obtained trust values by the proposed Model #i do not follow the empirical
distribution.

Using SPSS software and assuming the significance level a=0.05, the calculated
p-value using the Anderson—Darling test is calculated as 0.32 for Model #1. So the
hypothesis Hy cannot be rejected because p-value > a. The calculated KS statistics for the
proposed models and the hypothesis test results are given in Table 5. At the significance
level a=0.05, the acceptance critical value is 0.044 which means that the null hypothesis
is rejected for Models #2, #3 and #4, but cannot be rejected for Model #1.

Hence, the validity of the proposed Model #1 is clearly concluded and this model can
be used for calculating the trust between any two connected users. For example, con-
sidering Alice and Bob as two friends with normalized node values equal to 0.135 and

0.284, respectively, the trust between these users would be calculated as:

0.284.
Trust(Alice — Bob) = —__————. = 0.678, (13)
0.135 + 0.284
0.135
Trust (Bob — Alice) = ————_—_- = 0.322. (14)
0.284 + 0.135

Considering Eq. (4) and according to calculated trust values in the above example, it
can be concluded that the trust concept between two friends is not bidirectional and it
completely depends on the node value of both users. So, by identifying the best-fitted
trust model, the proposed maximal trust problem can be formulated as the following

mathematical programming model:

Considering the objective function, the model is known as an unconstrained single-
ration hyperbolic programming problem [15] which is shown to be NP-Hard [2]. Hence,

a meta-heuristic approach based on ABC algorithm is proposed for solving the model.

The proposed ABC algorithm

The Artificial Bee Colony algorithm which was first introduced in 2005 is a population-
based intelligent search method adopted from real honey bee colonies searching for
food. The colonies spread around the hives and try to collect nectar. The initial search
is performed by employed bees randomly in order to explore the larger neighbor source.
Next, they return back to the home and inform the onlooker bees by dancing over the
hive. The onlooker bees watch the dance of the employed bees and choose the food
source. The employed bee whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout and
starts to search for finding a new food source. The algorithm continues until stopping
conditions are met.

A social network graph plays the role of the flower garden (food source). Each flower
(SN user) contains a specific amount of nectar (the user’s social prestige) which is
extracted by honey bees. The nectar extraction means the calculation of the user’s Node-
Value using Eq. (2). The bees begin their tour from the nest (source node) to the last
flower field (destination node) in such a way to maximize total collected nectar, or in
other words, to maximize the trust value over a trust route on the SN. Hence, each of the
bees travels (generates) a route from the source (s) to the destination (d). The honey bees
inform the others about the amount of food they have discovered on their path by danc-
ing around the nest, which corresponds to calculating the Trust(s— d) using Eq. (15)
and selecting the best route among all the traveled routes so far. The summary of adapta-
tion of the maximal trust problem and the ABC algorithm concepts is given in Table 6.

The proposed ABC algorithm is programmed in Matlab® using a personal computer
with a 4.2 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM. The specifications of the simulated test

* Computation time (s)

The idea of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) was first introduced by John Holland in 1960
and next extended by his student David Goldberg in 1989. The GA method is a popula-
tion-based approach and is made up of some chromosomes each of which represents a
solution to the problem being solved. The Ant Colony Optimization first developed by
Dorigo et al. [8] is inspired by real ants and their behavior. Real ants which live in colo-
nies, leave the nest to find food and come back again at every time. Based on observa-
tions, these ants always choose the shortest path to reach the food.

The simulation parameters of the GA and ACO methods are given in Table 8.
These parameters are tuned-up using the trial-error method and the best values
are obtained. Each of the sample test cases is simulated for 10 times and the best-
obtained solution and average computation time (s) in comparison with GA and ACO
results are reported in Table 9. The simulation results show that the computation time
of the proposed ABC is considerably less than that of GA and ACO algorithms, and
as the size of the graph increases, this difference highly increases. The obtained trust
values are better or equal to the results calculated by GA and ACO approaches.

The comparison of the computation time of simulated algorithms for test cases 1
through 4, and test cases 5 and 6 are depicted in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively.

As Figs. 6 and 7 show, the computation time for solving the problem increases
exponentially for GA and ACO approaches when the size of the problem increases,
but the increasing slope of the proposed ABC remains almost linear. The performance
of the ACO is the worst among the others. This is caused by the behavior of artificial

ants. Every artificial ant during its local search for finding the better route, just looks
at the amount of the pheromone on outgoing arcs of the current node and the path
(next arc) selection is made based on local information and the search agents (ants)
have no further (global) information about the whole network which makes it difficult
for them to find a better solution. In Genetic Algorithm, every chromosome demon-
strates a route from the source node (s) to the destination node (d), so the length of
the chromosome may reach to total number of the nodes of the network (N) which
has a negative impact on the performance of the mutation and crossover operations
and affects the computation time. The convergence diagrams of the proposed ABC
algorithm along with GA and ACO approaches for test case 5 are depicted in Fig. 8. In
this figure, the vertical axis shows the value of the calculated trust from the source to
destination nodes and the horizontal axis shows the number of the iterations.

The meta-heuristic algorithms have random nature and the response may change at
every execution. In order to evaluate the stability of the ACO, GA, and the proposed
ABC algorithms, each of the test cases 5 and 6 is executed 50 times and the standard
deviation of the obtained results is calculated and reported in Table 10. The small values
for the standard deviations show the high stability of the algorithms.

initially employed bees. For example, the test case 6 is executed using 40, 60, 150 and

Conclusions

Social networks and their applications are the necessities of today’s life where millions of
users are involved. Almost all of the interactions and transactions are performed based
on the trust which directly depends on one’s personality and the history of his/her previ-
ous activities. The study of the previous work shows that almost all of the proposed algo-
rithms are complicated to understand have not considered the way the people trust each
other in fact. In other words, these researches aim to show how people should trust each
other, rather than how they really do it.

This research in this paper is organized in two phases: the first phase deals with distin-
guishing the trust mechanism between any two users of a social network, and the sec-
ond phase proposes a meta-heuristic for obtaining a trust route based on the result of
the first phase. The trust calculation concept is considered from another point of view
for modeling the trust mechanism of people in the real world. For this reason, using
questionnaires the social media users were asked to score the most important personal
parameters affecting the trust, and also declare how much they trust their friends. This
research proposed four new models for calculating the trust between any two friends of
a social network and the best model is chosen using a statistical hypothesis test based
on the information gathered by questionnaires. The statistical analysis revealed the pro-
posed Model #1 better fits the empirical trust values and describes the behavior of social
users more accurately than the other models. The trust concept provided by this model
is easy to understand and its simplicity is a great benefit. However, the calculation of the
maximal trust and the trust route on a real network needs lots of computational time
and due to the NP-Hard complexity of the problem, a meta-heuristic algorithm based
on Artificial Bee Colony approach is also developed. The proposed algorithm is pro-
grammed in Matlab® and is simulated using a personal computer running Microsoft
Windows 10 with 4.2 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM.

The proposed algorithm is executed for sample test cases adopted from the Facebook
dataset and its efficiency was compared with the Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony
Optimization algorithms. The computational results show that the maximal trust values
obtained by the proposed algorithm are better or equal to the values obtained by GA
and ACO approaches. Besides, by increasing the size of the problems, the slope of the
computation time of the proposed algorithm is clearly less than that of GA and ACO
methods.

The national region and the small number of volunteers contributing to this research
is the main limitation of this research. As a future work perspective, more volunteers
would be involved in different regions of the world. Furthermore, other meta-heuristics
can be developed and compared.
