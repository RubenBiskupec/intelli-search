and 5th percentile of the performance measures over the 10,000 realizations were

Results: Mean loss of accuracy of the putamen SBR z-score was below 1% when the
normal database included at least 15 subjects, independent of subject sample (PPMI|
or clinical), reconstruction method (filtered backprojection or OSEM), and RO! method
(AAL or HV). However, the variability of the accuracy of the putamen SBR z-score
decreased monotonically with increasing size of normal database and was still
considerable at size 15. In order to achieve less than 5% “maximum” loss of accuracy
(defined by the 5th percentile) in all settings required at least 25 to 30 subjects in the
normal database. Reduction of mean and “maximum” loss of accuracy of the
putamen SBR z-score by further increasing the size of the normal database was very
small beyond size 40.

Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that 25 to 30 is the minimum size of
the normal database to reliably achieve good performance of semi-quantitative
analysis in dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT, independent of the algorithm used for
image reconstruction and the ROI method used to estimate the putaminal SBR.

Introduction

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with N-«-fluoropropyl-2B-car-
bomethoxy-3f-(4-I-123-iodophenyl)nortropane (FP-CIT) is widely used for the detec-
tion (or exclusion) of nigrostriatal degeneration in clinically uncertain parkinsonian
syndromes (PS) [1-4]. Visual reading of the FP-CIT SPECT images can be complemen-
ted by semi-quantitative analysis using the specific binding ratio (SBR) to characterize
FP-CIT binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum and striatal subre-
gions [5-10].

SBR analysis is sensitive to site- and/or camera-specific variability of SPECT image
characteristics caused by differences in acquisition and reconstruction protocols, which
limits sharing of normal databases and SBR cutoff values between sites and/or cameras
[5, 11-18]. In prospective studies, this problem can be addressed by harmonization of
acquisition protocols and centralized image reconstruction in an imaging core lab [15-
17, 19]. This is difficult to realize in everyday clinical patient care so that the use of a
camera-specific normal database often is the most straightforward solution in clinical
routine. This is facilitated by the fact that generation of a camera-specific normal data-
base does not necessarily require prospective scanning of healthy subjects. FP-CIT
SPECT images from patients with clinically uncertain PS that have been interpreted
normal in clinical routine might be used retrospectively for the normal database.

This raises the question about the impact of the size of the normal database on the
performance of semi-quantitative analysis. Of particular interest is the minimum size of
the normal database required for good performance of SBR analysis.

More complex methods including convolutional neural networks have been proposed
for automatic classification of FP-CIT SPECT [18, 20, 21]. However, conventional SBR
analysis is still widely used because it is easy to understand (no black box) and achieves
high accuracy provided that an appropriate normal database is used. Furthermore,
more complex methods such as convolutional neural networks usually require consid-
erably larger databases for training and validation than univariate SBR analysis. Thus,
SBR analysis most likely will continue to play a role in FP-CIT SPECT in the future.

The aim of the present study, therefore, was to analyze the impact of the size of the
normal database on the performance of SBR analysis of FP-CIT SPECT in different set-
tings, that is, for two different patient samples, two different reconstruction algorithms,
and two different region-of-interest (ROI) methods to estimate the SBR.

Materials and methods

Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) sample

The first sample of FP-CIT SPECT images used in this study was obtained from the PPMI
(http://www.ppmi-info.org/data) [19]. It comprised the baseline FP-CIT scans of 645 FP-
subjects, 207 healthy control (HC) subjects and 438 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients.
Up-to-date information on the PPMI is given at http://www.ppmi-info.org. The PPMI is a
longitudinal, multi-center study that aims to assess the progression of clinical features, im-
aging, and biologic markers in patients with PD and HC subjects. Details of the PPMI eli-
gibility criteria are given at http://www.ppmi-info.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/
PPMI-AM7-Protocol.pdf. Details of the PPMI FP-CIT SPECT protocol are given at
http://www.ppmi-info.org/study-design/research-documents-and-sops/ [19]. Raw projec-
tion data had been transferred to the PPMI imaging core lab for central image reconstruc-
tion using an iterative ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with
eight iterations and eight subsets and no filtering on a Hermes workstation [22]. Post-
reconstruction attenuation correction according to Chang [23] had been performed using
a site-specific attenuation coefficient derived from phantom measurements performed
during site initiation for the PPMI [24]. A three-dimensional Gaussian filter with 6-mm
full width at half maximum had been applied after attenuation correction [24]. No scatter

correction had been performed [22].

Clinical sample
Three-hundred-and-seventy-two patients from routine clinical patient care were recruited
retrospectively from the database of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.
The patients were categorized into “neurodegenerative PS” and “non-neurodegenerative
PS”. The neurodegenerative group (1 = 186, 45.7% females, 65.9 + 10.4 years) comprised
the Lewy body disease spectrum including PD, PD dementia and dementia with Lewy
bodies, and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes including multiple systems atrophy, progres-
sive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. The non-neurodegenerative group
(1 = 186, 52.2% females, 65.5 + 12.5 years) comprised essential tremor, drug-induced par-
kinsonism, several types of dystonia, psychogenic parkinsonism, and various other diagno-
ses not associated with nigrostriatal degeneration. The clinical diagnoses as standard of
truth were taken from the written report of a movement disorder specialist in the patient’s
file at least 12 months after FP-CIT SPECT in all 186 patients with neurodegenerative PS
(mean follow-up 41 +22 months, range 12-95 months) and in 44 of the patients with
non-neurodegenerative PS (mean follow-up 38+22months, 13-97 months). The
remaining patients with non-neurodegenerative PS had less than 12 months follow-up
and were included to increase sample size and to avoid imbalance with respect to group
size (neurodegenerative versus non-neurodegenerative).

FP-CIT SPECT had been performed according to common guidelines [25] with a
double-head SPECT system (Siemens Symbia T2 or Siemens E.CAM). In order to
Schmitz-Steinkruger et al. EJNMMI Physics (2020) 7:34 Page 4 of 16

ensure consistent image reconstruction in all patients, projection data were retrieved
from the archive and reconstructed retrospectively. Two different reconstruction algo-
rithms were used in all patients. First, SPECT images were reconstructed using filtered
backprojection implemented in the SPECT system software (Butterworth filter of the
oth order with cutoff 0.6 cycles/pixel). Uniform post reconstruction attenuation correc-
tion was performed according to Chang’s method (4 = 0.12/cm) [23]; scatter correction
was not performed. Second, SPECT images were reconstructed using the OSEM algo-
rithm with resolution recovery implemented in the HybridRecon-Neurology tool of the
Hermes SMART workstation v1.6 with parameter settings recommended for FP-CIT
SPECT by Hermes (effective number of iterations 80, postfiltering with three-
dimensional Gaussian kernel of 7-mm full width at half maximum, uniform attenuation
correction with narrow-beam attenuation coefficient 0.146/cm, simulation-based scatter
correction, resolution recovery with a Gaussian model).

Representative FP-CIT SPECT images from the different settings are shown in Fig. 1.

Semi-quantitative SBR analysis

Individual SPECT images were normalized (affine) to a custom-made FP-CIT template
in the anatomical space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) using the Statis-
tical Parametric Mapping software package (version SPM12) [26]. Voxel intensities
were scaled voxel-wise to the 75th percentile of the voxel intensity in a reference region

comprising the whole brain except the striata, thalamus, brain stem, and ventricles [27,
28].

The conventional unilateral putamen SBR was computed by applying anatomical
ROIs predefined in MNI space by the Automatic Anatomical Labeling atlas (AAL) [29].
The mean value of the scaled voxel intensity in the AAL ROI was used to calculate the
conventional SBR (= mean scaled voxel intensity in the ROI - 1).

In addition, hottest voxels (HV) analysis was performed using large unilateral ROIs
predefined in MNI space [30]. The ROIs for HV analysis were much bigger than the ac-
tual putamen volume in order to guarantee that all counts originating from the puta-
men were included. The number of hottest voxels to be averaged for the unilateral
putamen was fixed to a volume of 10 ml. The hottest voxel SBR (HV-SBR) was calcu-
lated as mean scaled voxel intensity in the 10-ml hottest ROI voxels - 1.

SBR analysis was restricted to the putamen, and the minimum of the unilateral putamen
SBR of left and right hemispheres was used in all further analyses. The rationale for this
was that the effect size of the reduction in PD in general is larger in the bilateral putamen
compared to the bilateral caudate, and larger in the contralateral putamen compared to
the ipsilateral putamen [31]. Other conventional semi-quantitative parameters such as
putamen-to-caudate ratio and left-right asymmetry were not considered because they did
not provide additional information beyond the putamen SBR (Appendix).

Statistical analysis

Normal databases of sizes 1 =5, 10, 15,..., 50 were obtained by randomly selecting the
appropriate number of HC subjects (in case of the PPMI sample) or patients with non-
neurodegenerative PS (in case of the clinical sample). Mean and standard deviation of
the SBR in the resulting normal database was used to transform individual SBR values
to z-scores using the following formula: z-score = (individual SBR - mean SBR in nor-
mal database) / standard deviation of SBR in normal database. Overall accuracy, sensi-
tivity, and specificity of the z-score to identify patients with PD (PPMI sample) or
neurodegenerative PS (clinical sample) were computed using a z-score of —2.5 as cutoff.
The whole sample was used as test set in all cases, that is, the test set comprised all
645 PPMI subjects or all 372 clinical patients, independent of the (size of) the normal
database. This was repeated for 10,000 randomly selected normal databases for each
size of the normal database. The mean and the 5th percentile of overall accuracy, speci-
ficity, and sensitivity were computed over the 10,000 repeats. The performance of the
z-score obtained with all HC subjects or all patients with non-neurodegenerative PS as

normal database was used as benchmark.

Results
Box plots of the putamen SBR for the different settings are shown in Fig. 2. The abso-
lute value of the SBR strongly depended on the reconstruction algorithm and on the
method used to estimate the SBR.

Histograms of putamen SBR in HC subjects or patients with non-neurodegenerative PS
showed slightly skewed distributions, mainly due to extended tails towards high SBR
values (Fig. 3). The skewness of the SBR distribution was significantly different from zero

in all settings. The skewness was largest in the patients with non-neurodegenerative PS of

Parkinson's disease (PD) of the PPMI (a) and patients with non-neurodegenerative PS versus patients with
neurodegenerative PS of the clinical sample (b) for different ROI methods to estimate the putamen SBR
(conventional analysis with AAL ROI versus hottest voxels (HV) analysis). Different algorithms to reconstruct
the SPECT images (iterative ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction with
resolution recovery (RR) versus filtered backprojection (FBP)) were tested in the clinical sample only

the clinical sample with OSEM reconstruction with resolution recovery (skewness = 0.877
and 0.908 for AAL-SBR and HV-SBR, respectively). The skewness was smallest in the pa-
tients with non-neurodegenerative PS of the clinical sample with filtered backprojection
(skewness = 0.560 and 0.455 for AAL-SBR and HV-SBR, respectively). In order to account

for the skewness of the SBR distributions, SBR values were Ln-transformed prior to trans-

forming them to z-scores (Fig. 3). This was done in all settings.

Figure 4 shows the impact of the size of the normal database on overall accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity of the putamen SBR z-score to identify patients with PD in
the PPMI sample or patients with neurodegenerative PS in the clinical sample.

Mean relative loss of accuracy and “maximum” relative loss of accuracy of the putamen
SBR z-score for differentiation between PD patients and HC subjects of the PPMI or be-
tween patients with neurodegenerative PS and patients with non-neurodegenerative PS of
the clinical sample as a function of size of the normal database are given in Fig. 5.

Discussion
Mean loss of overall accuracy of the z-score of the (Ln-transformed) putamen SBR was
below 1% when the normal database included at least 15 subjects, independent of the
subject sample, the reconstruction method, and the ROI method (Fig. 5a). However, the
variability of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the putamen SBR z-score decreased
monotonically with increasing size of the normal database and was still considerable at
size 15 (Fig. 4). The “maximum” loss of accuracy of the putamen SBR z-score was less
than 5% when the normal database included at least 25 to 30 subjects (Fig. 5b). This
suggests that a normal database for SBR analysis in DAT SPECT in clinical routine
should include at least 25 to 30 subjects.

Reduction of mean and “maximum” loss of accuracy of the putamen SBR z-score by

further increasing the size of the normal database was very small beyond size 40 (Fig.

5). This suggests that a normal database including 40 subjects provides close-to-

optimal performance of putaminal SBR in DAT SPECT.

Sensitivity was lower than specificity in all settings (Fig. 4). This was due to the rather
conservative cutoff of -2.5 on the z-score for classification of FP-CIT SPECT images.
Sensitivity can be increased by using a less conservative cutoff which, however, will re-
sult in the reduction of specificity. In the absence of disease-modifying treatment for
neurodegenerative PS, the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is usually bal-
anced in favor of high specificity in clinical routine. The use of a rather conservative

cutoff in this study is in line with this.

Lower overall accuracy of the putamen SBR in the clinical sample relative to the
PPMI sample was mainly driven by reduced sensitivity in the clinical sample (Fig. 4).
Visual inspection of the false-negative clinical SPECT images confirmed the SBR-
based classification in most cases. Thus, most of the false-negative cases in the clin-
ical sample were subjects without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD). Several
studies suggest that the majority of SWEDD patients do not have a neurodegenera-
tive PS [32, 33]. Reduced sensitivity of the putamen SBR in the clinical sample there-
fore most likely was due to clinical overdiagnosis of neurodegenerative PS at clinical
follow-up used as standard of truth in this study [34]. The PPMI sample did not in-
clude SWEDD subjects, as the PPMI handles SWEDD as a separate category, differ-
ent from healthy controls and PD patients (s. PPMI study protocol at http://www.
ppmi-info.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PPMI-AM-13-Protocol.pdf). The lack of
SWEDD patients in the PPMI sample explains the lower sensitivity of the putamen

SBR z-score in the clinical sample at least to some extent. Thus, the findings in the

(normal database comprising all HC subjects or all patients with non-neurodegenerative PS), that is, relative
accuracy loss (%) = 100 * (benchmark accuracy — accuracy) / benchmark accuracy. The maximum accuracy
loss corresponds to the 5th percentile of the accuracy estimates over the 10,000 random samples to
generate the normal database.

clinical sample support the use of a normal database comprised of patients with a
non-neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome. This is practically relevant because
prospective scanning of healthy subjects constitutes a major obstacle at many sites,
particularly in smaller hospitals and private practices.

The findings with respect to the impact of the size of the normal database on classifi-
cation performance were rather independent of the setting, that is, the findings were
very similar for both subject samples (PPMI, clinical), all reconstruction algorithms
(OSEM with and without resolution recovery, filtered backprojection), and both ROI
methods to estimate the SBR (conventional ROI analysis, hottest voxels analysis). Given
that the settings considered here are quite different (Figs. 1, 2, 3), the robustness of the
results with respect to the setting suggests that these findings hold more generally in
the spectrum of settings encountered in clinical routine.

A secondary finding of this study was the skewness of the distribution of the puta-
minal SBR in normal DAT SPECT scans that could be reduced by Ln-transformation
of the SBR values (Fig. 3). Ln-transformation prior to transformation to z-scores im-
proved the classification performance of the putamen SBR (Fig. 6). The improvement of
overall accuracy was mainly driven by improved sensitivity (Fig. 6), most likely due to
avoiding overestimation of the standard deviation of normal SBR from skewed distribu-
tions. The effect of the Ln-transformation was larger for the 5th percentile than for the
average performance over the 10,000 random realizations of the normal database, sug-
gesting that the main benefit from Ln-transformation was stabilization of classification
performance by reducing the impact of potential outliers in the normal database. In
line with this, the decline of the “maximum” performance loss with increasing size of
the normal database was faster with Ln-transformation than without. As a conse-
quence, without Ln-transformation, a larger normal database might be required to reli-
ably achieve the same level of performance of the putamen SBR z-score than with Ln-
transformation. In general, estimates of mean and standard deviation of normal puta-
men SBR derived from the normal database are the more sensitive to outliers the
smaller the database. Thus, careful control of the DAT SPECT images to be included
in the normal database is particularly important in case of a small database.

This study focused on DAT SPECT with FP-CIT. In order to discuss potential
generalizability of the findings, one might hypothesize that univariable binary classifica-
tion of FP-CIT SPECT, that is, differentiation between neurodegenerative and non-
neurodegenerative PS using the putaminal SBR, can be considered a two-sample t-test
with the single subject to be classified comprising one group and the normal database
comprising the other group. Furthermore, the statistical power of testing a given fea-
ture for a mean difference between two groups of different size (71, m2) is approxi-
mately equal to the power of comparing it between two groups of equal size Neg with
Nete = 2* Ny * Nz / (M1, + Nz) [35]. Assuming this equation to be approximately valid also
for the extreme case of single subject comparison against a normal database [36], that
is, 4; = 1 and m2 =n = size of the normal database, it is Neg =2*n/(n+1). The plot of
this relation (Fig. 7) shows that “eg effectively starts to reach its plateau at about n = 10
to n=15. We hypothesize, therefore, that adequate mean accuracy of univariable binary
classification in general requires a normal database of at least 10 to 15 subjects. The
present finding of less than 1% mean loss of accuracy of the putamen SBR z-score
when the normal database included at least 15 subjects is in line with this. Yet, the

variability of the accuracy between different realizations of the normal database can still
vary considerably at this normal database size (comp. Fig. 5b). The number of additional
subjects in the normal database required to achieve adequate stability of the classification
performance between different realizations of the normal database depends on the
between-subjects variability of the feature used for classification as well as on the mean
difference of the feature between disease-positive patients and the normal database (effect
size). The number of additional normal subjects required to achieve stable performance
between different realizations of the normal database, therefore, is expected to depend on
the application. In case of putamen SBR-based classification of FP-CIT SPECT, the num-
ber of additional normal subjects required was 10 to 15 (resulting in a total of 25 to 30
subjects in the normal database).

The following limitations of this study should be noted. First, the comparison of fil-
tered backprojection versus iterative OSEM reconstruction was restricted to the clinical
sample. The PPMI provides only FP-CIT SPECT images reconstructed with OSEM for
download. Raw FP-CIT SPECT projection data for retrospective reconstruction to test
other reconstruction algorithms are not available. Furthermore, the OSEM parameters
differed between the PPMI sample and the clinical sample. In particular, OSEM recon-
struction was performed with resolution recovery in the clinical sample and without in
the PPMI sample. The rationale for this was to increase the heterogeneity among the
tested settings. Second, the whole sample was used as test set in all cases. The rationale
for this was to use the same test set for all sizes of the normal database in order to
avoid bias by varying sizes of the test set. As a consequence, the healthy controls (PPMI
sample) or the patients with non-neurodegenerative PS (clinical sample) randomly se-
lected for the normal database were also included in the test set. This might have re-
sulted in overly optimistic performance estimates. However, the effect is expected to be
small, because the subjects in the normal database represented only a small fraction (<
13.5%) of the test set in all cases. Third, the normal database of the clinical sample was
generated retrospectively from patients who had received FP-CIT SPECT for the etio-
logical diagnosis of a clinically uncertain PS in routine patient care. The clinical diagno-
sis of a non-neurodegenerative etiology (not associated with nigrostriatal degeneration)
as standard of truth was based on the written report of a movement disorder specialist
in the patient’s file after FP-CIT SPECT. The movement disorder specialist was not
blinded for the FP-CIT SPECT findings. This might have caused some bias in favor of
FP-CIT SPECT resulting in overly optimistic performance estimates of the putamen
SBR in the clinical sample. The potential bias is not expected to affect the evaluation of
the impact of the size of the normal database on the performance of the putamen SBR.
Fourth, this study used conversion to z-scores and a fixed, predefined cutoff on the z-
score for SBR-based classification of FP-CIT SPECT. Other methods to define a cutoff
such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis require a database of patients
with nigrostriatal degeneration in addition to a normal database. The impact of the
sizes of the two databases (without and with nigrostriatal degeneration) on SBR classifi-
cation performance using cutoffs derived from ROC analysis might be addressed in fu-
ture studies. Fifth, neither age nor gender were taken into account in this study,
although there is strong evidence for age related decline of striatal DAT availability
[37] and moderate evidence for higher striatal DAT availability in females compared to
males [38—40]. However, so far no studies have been published that clearly demonstrate
Schmitz-Steinkruger et al. EJNMMI Physics (2020) 7:34 Page 13 of 16

that age- and/or gender-correction of the putaminal FP-CIT SBR improves its diagnos-
tic performance [41]. Finally, normal databases of FP-CIT SPECT from healthy control
subjects were used for the PPMI settings, whereas normal databases composed of visu-
ally normal FP-CIT SPECT from patients with non-neurodegenerative PS were used
for the clinical settings. Nevertheless, the present study did not allow testing the impact
of the type of the normal database (healthy control subjects versus patients with Par-
kinsonism but visually normal FP-CIT SPECT) on the performance of semi-
quantitative analysis in FP-CIT SPECT. This would require two normal databases for
the same setting, one comprised of healthy controls, the other comprised of patients

with non-neurodegenerative PS.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that 25 to 30 is the minimum size of the
normal database to reliably achieve good performance of semi-quantitative analysis in
DAT SPECT, independent of the algorithm used for image reconstruction and the ROI
method used to estimate the putaminal SBR. Increasing the size of the normal database
beyond 40 provides only very small further improvement.

Appendix: Other conventional semi-quantitative parameters did not provide
additional information beyond putaminal DAT availability

The following other conventional semi-quantitative parameters were tested for identifi-
cation of patients with neurodegenerative PS in the clinical sample (with filtered back-
projection) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis: minimum of left and
right caudate SBR, minimum of left and right putamen-to-caudate SBR ratio, left-right
asymmetry of putamen SBR (=200*abs (left-right) / (left+right)), and left-right
asymmetry of caudate SBR. The clinical sample was used for this purpose in order to
avoid the ceiling effect in the PPMI sample (due to very good performance of the puta-
minal SBR alone in the PPMI sample).

The area under the ROC curve was significantly smaller for each of the other conven-
tional semi-quantitative parameters than for the (minimum of left and right) putamen
SBR (0.953 + 0.011): 0.932 + 0.012 (DeLong p = 0.017), 0.886 + 0.018 (p < 0.001), 0.824 +
0.023 (p<0.001), and 0.730 + 0.027 (p<0.001) for caudate SBR, putamen-to-caudate
SBR ratio, left-right asymmetry of putamen SBR, and left-right asymmetry of caudate
SBR, respectively.

Discriminant analysis was performed in order to test whether one or more of the other
parameters might provide additional diagnostic information beyond the putamen SBR.

Stepwise discriminant analysis (Wilks’ method, entry p = 0.05, removal p =0.10) did
not include any of the other parameters (p = 0.699, 0.596, 0.226, and 0.341 for caudate
SBR, putamen-to-caudate SBR ratio, left-right asymmetry of putamen SBR, and left-
right asymmetry of caudate SBR, respectively). When the analysis was forced to include
all other parameters, the resulting discriminant function was as follows:

Discriminant function = — 3.741 + 3.200 * putamen SBR + 0.105 * caudate SBR + 0.622 * pu-
tamen-to-caudate ratio — 0.590 * putamen asymmetry / 100 — 0.309 * caudate asymmetry / 100

ROC analysis of the discriminant function revealed exactly the same area under the
ROC curve as for the putamen SBR alone. Thus, there was no evidence that the other

conventional semi-quantitative parameters provide additional information beyond the
Schmitz-Steinkruger et al. EJNMMI Physics (2020) 7:34 Page 14 of 16

putaminal SBR that might improve the performance of semi-quantitative analysis of
FP-CIT SPECT in the clinical sample.

This does not rule out that the other conventional semi-quantitative parameters
might provide additional information beyond the putaminal SBR in other patient sam-
ples, for example, in samples with more borderline cases or a larger fraction of atypical
neurodegenerative PS (multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, cortico-
basal degeneration), or in the differentiation between dementia with Lewy bodies and
Alzheimer’s disease [42].
