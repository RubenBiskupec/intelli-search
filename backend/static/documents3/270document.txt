Introduction

In recent years, with the continuous evolvement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), including Internet-of-Things
(IoT) and cloud computing (CC), computers are anticipated to replace human beings
in almost all fields of life. Smartphones and other handheld devices have evolved from
simple communication devices to personal computers. They have gained popularity due
to their convenient use in everyday life for accessing various online services, social net-
works, and e-banking, etc. People use smartphones for not only personal use but also
take advantage of these devices in their business-related tasks. Consequently, increas-

ing amounts of private and sensitive information are being generated and stored in our

smartphones. According to a study, 92.8% of people use a smartphone to store their pri-
vate information [1, 2]. These smart devices are potentially occupying the center stage
in smart environments. People can easily control their lighting systems, TVs, refrigera-
tors, and doors through their smartphones for easy accessibility. Smartphones have also
been used to control health-related instruments, such as audiovisual aids, thus becom-
ing the focus of the imminent technological paradigm swing. However, incorporating
smartphone-based tracking and control in different systems is leading to severe security
and privacy issues as well. Users are now more hesitant in sharing their smartphones
with others as smartphones have become an attractive target for the attackers to gain
illegal access and control to other smart devices and private information [3, 4]. Hence,
an implicit authentication mechanism is essential for preserving user’s access and con-
trol that has been made accessible through smart devices.

Currently, passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are the most
widely used user identification and access control strategies in smartphone operat-
ing systems. These methods use explicit authentication yet not provide continuous
authentication. There are other explicit authentication mechanisms such as fingerprints
[5], face recognition [6, 7], Iris scanning [8], etc. However, these explicit mechanisms
are not convenient for smartphone users as they require users to participate with the
device. Also, re-authentication actively requires each time users try to access sensitive
private information. Similarly, after an initial login, these mechanisms do not continu-
ously authenticate users again, thus creating a risk for adversaries to access control on
users’ smartphone and act as a legitimate user. Also, password and PINs are vulnerable
to various attacks such as side-channel attacks [9], spoofing [10], and guessing attacks
[11]. Facial recognition using a smartphone camera is another strategy to identify the
actual owner of the smartphone, but it is inconvenient due to the unreliability of the
technique with the changing environment. Also, the frequent image capturing consumes
more power this preventing this technique for continuous authentication use. Similarly,
multiple challenges are associated with camera-based gesture recognition techniques as
it is difficult to collect an ample training set for personalized gestures for existing statis-
tical models such as Hidden Marvok Model (HMM) [12]. A more suitable approach can
be adopted by using smartphones inertial sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and mag-
netometer) to perform user identification, which provides the advantage that recogni-
tion can be done within the device. Thus the power and cost consumptions are lower
[13]. If physical sensors are used, they require some external power source, whereas the
embedded smartphone sensors use the battery as a power source. As a result, the smart-
phone-embedded inertial sensors have stimulated research towards user identifica-
tion by detecting behavioral characteristics [14]. As an example, TapPrints detects user
behavior though sensors data by examining tapping behavior on different locations on
the touch screen [15]. Moreover, the users have their own behavioral patterns to interact
with the device, and the motion sensors assist in characterizing the behavioral pattern to
identify the user. The current work in authenticating smartphone users mainly focuses
on the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Most of these activities consist of longer dura-
tion, which are then segmented to smaller chunks to recognize activities effectively.
But there is a need for exploring strategies that consider the activities of relatively short

duration to authenticate smartphone users.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing the behavioral biometrics
extracted from smartphone inertial sensors for user authentication based on machine
learning. A passive and implicit authentication scheme is proposed, which analyzes the
behavioral patterns of the user when they interact with the smartphone. The user iden-
tification component is based on the recognition of different activities performed by the
users. A total of 12 activities are experimented, which are categorized into two groups:
short-term activities and gestures. Short-term activities are those activities in which a
user uses a smartphone while gestures are those activities which user performs while
holding a smartphone (not actually using the smartphone). Two smartphone sensors,
accelerometer and gyroscope, are used to collect data from different smartphone users
while performing activities. The collected data is pre-processed, and then different time
domain and frequency domain features are extracted. Three different prevalent classi-
fiers i.e., support vector machine, Bayes net, and random forests, are employed for clas-
sification purposes to identify the actual user of the smartphone.

The key contributions of this research work are given below.

ware

The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: “Literature review” section
presents the literature review for smartphone authentication and user identification
schemes. “Proposed methodology” section provides details regarding the proposed
method and its main steps. “Experimental results and analysis” section provides an anal-
ysis of the obtained results and discusses the performance of the selected classifiers for
user identification. Finally, “Conclusion” section concludes this research work and pro-

vides recommendations and suggestions for future works.

Literature review

Traditional smartphone authentication or user identification methods are based on
passwords and PINS for protecting the smartphone user’s privacy [16]. Although they
are widely used authentication mechanisms but choosing the right password is not an
easy task [17]. Similarly, they are weak and vulnerable to guessing attacks [18, 19]. To
avoid the limitations associated with passwords, tokens and hardware keys were adopted
broadly as a second-factor authentication to enhance security [20]. Different physiologi-
cal biometrics approaches used different human features for user identification, such as
fingerprints, iris recognition, face recognition [21]. Fingerprint hardware is embedded
in modern devices and smartphones as a security mechanism. Although this technology
has been used extensively, it cannot be considered definitive. Several research studies
Algarni et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:7 Page 4 of 14

have revealed the vulnerability of fingerprint readers, including spoofing attacks [22].
Also, fingerprints can be altered by molting human fingers. Similarly, fake fingerprints
can be made by using a putty or high-quality scanner. Similar to fingerprint-based meth-
ods, user authentication using face recognition schemes have also been used widely, but
they can be compromised even through simple attacks using a 3D printed mask. Also, a
facial recognition system is susceptible to spoofing attacks that the photo of a legitimate
user can be used to gain access to a system. Face recognition is influenced by lighting
conditions and shelter. Moreover, most of the existing authentication mechanisms for
the smartphone are based on a one-time manner, i.e., once a user is declared as legal, he/
she could be considered as the legitimate user for an extended period of time without
re-verification [23].

Keystroke dynamic based authentication schemes are the oldest ones, introduced to
identify a user as the owner of the device. This method is later adopted in smartphones
as touch strikes. Nader et al. [24] proposed a hybrid authentication scheme based on
touch gestures by combining continuous authentication (CA) and implicit authentica-
tion (IA) schemes. The results were tested using neural network classifier and practical
swarm optimization (PSO)-radial basis function network (RBFN) classifier. The error
rate obtained is 1.9% when only the CA scheme is used and reduces nearly to zero when
combined with the IA scheme. In [25], the authors presented Touchstroke that uses par-
ticipants’s hand movements when holding the smartphone and text-independent 4-digit
touch-type patterns for bimodal verification. The experimental results indicate that the
solution is highly accurate. Similarly, the authors in [26, 27] analyzed the distinctness
of touch dynamics for mobile authentication system. Trojahn et al. [28] proposed an
authentication scheme that is a combination of keystroke and handwriting based mech-
anisms through a touchscreen sensor. They presented their results in terms of the False
Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) as 11% and 16%, respectively. In
[29], the authors proposed a feasibility study based on keystroke analysis, which authen-
ticates a user by examining their typing characteristics. Fang et al. [30] proposed a state-
of-the-art method based on keystrokes dynamics to achieve both FAR and FRR as low
as 1.0% by using three classifiers, including decision trees (J48), Bayesian network, and
random forests. Attaullah et al. [31] presented a method which is a mixture of keystroke
dynamics with inertial measurement unit readings to enhance user recognition capabili-
ties. Gesture-based authentication methods have been used as primary or secondary
security measures for the device. Most of the time, the way of performing gestures is
different, which reflects the user’s distinct behavior. Feng et al. [32] analyzed the gesture
behavior analysis of different users for user authentication and achieved FAR below 5%
and FRR as 0.13%. Frenk et al. [33] identified a user via distinct analytic features from
sliding traces and achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4%.

Nowadays, the analysis of behavioral patterns has widely been used in implicit and
continuous authentication. These methods have improved the accuracy in identify-
ing and verifying users based on their activity patterns. In this regard, an authen-
tication scheme has been proposed by Conti et al. [34], which authenticates a user
based on the hand movements when he tries to answer or place a call. They ana-
lyzed accelerometer and orientation sensors data and achieved and 4.4% FAR and
9.3% FRR. In [35], the authors proposed an authentication scheme that validates a
Algarni et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:7 Page 5 of 14

user continuously and unobtrusively based on his/her interactions with the user
interface of the mobile application. The proposed scheme is tested using a support
vector machine-based ensemble classifier that achieved an EER of 7% and a median
accuracy of 93%. In [36], the authors presented a framework that identifies user con-
tinuously from remote servers by analyzing user interactions with the smartphone.
The obtained results showed FAR and FRR of 23% and 22%, respectively in the case
of a single scroll gesture. In [37], the authors utilized neural networks and extreme
value analysis for implementing a gait recognition-based fuzzy authentication sys-
tem. Sensec [38] presented a sensor-based user authentication model by collecting
data from three smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
The data was based on the gestures model developed when the users were interacting
with the device. Their approach showed 75% accuracy in identifying users. Amin et al.
[39] presented an implicit authentication scheme for smartphone user authentication
based on built-in sensors of the device. The experimental analysis shows an accuracy
of 96.5%. In [40], the authors recognize the touchscreen interactions based on web
browsing for authenticating smartphone users. Nickle et al. [41] recognize the user’s
behavior patterns and to authenticate smartphone user. They used accelerometer data
and used the k-nearest neighbor classifier to obtain FAR of 3.97% and FRR of 22.22%.
Lee et al. [42] analyzed the user’s daily living activities and showed that using more
sensors can significantly improve the accuracy of the authentication scheme. Their
results showed an accuracy of 90% when support vector machine classifier was used.
A system proposed by Yang et al. [43] utilizes the accelerometer data of the hand wav-
ing pattern when used for locking and unlocking of the smartphone, which achieved
FAR of 15% and FRR of 10%. The existing work mainly focuses on the activities of
daily living or utilizes only single behavioral biometric for authentication. However,
this study uses a fair number of short-term activities and gestures for user identifica-

tion, which is performed by the participants when interacting with their smartphones.

Dataset description

Stimuli

The dataset includes smartphone data when different types of activities are performed
by participants. The activities considered are those which define the user interaction
with the device, thus making it suitable for identifying smartphone users. The dataset
encompasses a total of 12 activities, which are divided further into two groups, namely
short-term activities and gestures. Short-term activities can be defined as those activities
which are performed while the user is using the smartphone. They are named as short-
term activities because their duration of performing a single trail is relatively short as
compared to the most commonly used ADLs. The activities that fall into the category
of gestures represent some specific type of gestures performed by the user while hold-
ing a smartphone in hand. The graphical representation of these gestures is presented in
Fig. 2. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the necessary details related to all the captured activi-

ties with their time duration in seconds.

Dataset acquisition protocol

The dataset for smartphone user identification was collected at the University of Engi-
neering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan. The experiments were performed in a con-
trolled environment of video and image processing lab in the Computer Engineering
department. The lab was dedicated to data collection purpose and kept free from

external interruptions. The users were provided with a chair to sit and perform the
selected activities. Data were recorded from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
of the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus smartphone. The gyroscope was calibrated prior to data
recording using the device's integrated tool. An existing android application, “Linear-
DataCollector,’ was used for raw data acquisition of the smartphone sensors at the sam-
pling rate of 50 Hz. The application can be downloaded from the following link: https://
www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/ps/research/dataset/. For each sample, the timestamp value
was recorded along with the sensor’s values for segmentation purposes. The subjects
were asked to perform activities in sequential order with 05 trials of each activity, where
the gestures were performed, followed by the selected short-term activities. After per-
forming all trials of one activity, the users were asked to take rest for the 1-min duration
before performing the next activity. In this way, approximately 25-30 min were taken by
each user in the completion of his/her experimental study.

Participants

For dataset generation, 26 participants (14 male and 12 female) from the same depart-
ment have voluntarily recorded their data when performing the predefined activities.
The average age of the participants was 21 years, with a standard deviation of 03 years.
Neither of the participants was forced to perform activities in a specific position. All the

participants have successfully completed their experiment.

Data pre-processing

The data acquired from smartphone sensors are affected by noise due to the unnecessary
participant motion or sudden device movements. Before further processing of the sen-
sory data, it is essential to minimize unwanted noise from the data to produce accurate
results. Hence, the accelerometer and gyroscope data were passed through an average
smoothing filter for signal denoising. The duration of all activities is less than 5 s except
for S3 and S4 activities, so only these two activities were segmented when required. If
the duration of these two activities is higher than 4 s, then filtered data of these activities

is further divided into smaller chunks of 4s.

Feature extraction
The filtered data can further be used for feature extraction. Several commonly used

features from the existing studies [44—46] were selected to test the proposed scheme

Overall, eighteen (18) different features were extracted, where the size of the final feature
vector obtained was [1 x 145], containing all the extracted features on three dimensions,

i.e., x, y, and z, of the accelerometer and gyroscope.

User Identification

To identify smartphone users based on their interaction with a smartphone, three prev-
alent classifiers Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Bayes Net
(BN) were used. The classifiers were selected because of their frequent use and excel-
lent performance in the existing studies. The activities performed by the user were clas-

sified into different groups, where the identified activity patterns were used for user
Algarni et al. Hum. Cent. Comput. Inf. Sci. (2020) 10:7 Page 9 of 14

classification. A detailed experimental analysis was conducted to test the performance of
three different classifiers for the proposed scheme.

Experimental results and analysis
This section depicts the results of the performed experiments to explore whether the
collected measurements can be used for user authentication or not. The results are

presented separately for two different groups of activities.

Classification methods

According to the dataset, the user authentication is a multi-class classification prob-
lem. Three commonly used machine learning algorithms, including SVM, RF, and
BN, are considered for training and testing purposes. A cross-validation method with
k-folds is applied to the dataset where k is set equal to 10. The activities performed by
the user were labeled, and the user who performed those activities was also labeled.
The training and testing procedure has been applied for each activity. For SVM, the
linear algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization was used.

Performance metrics

For evaluating the performance of the proposed scheme, four different performance
metrics have been used, which include: accuracy, F-measure, kappa statistic, and Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE). Kappa statistic is a statistical measure that is independ-
ent of total classes. In kappa statistic, when k, = 0, it means that there is a chance-
level classification. If the value of ky, increases from zero and reaches to 1, it then
represents perfect classification. In contrast, the value of k, going below zero repre-
sents that the result of classification is poorer than the chance-level classification.

User Identification based on Short-term Activities
This section shows the identification performance of the short-term activities that
participants performed when they were using the smartphone. Table 4 represents
the detailed user identification results for activities $1—-S5. The highest accuracy is
achieved in the case of $3 activity by RF classifier, which is the keystroke pattern. It
means that most of the users are correctly identified based on their keystroke pat-
terns. The highest average accuracy is achieved by the RF classifier, which is 63.72%,
and the worst accuracy is achieved by BN classifier, i.e., 47.61%.

Figure 3 provides a comparison of the average accuracy rate obtained for user iden-
tification based on short-term activities using SVM, RF, and BN classifier. It can be
observed from the figure that for most of the activities, RF classifier provides better

performance than SVM and BN classifiers.

User identification based on hand gestures
This section represents the user identification performance of the hand gestures
performed by the user when holding the smartphone in hand. The inertial sensors
were recording data unobtrusively, which is used for identifying smartphone users.
Table 5 shows the user recognition results for activities G1—G7. The highest accuracy
is achieved in the case of G6 and G7, which represent “right hand draw circle” and
“right hand draw triangle” gesture, respectively. The accuracy of SVM and RF classifi-
ers is the same for these two gestures. However, the overall average accuracy is higher
in the case of RF, which is 74.97% for all the gestures. The worst classification results
were obtained using the BN classifier with an average accuracy of 64.38%. Figure 4
compares of the average accuracy rate obtained for user identification based on hand
gestures using SVM, RF, and BN classifier, which show that RF classifier outperforms
SVM and BN classifiers in most of the cases.

The average accuracy rate (i.e., 74.97%) of the RF classifier is the highest among all
three classifiers in identifying the smartphone user. SVM has the second-best perfor-
mance with a 74.78% accuracy rate, and the worst recognition accuracy of 64.38% is

obtained for the BN classifier. Figure 5 shows the overall average accuracy for user iden-
tification based on all the selected activities using RF classifier. The results demonstrate
that the average accuracy is higher in the case of gestures as compare to short-term
activities performed by the user. This is because while performing the gesture, the user

makes frequent movements that assist in recognizing every user and distinguish them

well. Hence, based on the overall results, the proposed scheme provides a viable solution

for smartphone user identification.

Conclusion

In this paper, a passive and implicit smartphone user identification scheme is proposed
for smartphone security, which is purely based on the behavioral biometrics of the user,
i.e., how a user interacts with his/her device. A set of 12 different activities have been
used for experimentation purpose, which is divided into two groups, named as short-
term activities and gestures. The experimental results for user identification based on
short-term activities revealed that the best performance is achieved by RF classifier in
the case of keystroke pattern activity. Similarly, in the case of gestures, the best authen-
tication results were also obtained using the RF classifier. The overall average recogni-
tion results are better in the case of gestures as compare to short-term activities because
the user performs more frequent actions when performing gestures. For future work,
the accuracy can be significantly improved by using a large dataset with more sensors.
Feature selection methods can also be applied to enhance the recognition performance
as well. Similarly, the effects of temporal and permanent behavioral changes need to
be considered in order to test the identification accuracy. Open-set recognition can be
applied to classify between a valid and invalid set of activities. In the same way, the clas-
sification between impostors and an authenticated user can be performed to achieve
smartphone authentication. Wearable sensors can be used to identify a user based on

the way how he/she interacts with an object.
