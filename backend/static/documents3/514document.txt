ABSTRACT

The accuracy of keyword extraction is a leading factor in information
retrieval systems and marketing. In the real world, text is produced in
a variety of languages, and the ability to extract keywords based on
information from different languages improves the accuracy of keyword
extraction. In this paper, the available information of all languages is applied
to improve a traditional keyword extraction algorithm from a multilingual
text. The proposed keywork extraction procedure is an unsupervise algorithm
and designed based on selecting a word as a keyword of a given text, if in
addition to that language holds a high rank based on the keywords criteria in
other languages, as well. To achieve to this aim, the average TF-IDF of
the candidate words were calculated for the same and the other languages.
Then the words with the higher averages TF-IDF were chosen as
the extracted keywords. The obtained results indicat that the algorithms’
accuracis of the multilingual texts in term frequency-inverse document
frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, graph-based algorithm, and the improved

proposed algorithm are 80, 60.65, and 91.3%, respectively.

1. INTRODUCTION

Designing data retrieval systems of large databases is one of the research areas for the application of
information technology in the information business. We faced an increasing demand for types of data
retrieval systems able to cross the interlingual boundaries, while text data expands in different languages and
on the web [1-6]. Therefore, by developing the volume of electronic data in various languages, the data
retrieval, independent of document languages, has gained importance. The extraction of effective keywords is
a time-consuming and human-processing task. Recently, automatic keyword extraction, especially keyword
extraction in different languages, introduced an interesting topic for text mining and data retrieval [7-9].

The fields of text mining and information retrieval and especially their implementation on
the database is of particular importance. The first step is to identify and extract keywords from the texts in
the fields. One of the main challenges to extract keywords is existing very diverse languages for contextual
information and depending the available keyword extraction methods on the language’s type and its verbal
structure. The multilingual keywords extraction is the current research problem and the research object is
considered based on designing an unsupervised language-independent algorithm to the extraction. So, it is
done by focusing on the property of repeating keywords in each text and their intensifying in other texts by
utilizing the TF-IDF algorithm.

The rest of the current paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the state-of-the-art keywords
extraction methods. The problem of keywords extraction descrids in Section 3. The proposed language

independent keywords extraction algorithm and its experimental results are discussed in Section 4 and
Section 5. Finally, a conclusion and recommendations are described in section 6.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW

Several methods were proposed so far for the identification and extraction of keywords, all of which
could be classified into two groups of supervised and unsupervised methods [10-12]. In the following,
we discuss shortly about the proposed methods to realize the probable research challenges. The first group is
the supervised methods. In this group, there is a training data set, by learning of which a model is designed
and by incorporating this model on new document the phrases will divided into two classes of key and
non-key phrases.

The supervised method of word extraction is considered as a clustering problem, which should be
trained like a genetic algorithm [13, 14]. In Bayes linear algorithm, which is called a keyphrase extraction
algorithm (KEA) and proposed by [15], TF-IDF and keyphrase relative distance from the beginning of
the text are two algorithm inputs [16]. They also used a binary clustering algorithm that its input features
include some references to the text. Decision tree of [17], conditional random field of [18], and a type of
KEA in [19] are among other types of supervised word extraction. The functionality of this method is highly
dependent on training data and lack of such high quality data could cause an efficiency drop in the system of
keyphrase extraction. In this method, the designed model is specific to a domain and works based on
the domain of usage.

Another approach to extracting keywords is through unsupervised methods. In these methods,
word extraction is dealt with as a ranking issue [20], the most important of which is the TF-IDF. In this
method, the relation between the number of a word repetition within a text is calculated according to
the number of its repletion in other texts [21]. Graph-based methods are also among the unsupervised
methods [22]. The works of [22-24] are examples of graph-based methods for word extraction.
In unsupervised methods, there is no need for training data and the most important contextual phrases could
be extracted by using the ranking strategies. Unlike the supervised methods, the unsupervised methods are
applicable for each text to any domain type independent of domain of usage. By the qualitative analysis and
comparison of the proposed methods several advantages and disadvantages were found, which could be
noted as follows.

The first advantage of the unsupervised methods is their applications in constructing models of any
text type and domain. No efficiency drops in case of existence of poor quality data, independently of training
data, lower time consumption for keyword extraction, compared with the supervised methods,
useful functionality for high-volume data, and high accuracy are among the advantages of the unsupervised
methods. In contrast to these advantages, low compatibility is the most tangible shortcoming of these
methods. As mentioned previously, there are some disadvantages/advantages of the supervised methods,
among which we could refer to the existence of training data with the quality of regular data categorization.
However, one of the significant shortcomings of this method is that it is dependent on the training data and
lack high-quality data could lead to an efficiency drop of the keyword extraction system, the constructed
model is for one domain only, and it acts based on the domain of usage. Providing training data is
a time-consuming and laborious task. Moreover, evaluations which are made based on frequency are not
applying for high-volume data. One of the challenges of such a method is that providing training data is
time-consuming and if such data are not available, the algorithm faces problems and has low efficiency, but it
is not the case in the unsupervised method [1,3]. Hence, we employ this method for the proposed algorithm.

Despite the simplicity, TF-IDF algorithm is one of the effective methods for keyword
extraction [16, 25]. The practical simplicity and efficiency of this algorithm has attracted a considerable
attention. A logarithm is proposed for word extraction in the present study to improve TF-IDF. This method
is based on TF-IDF, but uses the information of each text in several languages to enhance keyword extraction
based on TF-IDF. To implement such an objective, we concentrated on the repetition of words in the context
and deleted the conjunctions, prepositions, and verbs. Further, we used simultaneous multilingual
information for a certain text, to improve its usage. This process is elucidated in details in the following.

3. PROBLEM DISCRIPTION OF KEYWORDS EXTRACTION

Data retrieval is used extensively in the everyday life of people. Enhancing efficiency and
improving performance is of great importance for the designers of data retrieval systems. As mentioned
previously, one way to increase the productivity of data retrieval systems is through the use of statistical
plans. In these plans, a frequency is set of keywords, based on which words with the highest frequency are
selected as keywords.

Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 10, No. 6, December 2020 : 5909 - 5916

In aim of the present study was to propose an algorithm, which has the required features, including
non-supervisory, language-independent, simplicity, and high speed for processing considerable amount of
data. By using the proposed algorithm along with the TF-IDF, which is a statistical, simple, language
independent and non-supervisory algorithm, by relying on a sequence of calls with Unicode format, and by
designing an online database keyword could be extracted independently of language in large databases.

By assessing the applications of data retrieval and text mining, we could realize that existing
keywords within a text play a significant role and facilitate the process in this field. For example, by finding
important words in the news and by detecting sentences with more important words, we could extract that
sentence in the abstract and better comprehend the text. Since important words are often in headings and
important sections, by realizing the structure of a text and by extracting keywords out of these parts, we could
get access to these words with a minimum of time. Feed or RSS is used for reading news, which make a news
extract available in a structured way by XML format. News reading and saving template are Unicode.
For extracting keywords of news texts, we need websites with proper and authentic feed addresses.
Hence, we select those feeds, which provide appropriate information. These feeds, however, are selected for
every language. After calling information from feeds, they will be saved in a database. Some words are
available with high frequency in all texts with no contextual value, like pronouns, adverbs, prepositions,
conjunctions, and some frequent verbs. These elements are called public words. By omitting the public words
in statistical text mining, we have less calculations and higher efficiency. Words take an equal weight based
on their frequency in the document. Actually, this weighting system shows how much a word is important for
a document. This fact has no functionality in data retrieval. The weight of a word in a text increases by
the number of repetitions in that text, but it is controlled by the number of words in the text. This method is
an unsupervised one, which is applied to a simple text. In contrast to the supervised methods, this method
does not need the training dataset, in that proving an appropriate training data is a time-consuming and not an
easy task and in case the data lack the desired quality, they reduce the efficiency of the supervised keyword
extraction system.

Figure 1. The overall structure of the proposed algorithm

Step 1 (selecting feeds and retrieval): in order to gain access to various documents of different
languages, we tried to select the appropriate feeds. Data retrieval of each document, like title or
body is carried out in this step. Since our algorithm is language independent, information is read by
the unicode format. Step 2 (saving document information in the large database): the read information is
stored in the database, separately. Data are stored in the Unicode format. This format covers most of

the languages. Step 3 (word extraction): all words are extracted from the text and omitted in the step
related to this action. Every language has a list of repetitive words, which should be deleted from
the extracted words.

Step 4 (TF-IDF calculations): TF-IDF calculations are carried out in the step for every text and
language and finally the calculated TF-IDF of each text in a different language is used for improving
the keywords. In this method, each word has a frequency-based weight in the document. Actually,
such weighting system shows how much a word is important for a particular document. This process is used
frequently in data retrieval. The weight of a word is increased by the increase of its repetition in a certain
text, but is controlled by the number of words in the context, because if the text is lengthy some words would
be repeated, naturally, though they do not have any significance in the meaning. Term frequency is a criterion
for the range of common and repetitive words in a text, which is calculated as follows:

_ f(t.d)
TF(f,d) = 0.5 + 0.5 x (1)

where in the numerator, d is the number of words in the selected text. w is the most frequent words in
the selected text.

IDF (inverse document Frequency) is a criterion for the range of the most frequent and repetitive
words. This criterion is achieved by dividing the total number of texts in the number of texts including
the common word. For example: suppose that there are 1000 texts in the whole databases. If there is a certain
word in all of them (like, is) the result of an algorithm is 1000 divided by 1000, which is 0, that is, this word
is among the common words and must be taken the coefficient of 0. However, if the repetition is occurred in
500 texts, the result is 1 and takes the coefficient of 1. The more the repetition of a word, the less is the IDF
weight. In case a word has no repetition and dominator becomes 0, we put +1 in dominator, which is
calculated through second formula:

D
1+{deD:tEed}

IDF (t, D) = log( ) (2)

where, D is the number of existing texts in the numerator and the number of texts bearing the word in
the dominator. The TF-IDF is calculated through formula (3) as follows:

TF_IDF(t,d,D) = TF(t,d) * IDF(t,D) (3)

Step 5 (saving calculations in the database): the performed calculations are saved in the database by
TF-IDF algorithm. Step 6 (improving the extraction of the proposed TF-IDF): in the conventional TF-IDF,
in a text in a certain language, words with the highest frequency of TF-IDF are considered as keywords in
that text with the same language. However, in the proposed method, words are called keywords if their
averages TF-IDF are high for that text with the same language and other languages. Therefore, the average
TF-IDF is considered for a text with the same language and other languages and instead of using TF-IDF of
a text in a language, its average TF-IDF is used in available languages. This simple, but useful method could
improve the extraction of keywords, significantly. In this paper, average and maximum TF-IDF method for
a text in different languages is also tested, the result of which outweighed the conventional one. However,
the method, which calculates the average TF-IDF has the highest accuracy.

Step 7 (depicting results): this step shows those keywords, which were extracted by TF-IDF
improved algorithm. Step 8 (evaluating the accuracy rate): in this step, the keyword extraction accuracy of
the algorithm is calculated through the following formula:

No.of correct extracted words

Accuracy rate = x 100 (4)

total no.of words extracted as keywords

where, the number of correct extracted keywords are those words, which are common between actual
keywords and the extracted one by the algorithm. The dominator is also the total number of extracted words
by the algorithm as a keyword.

The pseudo-code of the proposed keywords extraction algorithm is presented in Figure 2.
The algorithm is unsupervised and could be run on the simple text. It means that unlike supervised keyword
extraction algorithms, there is no need for appropriate training data sets. As known as, providing appropriate
training data is time consuming and difficult. If the data is not of good quality, it will lead to a decline in
the efficiency of the supervised keyword extraction algorithms.

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The proposed algorithm was programed in SQL Server 2012 and Visual Studio 2013 and
simulations were performed on the Intel Core 15, 64 B, CPU 2.50 GHz and RAM 21 GB. The database used
for evaluating the efficiency and performance of the proposed keyword extraction algorithm has been an
online dataset containing 200 news collected from BBC website in various languages. Each news is in eight
languages. The reason for using such a dataset was to provide updated information, which are processed at
the same time. The proposed method is assessed by counting the number of matching between extracted
keywords by the proposed method and given keywords.

5.1. The results of the proposed algorithm

An algorithm is designed in this study, which is language independent and has a simple structure.
In contract to language-dependent algorithms (like [26]), which are using the Persian roots for keyword
extraction, this algorithm is simply functional for large databases in every language. In the TF-IDF algorithm,
high-frequency words in a text, but in all languages (TF-IDF mean in all languages) were selected as
keywords and the accuracy of the algorithm, considering the text in various languages is improved.
It is noteworthy that in a text, non-keywords, including verbs and prepositions are repeated, considerably,
so, we set all non-keywords a side at the very beginning. The proposed algorithm is applicable to all
multilingual websites and here the results were shown just on BBC News Website. The database used is
comprised of 200 news collected from BBC Website in eight languages (a total of 1600 news). As can be
seen in Table 1, words with relatively high TF-IDF (here TF-IDF more than 20) were considered, while in
the conventional TF-IDF algorithm, in every language, those independent words with highest TF-IDF value
is counted as keywords. As can be seen in Table 2, in Persian language, the word “America” is detected as
a keyword (in thickened Table 2 mistakenly, while in English language, three words of “America, England,
and London” (in thickened Table 2 were mistakenly detected as a keyword. In other languages, two or three
keywords were also known as keywords, mistakenly.

Table 3 illustrates the proposed algorithm results for the selected text. As can be seen in the table,
the mean TF-IDF is calculated in eight languages (the proposed algorithm) for each word depicted in Table 1
and seven keywords were selected. The selected keywords in this method are considered for all eight
languages, such that for all languages in this text, keywords in the mean method, which are shown in Table 3
include Quds, Zionist, America, demonstration, people, Palestine, and Iran, in which America is detected
mistakenly as a keyword for all languages. However, as we mentioned in Table 2, in the conventional
TF-IDF method the number of wrong detected keywords is different and more than one word for most
languages. If we evaluate the accuracy of mean TF-IDF algorithm (the proposed one) and that of
the conventional algorithm, the conventional algorithm (which is shown in Table 2) 6 of 7 Persian words,
4 of 7 English words, and 3 of 7 Arabic words, as well as other words in other languages were detected,
correctly. In total, in 8 languages and among 56-7*8 correct keywords, 39 were detected correctly and
the accuracy of the algorithm is 0.69=39/56, while in the mean TF-IDF method, 6 of 7 words were detected
correctly for all languages and the accuracy of the algorithm is 0.85=6/7. This is the case of the mean and
maximum method.

5.2. The comparison of the obtained results with the other related algorithms

To evaluate the efficiency and performance, the rate of accuracy of the proposed algorithm is
compared with that of the other methods. The algorithm was tested with 200 texts in eight languages,
which are shown in Table 1, and 1200 correct keywords were achieved. The rate of accuracy of
the conventional TF-IDF algorithm for 1014 correct words and 1672 obtained keywords is 60.6%,
while the proposed algorithm, namely the mean. TF-IDF, for 1164 correct words of 1275 words, the rate is
91.3%. In the proposed algorithm with the median method, 1092 correct words of 1456 words indicate
the rate of 75%. Moreover, if we calculate the accuracy rate for the maximum method, 1021 correct words of
1531 words by the accuracy rate of 66.6% is obtained. The rate of accuracy for graph-based algorithm [27]
for these data is 80%. Concerning the obtained rates, mean with the accuracy rate of 91.3% is the best
method. Table 4 shows the summary of results on BBC data. This suggests that the proposed algorithm not
only extracted the keywords language independent, but has achieved a considerably better results. Table 5
shows comparison the algorithm with other related algorithms.

6. CONCLUSION

Data retrieval is widely applied in everyday life. Increasing the efficiency and performance of
information retrieval systems is very important for their designers. We realized based on investigating
the applications of the data retrieval and text mining that the keywords of a text are important and facilitate
the oriantations of the processes. For example, by finding the keywords in the news or some sentences with
more keywords, we could summarize or comprehend the text more easily. To achieve to this aim,
an unsupervised keywords extraction algorithm is proposed based on improving the TF-IDF algorithm for
multi-language texts. In the proposed algorithm, the average TF-IDF of the candidate words were calculated
for the same and the other languages. Then the words with the higher averages TF-IDF were chosen as
the extracted keywords. A database, which was collected 200 news from BBC website in various languages,
was considered to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that
the selected keywords are more similar to the mentioned keywords by the website and this confirms
the reliability of the algorithm. The overall accuracy rate of the algorithm is 91.3% that it is higher than
the state-of-the-art keyword extraction algorithms. We would like to introduce three strategies as our future
works, to improve the proposed algorithm in application, complexity and time. Finding complex keywords
could be added to the algorithm, real-time and on-line behaviour could be created by focusing on parallel
processing and normalizing the feeds’ addresses could be considered to facilitate access.
