: We have made available a database of over 1 billion compounds predicted to be easily synthesizable,

called Synthetically Accessible Virtual Inventory (SAVI). They have been created by a set of

transforms based on an adaptation and extension of the CHMTRN/PATRAN programming languages
: describing chemical synthesis expert knowledge, which originally stem from the LHASA project. The
: chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS was used to apply a total of 53 transforms to about 150,000 readily

available building blocks (enamine.net). Only single-step, two-reactant syntheses were calculated

for this database even though the technology can execute multi-step reactions. The possibility to

incorporate scoring systems in CHMTRN allowed us to subdivide the database of 1.75 billion compounds
in sets according to their predicted synthesizability, with the most-synthesizable class comprising 1.09
billion synthetic products. Properties calculated for all SAVI products show that the database should

be well-suited for drug discovery. It is being made publicly available for free download from https://doi.

Background & Summary

: Insilico screening of large databases of existing screening samples for the purpose of computer-aided drug design
: has made significant strides in the recent past, both in terms of the methodologies available and the size and

diversity of screening sample collections. Aggregated libraries on the order of 100 million on-the-shelf unique
compounds are available in the commercial market’. Still, this represents only a microscopically small fraction

: of the drug-like small-molecule space, estimated to be on the order of 107! to 10° possible structures or even
: larger’.

Computational tools have been developed over the past four decades to help the synthetic chemists (and/or

: their CADD colleagues) find a viable synthetic route for a novel molecule. They can be broadly categorized into
: two classes: synthesizability estimation®'’; and synthetic route prediction (variously called computer assisted

synthesis design (CASD), computer-assisted organic synthesis (CAOS), computer-assisted synthesis planning
(CASP), or computer-assisted reaction design (CARD))'**’. These tools had their heyday during the 1980s and
1990s but subsequently fell out of favor as an approach used in practice, and the entire field went essentially

: dormant fora good decade until the field experienced a revival of sorts in the 2010s.

Most importantly in our context, however, these approaches were all retrosynthetic in nature, i.e. trying to

: answer the question for a given molecule, “can it be synthesized?” or “how do I make it?” It seemed reasonable to
: turn this question on its head and instead ask: “what can we easily and cheaply synthesize?” and only then “go fish-

ing” (with all the modern CADD approaches) for bioactive compounds in such a large pool of easy-to-synthesize

: molecules. The forward-synthetic approach started up nearly as early with tools such as AHMOS, CAMEO,

AIPHOS etc.**-*’. With this approach, one can for example a priori limit the number of reaction steps to just one,
i.e. the simplest possible chemistry. The central point of SAVI is to avoid any synthetic heroics. Likewise, by giving
the task of creating new molecules to the computer, one may reduce anthropogenic biases in chemical reaction
choices“, thus hopefully covering chemical space better.

Three main components are required to make such an approach successful: (1) A set of highly predictive and
richly annotated rules; (2) a significant-size database of reliably available and inexpensive starting materials; (3) a
chemoinformatics engine capable of combining (1) and (2) to create a large number of molecules, each annotated
with a proposed synthetic route description as well as with predicted properties seen as important in contempo-
rary cutting-edge drug design.

A set of rules was published by Hartenfeller et al.*, presenting robust organic synthesis reactions, encoded as
SMIRKS patterns, that could be useful for in silico compound design. SMIRKS patterns, however, do not contain,
and cannot easily be annotated with, any algorithmically usable chemistry knowledge for the reaction’s successful
application in the laboratory. See below for more discussion of SMIRKS-based approaches. We therefore tapped
into the source of synthetic transform knowledge with arguably the richest description of the chemical context
for each reaction: the knowledgebase that underlies the computational embodiment of E.J. Corey’s seminal work
on retrosynthetic analysis, the program LHASA (Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic Analysis)'**°~°. A
thorough review of knowledge-based expert systems in chemistry has been recently published”’.

While LHASA is retrosynthetic, SAVI is strictly forward-synthetic. This implied the task to make LHASA trans-
forms, which are written for retrosynthetic application, work in a forward-synthetic context. (A forward-synthetic
application of the LHASA rules, LCOLI, was reported in the early 2000s” but does not seem to have progressed to
any widely used tool.)

The active development of the LHASA knowledgebase essentially ceased in the late 1990s. Chemistries such
as the Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reactions that are widely used nowadays were thus
not represented in the LHASA knowledgebase at the beginning of the SAVI project. We have therefore created
novel transforms for such (more) modern chemistry.

After posting for free download an early alpha set (610,492 products) in 2015°° and subsequently a beta set of
the SAVI database comprising over 283 million structures in 2016, we are presenting here description and analy-
sis of a data set of over 1 billion SAVI products”. We point out that SAVI is an ongoing project, i.e. the approach
and data described here are a snapshot of its current state.

Methods

Transforms. Language pair CHMTRN/PATRAN for encoding transforms. The rules are written in the
twin programming languages called CHMTRN and PATRAN originally developed in the LHASA project***”.
CHMTRN is probably best described as a hybrid of FORTRAN style programming with numerous buzz words
providing a natural-language-like representation of detailed synthetic chemistry knowledge. It is used together
with PATRAN, a chemical pattern description language. CHMTRN/PATRAN surpass other reaction transform
descriptions such as SMIRKS in several respects: (1) Structural features that may be important for the reaction but
are remote from the reaction center can be described and tested for (such as “a hydroxyl group within two atoms
of one of the reaction center atoms”); (2) control and conditional functionality (such as “if... then.. else”, and
“for each”) and subroutine usage are possible; (3) tests for structural elements other than atoms and bonds, e.g.
physico-chemical properties (such as electrophilic localization energy) can be implemented; (4) scoring systems
can be implemented.

The rules can employ a scoring system that is based on molecular structural features, which can either facilitate
the reaction (e.g., increase the predicted yield), or impede it. The syntactic elements that increase the transform’s
baseline score are the so-called ADD statements, and the SUBTRACT statements as their obvious counterpart. A
third, related, syntactic element that is available if the author of a rule deems that structural features would make
the reaction entirely unlikely to succeed is the KILL statement, whose meaning and effect is obvious. ADD and
SUBTRACT values have traditionally been assigned in increments of five, and typically range from 5 to 30. In
spite of their quantitative appearance, they are essentially qualitative human assessments.

We have adopted and extended the CHMTRN language for use in the SAVI project. CHMTRN/PATRAN,
originally created for the design of retrosynthetic routes, have been re-implemented for the forward-synthetic
SAVI project, but remain able to describe retro-, as well as forward, reactions. For any further explanations of
these languages including their detailed syntax, we refer to a recent publication”.

Existing transform sets. The original LHASA knowledgebase in its entirety comprises about 2,300 transforms.
We obtained all transforms from the two organizations that maintain it, the non-profit Lhasa Ltd in the UK
(Leeds), and the small company LHASA LLC in the US (Cambridge, MA). The entire set is split roughly into
1,000 basic rules for retrosynthesis planning maintained by the latter company, and 1,300 more-complex rules
held, and recently made public’, by the former.

While a large number of transforms may give power to a retrosynthetic tool - which after all is intended to
provide synthetic route suggestions for any molecule a user may submit — this is entirely unnecessary and was in
fact undesirable at the inception of SAVI as we were looking for well-established chemistries that are easy, reliable,
safe, high-yield etc. We therefore initially chose just over ten transforms from the knowledgebase with an empha-
sis on ring-forming reactions (Table 1), as well as to provide a test set for implementation of the CHMTRN/
PATRAN parser, development of the SAVI algorithms, and initial proof of principle of the feasibility of the entire
approach. We used the internal quality annotations in the transforms (such as TYPICAL* YIELD, RELIABILITY,
CONDITION* FLEXIBILITY etc.) to filter for overall “good” transforms.

New transforms. Due to the age of the existing knowledgebase, it did not contain several named reactions
that are widely used nowadays, such as Suzukia-Miyaura Cross-Coupling. We therefore created over fifty novel
CHMTRN/PATRAN transforms (Table 2).

We focused on transforms that create novel molecules by making significant new bonds, some of which
encode ring-forming reactions. In the SAVI production runs that created the data described here we did not use
functional group interchange (FGI) transforms, including the newly written Balz-Schiemann Fluorination (ID
6030) and Nitro Reduction to Primary Amine (ID 6040), which have significant expansion potential, being appli-
cable to 96,314,519 and 89,415,518 of the 1.75 billion SAVI products, respectively. They, and potentially other
FGI transforms from the original LHASA transform set, may be used for future broadening of the SAVI database.

The general reaction scheme of SAV] in its current version is thus A+ B — C (A, B: reactants; C: product) as
we have limited the project to single-step application of transforms.

All newly created transforms have however been coded such that they could directly be used in a retrosyn-
thetic way, ie. should the LHASA program be reactivated, or a successor retrosynthetic tool be created.

Chemoinformatics parsing of CHMTRN/PATRAN rules and computation of reactions. While
CHMTRN/PATRAN was not publicly documented at the beginning of the project, we received sufficient docu-
mentation material from the original providers of the transforms to be able to implement a parser and bytecode
interpreter, augmented with additional, connected program logic in the chemoinformatics toolkit CACT VS°®
(Xemistry GmbH, Glashiitten, Germany, https://www.xemistry.com/) for at least a subset of these rules. Details of
this work will be published elsewhere. We have now provided a description of the CHMTRN language”.

An important aspect of design and implementation of the CHMTRN/PATRAN parser and the SAVI algorithm
based on it is that, as already mentioned, the knowledgebase rules were all written for retrosynthetic application,
whereas the SAVI project is forward-synthetic. Since we preserved compatibility of newly written transforms with
the original retrosynthetic approach, this required a somewhat indirect traversal of the actual rule by first enu-
merating all possible reactant pairs (if dealing with a two-reactant transform), then testing in a first pass whether
the “Ihasa react” command in CACTVS produces a possible product, and only then subjecting this (tentative)
product to the retrosynthetic analysis of the rule proper (including possibly encountering the above-mentioned
ADD, SUBTRACT, or KILL clauses), executed by the “Ihasa score” command. This workflow is shown in Fig. 1.

While CACTVS, in an initial transform compilation stage, parses the LHASA transforms written in
CHMTRN/PATRAN, the algorithmic contents of the rules are then converted into internal, binary, data
structures in CACTVS. The rules are therefore made available on the SAVI download page in both versions:
human-readable source code (.src files), and compiled lhasa binary (.clb files).

Building Blocks (BBs). Enamine (Kyiv, Ukraine, enamine.net) provided structural details of 155,129 BBs
that were in stock as of December 2019. These BBs were standardized to remove fragments and salts. Duplicates
were removed via a stereo-sensitive and tautomer-sensitive unique CACT VS hashcode identifier calculated for
each building block. Further filters were applied to remove BBs containing less abundant isotopically labelled
atoms, metals, as well as structures that were too complex to yield reasonable screening compounds, with the
complexity quantitatively defined according to a modified Bertz/Hendrickson algorithm’. This left us with
152,532 structures. They were used to identify two sets of BBs matching one or the other of the two reactants A
and B (see above) for each of the 53 transforms individually, yielding a total of 106 such BB sets. In each of these
individual matching procedures, we removed any BB matching both reagent roles (A and B) to avoid forming
polymers, as well as any BB matching either one reagent role multiple times at different locations, to avoid form-
ing product mixtures. These filtering steps are obviously specific for each transform and reagent role, since they
depend on the required reactive functional groups.

Protecting groups. Handling protecting groups in the most meaningful way can be somewhat tricky. The
issue is that while the planning of a synthetic approach should take protecting groups into account, i.e. present the
chemist with a protected product if available, computations on the molecule as a ligand, such as docking, pharma-
cophore searching, or ADMET property calculations, generally require the unprotected version.

It is possible that a BB set includes the protected version (R1-PG), the unprotected version (R1), or both. The
CHMTRN/PATRAN logic considers the effect of exposed or protected functional groups and either rewards
or penalizes the reaction accordingly. We therefore did not modify the BBs to computationally add or remove
protecting groups. We did however generate modified products by removing protecting groups. Thus, whereas
a standard reaction with reactants R1 and R2 yielding product P that does not involve any protecting group is
executed to the scheme of:

R1+R2 —(CHMTRN/PATRAN) P,
if R1 has a protecting group, which produced a product P-PG, we created a deprotected version P:

R1-PG+ R2 —(CHMTRN/PATRAN) P-PG — (deprotection) P

This deprotected version is saved in the product set, ready for CADD approaches. The original protected
version of the product is added to the SAVI reaction details. In those cases where both a protected and an unpro-
tected version of a building block amenable to a given transform were present in the BB set, a duplicate depro-
tected product P may have been produced, but only if the unprotected version of the BB did not trigger a KILL
statement removing that reaction altogether. Penalization of the reaction with the unprotected BB (if it was not
KILLed) is quite likely. It is therefore probable that such reactions are sorted into the “negative” (i.e. penalized)
subset of SAVI products (see below) via the classification by reaction scores that we apply.

We used the following structures for the handling of protecting groups:

Amino protecting groups: tert-Butoxy carbamate (Boc), fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc), benzyloxy car-
bamate (CBz). Carboxyl protecting groups: tert-Butyl ester (t-Bu ester), benzyl ester (Bz ester). Hydroxyl protect-
ing groups: tert-Butyl ether (t-Bu ether), benzoate (Bz).

Predicted properties. Each SAVI product has been annotated with over 60 properties, including data about
the BBs and proposed reaction (catalog numbers, reactants, general conditions, protection, predicted yield etc.),
identifiers/representations of both the BBs and the product, as well as “drug design” properties such as “Rule of
Five” (RO5)° and “Rule of Three“®”® violations, PAINS (pan assay interference compounds)” filter matches,
FSP3 (fraction of sp? hybridized carbons), and log P. The complete list is available on the SAVI Download web
page” as well as in sections 1 and 2 of Supplementary Information 1. Section 3 of Supplementary Information 1
shows the fields written in SD file format of a SAVI product file. We are also computing and will make available
in the future about 100 different ADME/Tox properties using the program ADMET Predictor (Simulations Plus,
Lancaster, CA).

One of the annotations merits a brief elaboration. In addition to the widely used though increasingly contro-
versial® PAINS filter matches, we have annotated all SAVI products with a score based on 275 rules for iden-
tifying potentially reactive or promiscuous compounds that might interfere with biological assays. We believe
that these rules, described by Bruns and Watson as being based on years of assaying experience at Eli Lilly, have
more relevance and greater discriminatory and predictive power than the PAINS filters. All 275 rules have been
implemented in CACTVS specifically in the context of the SAVI project (with help from Ian Watson), to produce
an overall score called “Bruns and Watson demerit” (the lower the value the better).

Hardware and database. The runs that generated the data presented here were performed in December
2019 — January 2020 on the NIH Biowulf system, a Linux cluster of several tens of thousands of cores (https://hpc.
nih.gov/systems/). Due to the “embarrassingly parallel” nature of the SAVI product generation runs (each reac-
tant pair can be processed independently of all others), the entire job was split into nearly 69,000 subjobs, with
4,000 run simultaneously at any time (which was the per-user limit of jobs on Biowulf). The output of the jobs,
both the structure data and the annotations, was first written to text files (CSV), then loaded into a PostgreSQL
database, which can be queried and analyzed, and whence other formats such as SDF and SMILES lists can be
written. A total of about 2,084,000 CPU hours on Biowulf were used to generate this 2020 version of the SAVI
database.

Data Records

Building blocks used. Out of the total 152,532 accepted Enamine building blocks, application of the pat-
tern-matching part of the 53 productive transforms found 143,365 BBs that fit one or several transforms as a
possible reactant (see Online-only Table 1).

Reactions and unique products generated. A total of 3.59 billion reactant pairs were created
(Online-only Table 1) and then subjected to the reaction logic of the 53 productive transforms. This yielded
1,748,464,003 reactions saved (Table 3)’. Thus, the loss rate caused by encountering KILL statements was about
51%. We re-emphasize that this is a good result: the reduction of the “haystack.” Fig. 2 shows the success rate for
each productive transform. The total number of saved reactions per transform is the product of the reaction pair
count (Table 3, column 3) with the reaction rate. One can see that the reaction success rates span a range from
practically 0% to 100%. It is difficult to decide at this point if these reaction rates are a realistic representation of
what actual synthesis would yield for the BBs amenable to each transform or if this indicates that the transforms
could still be improved.

Table 3 shows the numbers of the saved reactions binned into the different scoring classes (“Plus” or “Negn”
with n equaling at least 0, 10, 20, or 30). We observe that the majority of products (62.6%) are in the Plus class.
At the same time, the highest occupancy among the Neg classes is in the highest (i.e. worst) Neg class. This sug-
gests that it may indeed be advisable, especially for the highly productive transforms, to limit oneself to the Plus
subsets. The “Scoring Class Distribution” sheet in Supplementary Information 2 shows the scoring class distri-
butions for each individual transform. Two of the transforms, Kabbe Synthesis of 4-Chromanones (ID 2296) and
Benzazepin-2-ones by Pictet-Spengler Reaction (ID 2630) generated 10,000 or more products, but none in the
Plus class.

As already mentioned, it is entirely possible, and in no way undesirable, that the same molecule is produced
by two different reactions, be it from the same building blocks but different procedures, or from different BBs and
either the same or different transforms. Counting the unique products out of the 1,748,464,003 saved reactions
yielded 1,526,316,392 molecules.

Success rates and implicit SAR series. _ If we take the total number of accepted BBs, 152,532, observe that
every one of the 53 used reactions essentially follows the pattern A+ B — C, we can calculate the theoretically
possible maximum number of products as a % * 153,532? * 53 ~ 617 billion. (We ignore, for simplicity’s sake, the
possibility that in some cases, when multiple reactive groups are present in a BB, one could have A+ B — C and
B+ A — C. We remove such cases anyway during the reactant pair generation.) Our actually generated product
set being 1.75 billion, our success rate in this sense is about 1/350. This reduction is caused by both (a) the fact
that most pairs R1 and R2 do not match the PATRAN patterns of any of our transforms, and (b) the 51% loss rate
encountered by KILL statements in the CHMTRN reaction logic.

The totality of potential products defined from Ngz building blocks and n, transforms as Ng,” * n, can be seen
as a large, triangular, three-dimensional matrix. Even though this matrix is very sparse, it contains for each filled
cell (i.e. saved product) a large set of neighbors with R1 being constant and R2 varying, and vice versa. These sets
can be seen as SAR series of sorts, which is a built-in feature of the approach. Due to the variety of chemistries
presented in our transforms, the diversity within these series however is likely higher than in typical large-scale
combinatorial libraries. Detailed diversity analysis of SAVI will therefore be needed to determine how close these
compound series are to SAR series typically used in medicinal chemistry. For each accepted SAVI product, we can
estimate the average size of the SAR series as follows. Remembering that the duplication across product space is
about 15%, i.e. 85% of the products occur only once across all transforms, we can without too much error project
all products onto the flattened two-dimensional matrix sized 143,365 x 143,365, which has 20.6 billion cells. If
all cells were filled in a triangular occupation, each generated molecule would have % * 143,365 SAR neighbors
within each row, and the same number within each column, i.e. a total of about 143,000 SAR neighbors. A SAR
neighbor is defined here as a molecule having the same BB R1 but any other R2, and equivalently for R2. However,
we have only about 17% of the (triangular) matrix elements filled with truly generated products. This yields an
average of about 24,800 SAR neighbors for each SAVI product.

Protected and unprotected SAVI products. Nearly 10% of the products (153,001,115 products) were
generated from at least one protected building block. Protecting groups were removed before writing these prod-
ucts to the SAVI database. A suffix was added to the SAVI ID of a product: UN (UNprotected) if the product was
generated from unprotected BBs; DP (DeProtected) if the product was generated from protected BBs but depro-
tected before writing it to the SAVI database.

Technical Validation

Overlap with other databases. We calculated the overlap of SAVI with three large databases (Table 4): the
REAL (REadily AccesibLe) database from Enamine®’, the iResearch Library (iRL) from ChemNavigator/Sigma
Aldrich’, and PubChem*. For PubChem, we measured an overlap rate of 0.3%, i.e. >99% of the SAVI products
are not in PubChem. Still, this small percentage corresponds to more than 5 million molecules that are in both
databases. Among those are structures that have biological assay data (186,291 compounds). Overlap analysis

with DrugBank V.5.1.5° showed that 547 SAVI compounds are in fact drugs. These compounds show that SAVI
does generate “real” molecules.

Based on the fact that both the SAVI database and the REAL database use Enamine BBs, it is of interest to
know the overlap between those very large databases. We see that on the order of 10% of either database is also
present in the other. This is reassuring both in the sense that reasonable chemistry is being created by SAVI and
that each of these Enamine-BB-based databases provides its own richness of unique structures.

We also notice that we in fact “re-synthesize” 34,241 of the building blocks themselves. The most likely expla-
nation is that the Enamine BBs contains series of BBs that were synthetically based on each other. This again
shows that calling a molecule a building block is mostly a matter of definition and practical considerations, not
an invariant chemical property.

Ring system analysis. As mentioned above, one goal in the creation of the SAVI versions so far has been
to build novel molecules, not just modify existing molecules with new or interchanged functional groups. We
aimed for this by emphasizing coupling and ring-building transforms. Sixteen of the 53 transforms are exclusively
ring-forming (see Tables 1 and 2, third column), which yielded 8,227,198 products with newly formed rings. We
note that intra-molecular application of coupling transforms can also lead to the formation of rings. However,
this may also lead to polymer formation and was therefore generally excluded in this version of SAVI. Extra infor-
mation may be added in the future into the transforms themselves to better handle intra-molecular cyclization.

Novel ring systems, i.e. ring systems never before seen in any known compound, have most likely also been
generated by SAVI. Conducting a stringent analysis would require a reference body of molecules. Arguably,
this would be the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) REGISTRY, which is however not readily available in bulk.
Manual checking in SciFinder of several hundred cases and extrapolation to the entire database indicate that
more than 1,000 novel ring systems may have been created by SAVI.

A count of ring systems, both aromatic and aliphatic, yielded 39,036 unique ring systems in SAVI products.
Rings that were already present in the building blocks were also counted. We compared the SAVI ring system
count with the ring systems found in three large databases (‘Table 5).

We note that the REAL database, while of similar size to SAVI, and based on essentially the same building
block set, contain less than a tenth of the number of ring systems found in SAVI. This is likely due to the fact that
the chemistries involved in creating SAVI contained more ring-forming transforms than those used for REAL.
PubChem, a very diverse database aggregated from hundreds of sources”’ with very different types of compounds,
shows a much larger number of different ring systems. Yet, the iRL, also combining hundreds of sources (but only
of screening samples), only slightly surpasses SAVI. Perhaps most interestingly, the ring overlap subsets of SAVI
(Table 5) comprised only a few thousand cases for each of the three databases (PubChem: 3,295; REAL: 2,145;
iRL: 2,883) while the ring systems present only in SAVI added up to 35,623.

Distribution of properties relevant for drug design. Figure 3 depicts a selection of property distri-
butions of SAVI that are generally seen as important for drug design. The plots shown here are for the Plus
subset of SAVI; values for the Negn” sets (plots are provided in sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Supplementary
Information 1) show similar distributions. These together with the additional properties provided in section 4 of
the Supplementary Information 1 show that the SAVI product set is well suited for drug development. We note
that the distribution of QED (quantitative estimate of drug-likeness) values is more drug-like than any of the
databases analyzed in the original QED publication”’. Similarly, the Bruns & Watson demerits® are within the
strict limit of <100 used at Eli Lilly in 41% of the Plus SAVI compounds, and within the looser Eli Lilly limit of
<160 in 65% of the cases.

Similarities and differences to other compound generation and synthesis prediction sys-

GDB-17 of 166 billion enumerated organic small molecules of up to 17 heavy atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens”.
However, such automatically enumerated databases — as well as in principle any purely de novo designed molecule
— suffer from the significant drawback that no practical synthetic route is a priori attached to these structures, and
that therefore, in general, (a) manual - and thus expensive — investigation of possible synthetic routes is necessary,

 

SCIENTIFICDATA| (2020) 7:384 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00727-4 9

(b) resulting routes may be complicated, multi-step syntheses, and (c) synthesis of the molecule may in the end
prove altogether unsuccessful (or untenably expensive) even after significant effort.

Pharmaceutical companies have recognized since about 2010 the need for, and benefits of, generating
large virtual libraries of easily synthesizable compounds such as Pfizer’s Global Virtual Library’’, Boehringer
Ingleheim’s BI CLAIM”, and Eli Lilly’s Proximal Lilly Collection (PLC)”, the last probably being closest concep-
tually to SAVI. Still, there are several, and important, differences between these and SAVI, not least the fact that
the resulting virtual libraries are proprietary and thus not available to the public.

The Hartenfeller publication® and its subsequent companion paper analyzing to what degree products gener-
ated with these chemistries would cover the bioactivity-relevant chemical space’®, sparked a number of projects
that based large virtual libraries on these SMIRKS-encoded “Hartenfeller reactions”’’-’”’. Numerous other pro-
jects involving virtual and tangible chemistry spaces and reaction prediction tools have emerged in the recent
past®”*! and have been reviewed in the literature*’, as have projects of using such ultra-large libraries for virtual
screening®***

The majority of rule-based approaches use SMIRKS to encode the transforms needed to cover the desired
chemical space®**°. The SMIRKS used by these tools can number in the thousands, especially if retrosynthetic
prediction is the goal (“predict the synthesis of a given molecule in any possible way”). SMIRKS, however, do not
allow one to directly encode the synthetic chemists’ accumulated knowledge about constraints and limitations
of the reactions as a function of the structural details of the reactants. For example, does the SMIRKS for the
Sonogashira coupling”,

[#6;$(C=C—[#6]), $(c:c):1] [Br, I]. [CH1;$(C#CC) :2] >> [#6:1] [C:2]

really describe decades of experience of thousands of chemists about when this reaction works, how well, with
what yields, and when it might not work at all? On the last point, there is no way to incorporate into a (single)
SMIRKS a condition for rejecting the reaction altogether.

SAVI, in contrast, is an expert system approach with a detailed reaction logic that can be incorporated in the
CHMTRN/PATRAN files. One such rule can therefore correspond to a large number of SMIRKS (some of which
might be quite complicated); and CHMTRN/PATRAN can include features that cannot be expressed in SMIRKS
at all (such as computed electron density).

A number of recent approaches are based on statistical evaluation of existing large bodies of reaction
data*’-’° by unleashing modern machine learning methods on these data sets. Molecular structure representa-
tion is often done by SMILES. While impressive results have been achieved by these approaches whose central
machine-learning algorithms may or may not be aware of chemistry at all, we see several advantages of SAVI
compared to these approaches. Learning from existing data sets will always learn what is known, and preferen-
tially learn what is widely used, i.e. strongly represented in the learning set. CHMTRN/PATRAN transforms can,
in contrast, be used to add brand-new or unpublished chemistry into SAVI without having to wait for reaction
databases to fill up with examples of such reactions. This has not been used much for SAVI up until now because
we first wanted to populate the SAVI transform set with reliable, well-known chemistry that would be readily
accepted by chemists. However, we have added new transforms in the recent past (not used for creation of the
data presented here) as new synthetic approaches are being published. The latest examples include sulfonimid-
amide synthesis”’ and modular click chemistry. With accelerating advances in synthetic organic chemistry we
expect rapid growth of SAVI”.

The usage of sophisticated transforms that incorporate a scoring system makes it possible to use negative
outcomes of the reaction logic (KILLed reactions, reactions with SUBTRACT demerits) to create large sets of
(computationally) failed reactions, which may be useful for, e.g., machine learning approaches. Such efforts are
currently being investigated.

Multi-step reactions. Multi-step reactions are trivial to conceive in SAVI but daunting in their pro-
spective sizes. For example, taking just the output of the click chemistry transform (transform ID 2875,
Copper[I]-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition), which produced 1 million molecules, as input for a second step
(ie. combining them with the standard BB compounds), yielded more than 50 billion reactant pairs. Taking the
entire 1 billion current SAVI output set instead as new BBs can be estimated to yield 1 trillion actually accepted
reactions. Techniques such as targeted growing into this huge space of 3-reactant, 2-step, SAVI syntheses will be
needed, which will be the topic of future reports.

Applications. The SAVI database is being used in a number of drug discovery projects at the National Cancer
Institute and with collaborators world-wide, including against SARS-CoV-2 targets. Reports on these projects
will be published separately.

Usage Notes

In the context of the SAVI project, we employ a chemoinformatics usage of terms, which may differ from syn-
thetic chemists’ conventions. The (typically: named) chemistries used in SAVI are described by “transforms” (also
called “rules”), whereas the application of a transform to a specific set of starting materials yields a “reaction.” For
example, there is one Sonogashira coupling transform/rule, but its application to all possible starting materials
may yield tens of millions of Sonogashira reactions, each with a specific reaction product. The starting materi-
als are taken from a set of possible reactants, which are also called building blocks (BB(s)). Some of the newly
added named reactions were encoded in several different transforms expressing variants of reaction mechanisms,
which we call “chemistries.” For example, the Suzuki-Miyaura chemistry is encoded in six different transforms:
Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling (Bromo), Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling (Iodo), etc. (see Table 2).
