Abstract

Local authorities i.e. government officials working at the district level and below and elected representatives of
municipalities are the steering body of local-level disaster response mechanism in Nepal. The effectiveness of
response operation moreover depends on their competency. This paper investigates their disaster response
knowledge, preparedness, and perception, and to identify gaps and suggest recommendations.

The prevailing competency of Nepalese local authorities doesn’t warrant an effective response during the time of
disaster. They lack awareness and preparedness. Amidst their positive perception towards the need of disaster
response capacity building, in the void of an effective mechanism, the government has failed to enhance their

competency.

The national investment for disaster resoonse competency building is meager in Nepal. The country heavily relies
on foreign aid. The present capacity-building mechanism should be redressed from the newer dynamic.

Introduction

Today, effective disaster response has become a biggest
challenge to the governments of the world. Research has
proven that a centralized governance system is not suit-
able for effective disaster response (Daly et al. 2017). The
2005-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) and
2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
have also reaffirmed the need of decentralized approach
for effective disaster response (UNISDR 2005; UNISDR
2015). Centralized government's rigid bureaucratic frame-
work, organizational hierarchy, and politicized budget and
accountability mechanism is unsupportive for the venture
especially at mega-disaster (Miller and Douglass 2016).

Since disaster response is a bottom up approach, local
level disaster response mechanism is the fundamental
pillar for decentralization. As local authority and the
local community should respond immediately to a disas-
ter their effectiveness is crucial. In that sense, their com-
petency plays critical role to save lives and properties at
the time of disaster.

Today, Nepal is amongst the most disaster prone
countries in the world. It ranks 4th and 11th in terms of
climate change vulnerability and earthquake vulnerabil-
ity respectively and 20th in terms of multi hazard vul-
nerable country in the world (UNDRR 2019; MoHA
2018a, 2018b). Basically the country’s complex geo-
graphic location, diverse topography and highly varying
climatic condition are the reasons for the geological and
hydro-meteorological disasters. The situation has been
further deteriorated by the unplanned development

work, uncontrolled population growth, and increasing
poverty. Precisely earthquake, landslide, flood, inunda-
tion, glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), cold wave, heat
wave, windstorms and hailstorms have been the reasons
for killing more than 500 people every year in the coun-
try (MoHA 2015, 2018a, 2018b). Unfortunately, at
present, more than 80% of the total population of the
country is living under the risk of disaster (MoHA
2018a, 2018b).

The country’s local level disaster response is relied at
large on the capacity of the local level authority that
comprises of the government officials and elected repre-
sentatives functioning at district and municipality level.
Since they are the members of the District Disaster
Management Committee (DDMC) and Local Disaster
Response Committee (LDMC), the local level response
mechanisms, The Disaster Risk Reduction and Manage-
ment Act 2017 has mandated them to remain crucial at
the time of disaster (The Disaster Risk Reduction and
Management Act 2017). From formulating response plan
to carry out effective preparedness activities, arrange and
deliver relief materials and carry out effective response
such authorities have crucial role to play.

As per the act the Chief District Office (CDO) should
lead DDMC whereas the elected mayor of the respective
municipality should lead LDMC (The Disaster Risk Re-
duction and Management Act 2017 2017). And the pub-
lic servants working in administration, health, education,
drinking water, road networks, communication offices at
district and municipality levels, and the elected represen-
tatives such as deputy mayor, ward chief, ward members
should be the active members of these committees (The
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act 2017
2017). And by virtue of their mandates they should be
competent enough to render effective response at the
time of disaster.

Precisely saving lives, reducing economic loses and al-
leviating suffering of the victims are the objectives of the
response phase in which activation of emergency oper-
ation centers, evacuation of threatened population, car-
rying out search and rescue operations, management of
information, carrying out emergency medical care, open-
ing shelters for displaced population, mass care of the
victims and restoring emergency public services are the
functions needed to be carried out and lead role should
be played by aforementioned local authorities. And to
ensure these functions’ systematic undertaking of the
tasks, utmost cooperation among stakeholders and avoid
duplication of effort the ‘cluster approach’ mechanism
should be resorted (IASC 2006). As per NDRF, at na-
tional level there should be eleven clusters whereas at
local level (district and below), as per the requirement,
there may be nine or more clusters (see Table 1). And
the officials of the respective ministries, functioning at

Page 2 of 13

district level and below, and also the members of DDMC
and LDMC, should take lead of the clusters, whereas the
international humanitarian organizations (UN, ICRC,
and INGO) should remain the assisting agencies and,
public and private humanitarian organizations should re-
main the partners.

Now question arises how effective are these commit-
tees and the clusters. Many researches have indicated
that the local level disaster response is always problem-
atic in Nepal (Anderson 1995; Smith 2001; Niekerk
2007; Shrestha and Pathranarakul 2018). Robert Piper, a
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nepal,
once stated that “after five years of working on disaster
management in Nepal, I have come to recognize that the
addressing Nepal’s disaster response is first the govern-
ance problem” (Piper 2013) and one reason for such
consequence is the lack of knowledge and preparedness
amongst the government authorities and elected repre-
sentatives. Khazai et al. (2018) also stated that the
Nepal’s local level response mechanism doesn’t suffice
the need of effective response thus requires more cap-
acity building program.

Various post-disaster reports of mega disasters, such
as earthquake of 2015, have also indicated that at times
the search and rescue, damage assessment, information
management, relief management, and rehabilitation had
been problematic (Sanderson and Ramalingam 2015).
Jones et al. (2014) claimed that the Nepalese government
officials and the elected representatives, especially at the
local level, are the protective of their own interest and
slow to enact policies to support disaster response initia-
tives. Gaire et al. (2015) also stated that although Nepal
has been participated in many international and national
risk management initiatives the ground level policy im-
plementation has always remained problematic. As per
Wendelbo et al. (2016) the existing disaster management
rules, regulations and framework are neither fully funded
nor fully enacted in Nepal.

One of the reasons for such consequence is the pre-
conceived belief of the local authorities that the disaster
response is the sole responsibility of the security forces
and CDO (Shrestha and Pathranarakul 2018). In practice
too during disaster these two entities tend to be heavily
engaged carrying out multiple responsibilities whereas
other entities remain hardly incorporated. Because of
such tendency, empirically, local authorities tend to re-
main indifference and hesitant to engage in disaster pre-
paredness activities, especially in their own capacity
building process. Shrestha and Pathranarakul (2018)
stressed that the ignorant of own roles and responsibil-
ities and indecisiveness of local authorities are amongst
the reasons for ineffective disaster responses in Nepal.

When it comes to the disaster response competency
various researches have argued that the fundamental

knowledge, disaster response preparedness and the re-
sponder’s perception are the three primary pillars
(Barsky et al. 2007). Mendis et al. (2007) had argued that
the knowledge is the fundamental resource to enhance a
function intelligently and if applied properly can provide
a driving force for the action (Sallis and Jone 2002).
Therefore special attention should be given to raise the
knowledge and expertise of such local bodies so that
they can prepare public services to function at the time
of crisis (National Research Council 1991). In that sense
knowledge on the protocols of disaster management
cycle, structural framework, legal provision, role and re-
sponsibility of various agencies, aspect of coordination,
command control and communication, etc. is imperative
for the government official and elected representative
functioning at the local level.

Perception is a form of cognition on which conceptual
knowledge and primary form of awareness rely upon
(Efron 1969). Penrose (2000) has stated that perception
has the potential to influence the extent to which some-
one is willing to engage in disaster management. Some-
how perception is also a force multiplier to influence the
action of an individual. Since perception is a view and
interpretation based on belief, experience and under-
standing help to gauge the level of competency of an in-
dividual in disaster response (Wolf and Moser 2011).

Similarly, preparedness activity is the most vital element
for competency building process (Drabek and Hoetmer
1991). It helps to develop operational capabilities and
helps to facilitate effective response at the time of disaster
(Drabek and Hoetmer 1991). Mileti (1991) has stated that
the effective preparedness and response help to save a life,
reduce injury, limit property damage and minimize all sort
of disruption at the time of disaster. Preparedness also
helps to establish responsibility, identify function and re-
source, and increases inter-organizational coordination
and communication which are the typical problems at the
time of crisis at the local level (Heide 1989).

Periodic training, exercise, and rehearsal are the pre-
requisites for robust preparedness (McEntire and Myers
2004). Such activity gives the responder a platform to
design effective, realistic and coordinated planning that ul-
timately helps to reduce duplication of effort when mul-
tiple stakeholders exert holistic effort at the time of
disaster (ICRC 2000; Ingrassia et al. 2014). Precisely train-
ing helps to impart disaster-related knowledge to a re-
sponder whereas exercise and rehearsal help him to test
his applicability of that knowledge and planning capability
(Perry and Peterson 1999; Drabek and Hoetmer 1991).

Unfortunately in Nepal, the academic study of ‘disaster
response’ discipline has remained in shadow till date
(Ghimire 2018). It is because the research sphere has
Malla et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:15

been heavily dominated by ‘pre disaster risk reduction
and mitigation’. Implicitly this tendency has allowed the
existing deficiencies of the disaster response venture to
remain stay put or even exacerbate. In such a scenario,
this research is instrumental. This paper has investigated
the prevailing disaster response competency of local au-
thorities keeping their fundamental disaster management
knowledge, response preparedness and disaster response
perception at nexus and dug out the prevailing gaps.
And for the reason followings questions have been set as
the research questions.

1. Do the disaster management fundamental know-
ledge, disaster response preparedness and disaster re-
sponse perception of the local level government officials
and elected representatives warrant an effective response
at the time of disaster?

2. What are the prevailing gaps in present disaster re-
sponse competency building process of local authorities?
And what are the means to plug them?

Methodology

Research overview

The study was derived from field research adopting a
quantitative method. Collection of primary data and their
analysis was carried out to investigate the disaster man-
agement knowledge, perception and preparedness of the
study participants. Government officials-administrators
and public servants- working at district and municipality,
and elected representative of municipality were the fo-
cused study group, since they are the members of DDMC
and LDMC and have leading role to play at the time of
disaster response.

A set of questionnaire that is cognitive to answer was
designed for the survey. While designing the question
consideration was given to ask fundamental and generic
issues imperative for all DDMC and LDMC members.
Consideration was also given to avoid complication in
the understanding of the questions since the DDMC and
LDMC members tend to be from various governmental
departments with different responsibilities. Besides vari-
ous disaster management literature, binding and non-
binding national and international documents, policy pa-
pers, directives, and SOPs were studied in due process of
research.

Sample population

Adopting purposive-sampling altogether 149 officials
from thirteen districts, who should be the part of local
level disaster response mechanism, were selected for
data collection (see Fig. 1) (Barbour 2008). Consideration
was given to include study participants from terai and
mountain regions, since both are most prone to disas-
ters. Unable to include study participants from Far East

Page 4 of 13

and Far West regions is one of the limitations of this
study.

The selected study participants suppose to be the
members of DDMC and LDMC were from two categor-
ies- the government official and the local elected repre-
sentative. Eighty participants were the government
officials i.e. public servants and bureaucrats working at
the district level and municipality and 69 participants
were the elected representatives ie. mayors, deputy
mayors, ward chief and ward members of the municipal-
ity, rural municipality. The choice of participants was
driven by the research questions, not by a concern of
representativeness.

Research design

For survey all together 24 closed-ended Self Administered
Questions (SAQ) waere designed (Ronan et al. 2010; Kur-
oiwa 1993 and Arya 1993). These questions were divided
into three categories. The first category comprised of
seventeen questions to investigate study participants’ disas-
ter response awareness. The knowledge about the different
types of disasters occurring in the country and the funda-
mental knowledge of disaster response mechanism, system
and chain of command were the questions here. The sec-
ond category comprised four questions to investigate their
perception in disaster response capacity building. Whether
disaster response capacity of local authority including se-
curity forces should be enhanced, is capacity building en-
deavor equally important for them and does the country
needs a separate entity for disaster management are the
part of the questions in this category. Similarly, the third
category comprised of three questions to investigate their
preparedness level that is their involvement in any disaster
management training, exercise and whether their respect-
ive offices have disaster response Standing Operating Pro-
cedure (SOP) or not.

In overall three types of closed-ended SAQs was de-
signed. First was Likert Scale questions, the second was
‘check all that applies’ type and third was Dichotomous
questions. During analysis, all the replies were re-coded
into the ordinal scale.

To facilitate the understanding of the participants, the
questions were designed in Nepali script and were trans-
lated into the English language during analysis. Enumera-
tors that are well knowledgeable in disaster management
discipline were utilized to facilitate the overall survey
process.

The survey was conducted in an interview style. Aver-
agely 20-30 minutes took for each participant to
complete the question-answer process.

Method of analysis
Basically, the inferential analysis method was adopted to
investigate the disaster response competency of a local

government official and elected representative. Three
key independent variables-knowledge, perception, and
preparedness-and two dependent variables- government
official and elected representative - were taken into con-
sideration during analysis.

The Cross Tabulation and Kruskal-Wallis Test were
adopted to study the interactions between dependent
and independent variables. Their results were illustrated
through the bar graph and comparison table. For detail
analysis, the results of the graphic rating scale and nu-
meric rating scale were rephrased into nominal scale.
For example, in an issue, if a respondent participant
replies ‘Strongly agree’ and ‘Agree’ then he/she is consid-
ered as well informed. The relationship between inde-
pendent and dependent variables was examined through
Cross Tabulation and their statistically significant was
verified through the Kruskal-Wallis Test. The SPSS 16.0
software was used for the analysis process.

Result and analysis

Fundamental knowledge of disaster management

At first, eight questions were asked to the study partici-
pants’ knowledge on disaster vulnerability in Nepal.
48.9% of the participants considered flood and inunda-
tion as the most vulnerable disasters in the country.

Subsequently, 39.7% participants considered earthquake,
35.5% participants considered fire, 17.5% participants
considered landslide, and 16% of the participants consid-
ered draught as vulnerable. Similarly, tsunami, avalanche,
and volcano were considered by 5%, 3% and 1.9% of the
participants subsequently (see Fig. 2). But as per the data
derived from MoHA fire is the most vulnerable disaster in
Nepal. In last 54 years 5837 fire incidents had occurred.
However as per human loss the earthquake is the most
devastating (see Fig. 2). Then there comes the flood and
inundation, and landslide as per the frequency of occur-
rence. But landslide has killed more people than flood and
inundation. Similarly, draught and avalanche had occurred
only 126 and 125 times. And there is no history of volcano
occurrence in Nepal. (see Fig. 3).

Another nine questions were asked to examine the dis-
aster management knowledge of the study participants.
The analysis reveals that around 50% of the participants
were not aware of five issues amongst nine. Unfortu-
nately, only 44.3% of the participants replied that MoHA
is the leading agency for disaster management in Nepal.

Indeed this is a dismaying fact that 55% of the partici-
pating local officials were not found aware of this basic
fact. Similarly, 55% of the participants replied that
NEOC falls under MoHA. Here also 45% of the

participants lacked the knowledge. And only 51% of par-
ticipants are convinced that the LDMC should conduct
disaster mock drill at the local level. Another 49% of the
participants didn’t have knowledge that the Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Act 2017 has mandated
local government to strengthen the local-level response
capability.

Around 28% of the participants didn’t know that there
are three tiers of disaster management committees in
the country. Similarly, another 90% of the participants
didn’t know that the DDMC doesn’t have authority to
declare disaster emergency at the local level. It is the re-
sponsibility of the central government and DDMC can
only recommend declaring disaster emergency to its
higher chain of command.

Flood

Only 22% of the participants knew that the elected
municipal chairperson should lead LDMC. 35% of the
participants identified another basic fact that the local
government is the most responsible body to manage dis-
aster in the country. Dismayingly, 65% of the partici-
pants were found unknown to this reality (see Fig. 4). In
overall, the study participants’ awareness in disaster vul-
nerability and disaster management fundamental know-
ledge is not convincing. Huge gap prevails in this
context.

Perception on disaster response

Four questions were asked to study the perception of
the study participants on disaster response. Encour-
agingly all the responses were convincing. 90% of the

participants agreed that the local level disaster response
capacity needs enhancement. Around 80% participant
also agreed that the search and rescue capacity of the se-
curity forces needs improvement since they are the
prime tool. And around 60% of the participants agreed
that the local elected representative and government of-
ficial should take part in a disaster response exercise (see
Fig. 5). Similarly, 58% of the participants agreed that

ricula to enhance disaster response preparedness, when

career. Another 46% of the participants replied that they
have participated in some sort of disaster response exer-
cise (see Fig. 6). Whereas more than 50% of the partici-
pants were found neither trained nor exercised in disaster
response.

In the part of emergency plan 64% of the participants
replied that their offices have prepared Standing Operat-
ing Procedure (SOP) or directive for emergency re-
sponse purpose. Whereas in the public service offices
where 36% of the participants functioning do not exist
any emergency response plan. This result shows that the
disaster response preparedness of study participants is
not satisfying.

Comparative study of the knowledge, preparedness and
perception of the government official and elected
representative

During comparative study differences were found in the
result of knowledge, perception and preparedness of the
government officials and elected representatives. Although
the elected representatives have better understanding in
disaster consequences and their vulnerability (see Fig. 7)
their fundamental knowledge is lesser in most of the cases
compared to the government officials. Government offi-
cials were found slightly knowledgeable in fundamental is-
sues (see Fig. 7). In part of perception too the government
officials have better opinion than the elected representa-
tives (see Fig. 7). But in the part of preparedness the
elected representatives were found more trained than gov-
ernment officials and their offices have better SOP prepar-
ation compared to the government officials (Fig. 7).

But, at the end, this result has raised a question in the
quality of preparedness activities. Although the elected
representatives are more engaged in training their funda-
mental knowledge is not better than government official
neither they have better perception.

Statistical analysis: consequence of the nature of service
(government official vs political representative) in
competency

Since, a government official is a bureaucrat hired by the
government to work for the public sector where as polit-
ical representative is elected by the people to represent
them in a legislature or government their nature of ser-
vice is different. To test whether such difference in na-
ture of service makes any statistical relationship in their
disaster response competency or not Kruskal- Wallis test
has been carried out. And the result shows that the dif-
ference in nature in service doesn’t make any statisti-
cally significant difference in their knowledge and
preparedness. It is because in most of the cases of
these two variables the p values are over 0.05 (p>
0.05) (see Table 2). Only in perception statistical sig-
nificant has been observed. In three cases out of four
the p values are less than 0.05 (y < 0.05) (see Table 2).
Since the nature of service has only statistical rela-
tionship in perception doesn’t have statistical relation-
ship in overall competency.

Correlation analysis among knowledge, perception and
preparedness

The result of Pearson Correlation shows that the know-
ledge is significantly correlated with perception and pre-
paredness since the p values are less than 0.05 (p < 0.05).
Whereas perception and preparedness do not have any
significant correlation as their p values are over 0.05
(P>0.05) (see Table 3). This shows that knowledge is
the foundation of perception and preparedness factors
since the increment in knowledge also leads to the en-
hance the perception and preparedness.

Discussion

The findings reveal that the disaster response compe-
tency of the local authorities in Nepal is not enough to
render effective response. The prevailing disaster re-
sponse knowledge and preparedness of the government
official and elected representative is deficit. Such ten-
dency ultimately weakens the overall local level disaster
response mechanism of the country.

As per Bendimerad (n.d.) the weakness in the disaster
response knowledge in local authority ultimately weakens
the overall disaster management mechanism since they
lack proactivity to work for the venture. Similarly, Chris-
tensen (1985) also argued that incompetency, because of
lack of knowledge and preparedness, is a thorny problem
in disaster response planning and policymaking. Unfortu-
nately, today only 83 out of 753 local governments have
formed their disaster management committee whereas
formulation of disaster management committee is indeed
mandatory as per The Disaster Risk Reduction and Man-
agement Act 2017 2017 (MoHA 2019). Similarly, only 45

municipalities have their disaster management policy and
plan at hand (MoHA 2019). And such lethargy is the re-
sult of not other than the incompetence of local author-
ities which is implicitly further exacerbating the
communities’ disaster vulnerability.

In the part of perception the findings were much en-
couraging. Despite such weaknesses in knowledge and
preparedness, the local authorities have the positive feel-
ing that they should take part in disaster response opera-
tions and capacity building process. Such positivity will

definitely catalyze the competency if the response cap-
acity is enhanced properly. But unfortunately the gov-
ernment is lacking from grasping this opportunity.
Today the lethargic disaster response capacity building
process is the direst fissure to result feeble local level disas-
ter response system in the country. The concern
ministries-Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and Ministry
of Federal Affairs and General Administration (MoFAGA)-
have been lacking from fulfilling their mandate of enhan-
cing disaster response capacity of local authorities (Local

Government Operation Act 2017 2017; The Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Act 2017 2017). Various liter-
atures have pointed that in Nepal lack of dedicated institu-
tion, void of effective training program, void of effective
curriculum along with lack of national policy, plan and
dedicated resource allocation are the problems stacked in
the disaster response capacity building venture.

Although the national institutions - Nepal Administra-
tive Staff College (NASC) and Local Development Train-
ing Academy (LDTA) along with LDTA’s nine training
centers in the country- have responsibility to enhance
disaster response capacity of the government officials
and elected representatives have not been effective since
disaster response trainings and curriculum are not get-
ting required priority. The “32nd Basic Administration
Training Program 2016/17’ can be taken as an example
to corroborate this claim. The training program was
conducted by the Nepal Administrative Staff College for
the fresh recruited government officers that had only
two sessions of 40 minutes each for the overall disaster
management teaching including disaster response,
whereas the program was run for eighty days with
altogether 180 sessions. Similarly, another training pro-
gram at the staff college the Advance Course on Man-
agement and Development run for second class
government officials (mid-level officer) didn’t have a sin-
gle session for ‘disaster management’. Besides staff col-
lege have not been running any specific disaster
management training for any government officials. Once
an officer at Staff College claimed that the disaster man-
agement is a well known subject to government officials
hence not needed a separate training program. He
Malla et al. Geoenvironmental Disasters (2020) 7:15

further added that the ad-hoc disaster management cur-
riculum running in various government training pro-
grams will suffice the need. Likewise, there is also a void
of disaster response capacity building program for the
elected representative. For example the three days train-
ing package developed by LDTA for elected representa-
tives is more over focused on ‘disaster risk management
and climate change’. Disaster response training curricu-
lum has not been incorporated in the package. In such a
scenario expecting effective response capacity from local
authorities is not more than a distant dream.

Another shortfall that has mired the venture is the
government’s over-reliance tendency on the external
support for capacity building of local authorities (Qu
et al. 2012). Experts have claimed that the state’s over-
reliance on NGO/INGO for capacity building initiative
is a problem in the long run (Jones et al. 2014). It is be-
cause such over-relying tendency incurs challenge to the
government since it weakens local ownership and limits
commitment, deepens dependency on foreign resource
and experts, and weakens rather than builds local insti-
tutions and their capacity (Godfrey et al. 2002). In that
sense NGO/INGO involvement may be a short term so-
lution in capacity building process but not the perman-
ent means.

Nepal can learn from Japan and Bangladesh in the
context of governments’ disaster response capacity
building process. In Japan, the Disaster Management
Bureau, that comes under the Cabinet Office, headed by
the Honorable Prime Minister, runs Disaster Reduction
Specialist Training for local authorities on regular basis
(Cabinet Office 2015). Similarly, every year, the Central
Department Management Council determines the
Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Frame-
work which is exercised nationwide by local author-
ities on Disaster Preparedness Day (lst September)
(Cabinet Office 2015). Likewise, in Bangladesh the
Disaster Management Bureau, under the Ministry of
Disaster Management and Relief, function as catalyst
agency for organizing systematic training programs
for local authorities from national down to local level
(Haque and Uddin 2013).

Similarly, many other countries have established dedi-
cated training institutions that are completely dedicated
to delivery disaster-related training to the local author-
ities. The following are some examples of the training
institute and their disaster preparedness training pro-
grams. (see Tables 4 and 5).

Indeed at present devising a national policy on dis-
aster response capacity building, establishment of a
dedicated training institution and designing standard
training curriculum are the urgent needs of the coun-
try (MoHA 2009). Besides, to mainstream public ser-
vices into the sphere of effective disaster response,

policy should be made that each and_ every

aster management training package in their curricu-
lum. This will definitely help to plug the existing gap
of disaster response competency of local authorities.

Undeniably, disaster response is a bottom-up approach
and local authorities are the nexus of the overall venture.
Therefore rather than relying on foreign aid, the state
shouldn’t hesitate to invest own national resources on
regular basis to enhance their capacity. Indeed, a dollar
invested today in disaster preparedness will save six dol-
lars tomorrow during response. And for a poor country
like Nepal resource management during post disaster re-
construction is another disaster.

Conclusion

Today the disaster response knowledge and prepared-
ness of Nepalese government officials and local author-
ities is dearth. Such dearth doesn’t ensure effective
response at the time of crisis. The lack of government’s
effort to enhance their capability is the ultimate cause of
the problem.

Similarly over reliance on foreign support for capacity
building process is another hurdle that has garnered
lethargy amongst national authorities along with crip-
pled the national capacity building mechanism. Such
support can only be a short term solution. For ultimate
solution, there requires a national policy, national cap-
acity building institution, regular flow of national re-
sources, and standard training program and curriculum.
Besides, making disaster response training and curricu-
lum mandatory in each and every government run train-
ing program for local authorities is also helpful to
unfasten the tightened knot of capacity building.

There is no denial at any level that Nepal needs an ef-
fective local level disaster response mechanism and that
is only achievable if the disaster response competency of
local authorities is enhanced properly. However to
achieve that object the overall disaster response capacity
building process of the country needs revitalization and
resuscitation from a newer dynamic.
