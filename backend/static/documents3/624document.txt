Abstract

Introduction: Due to the menacing increase in the number of vehicles on a daily basis, abating road congestion is
becoming a key challenge these years. To cope-up with the prevailing traffic scenarios and to meet the ever-
increasing demand for traffic, the urban transportation system needs effective solution methodologies. Changes
made in the urban infrastructure will take years, sometimes may not even be feasible. For this reason, traffic signal
timing (TST) optimization is one of the fastest and most economical ways to curtail congestion at the intersections

and improve traffic flow in the urban network.

Purpose: Researchers have been working on using a variety of approaches along with the exploitation of
technology to improve TST. This article is intended to analyze the recent literature published between January 2015
and January 2020 for the computational intelligence (Cl) based simulation approaches and Cl-based approaches for
optimizing TST and Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems, provide insights, research gaps and possible directions for

future work for researchers interested in the field.

Methods: In analyzing the complex dynamic behavior of traffic streams, simulation tools have a prominent place.
Nowadays, microsimulation tools are frequently used in TST related researches. For this reason, a critical review of
some of the widely used microsimulation packages is provided in this paper.

Conclusion: Our review also shows that approximately 77% of the papers included, utilizes a microsimulation tool
in some form. Therefore, it seems useful to include a review, categorization, and comparison of the most
commonly used microsimulation tools for future work. We conclude by providing insights into the future of

research in these areas.

1 Introduction

One of the biggest challenges for urban management
is managing and mitigating traffic congestion. The
number of vehicles in the urban network increasing
day to day basis, which results in deterioration of
traffic conditions. Due to this increase, blockage and
long queues of vehicles form at intersections, leading
commuters to lose valuable time, especially during
rush hours. Apart from this, congestion of traffic also

has detrimental effects on the health, environment,
and the state’s economy.

As to health, traffic congestion causes excessive fa-
tigue, mental illnesses, and problems related to car-
diovascular systems, such as the respiratory system
and nervous system, resulting in a lower standard of
life. Different pollutants are added to the environment
through the heavy use of automobiles, which are one
of the main reasons for different health-related issues
and ecological damages [1, 2]. Environmentally, con-
gestion of traffic leads to increased noise and air pol-
lution [3, 4].

In terms of economy, it decelerates the transportation
rate of services and goods’ merchandising, the conse-
quences of which have to be borne by the consumers in
terms of higher prices. Due to the aforementioned facts,
there is always a need for an effective methodology that
can tackle congestion resulting from the contemporary
demand for urban traffic [5].

One of the main purposes of signal timing settings
is to move people safely and efficiently through an
intersection. Achieving this goal requires an accom-
modation plan to different users that assign the right-
of-way. The plan should be able to adapt according
to the fluctuations in demand. Many signal timing pa-
rameters affect the performance of the intersection.
These parameters include cycle length, green time,
change interval, phase sequencing, etc. These parame-
ters are further defined under section 3.1. Regulating
the timing of the traffic signals is one of the fastest
and most economical ways to curtail congestion at
the intersection and improve traffic flow in urban
streets. Therefore it is necessary to update the timing
of the traffic signal control (TSC) system to cope with
the prevailing urban traffic conditions [6-8].

Researchers have been working on the use of nu-
merous approaches for optimizing TST. Several
good quality reviews have been written previously
within the problem area of TST or TSC settings [9,
10]. are the two most recently published survey pa-
pers published in the year 2015, covering different
methodological areas utilized until 2014 in this
problem field [9]. reviewed the work, concentrating
solely on fuzzy logic strategies whereas [10] shed
light on fuzzy logic as well as some of the important
work of Q-learning, & neural network approaches
used in the domain of TSC setting [5, 11, 12]. are
some of the other review papers covering the appli-
cation of frequently used Cl-based methodologies
for controlling the flow of traffic at the urban traffic
networks. But in terms of technological advance-
ment, the period from January 2015 to January 2020
is huge and significantly important. There is a
dearth of a good literature review paper that should
cover the literature published in these years regard-
ing TSC and TST settings.

The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the research methodology
of the paper, section 3 covers the background of the
TST while giving the structural design of TST and a
review of some frequently used microsimulation
tools respectively. Section 4 comprises a classifica-
tion of TST optimization approaches along with a
concise review of the related approaches. The dis-
cussion and the analysis of approaches are presented

2 Research methodology

This article analyzes the recent literature for the
simulation-optimization, and Cl-based approaches for
optimizing TST and TSC systems, which have been
published from January 2015 to January 2020 in
terms of journal papers and conference proceedings.
One of the main reasons for covering the research
that has been published in the most recent years is
technological advancement. These publications were
selected by meticulously browsing through databases
including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and
Google Scholar. Keywords used to explore the data-
bases were: “TST optimization”, “traffic congestion
optimization”, “TSC settings”, “microscopic _ traffic
simulation-based optimization (SimOpt)”, “dynamic
traffic management system’, and “signalized urban
intersection”. From the reference list of selected publi-
cations, further publications were added, which were
published in the above mentioned period. Table 1
and Table 2 lists the search parameters used in this
study and the total number of papers that we have,
respectively.

Table 2 also illustrates the fact that several studies
with one of the key phrases, i.e. TST optimization,
has seen a significant increase over the past years,
due to the continuous advancement in technology
and the increasing number of vehicles on urban traf-
fic. In shortlisting, only the studies about TST and
TSC have been included, which are either dealing
with one of the parameters or the combination of
them. These parameters include cycle length of the
traffic signal, green phase timing of the traffic signal,
offset and phase sequencing of the traffic signal. Stud-
ies that are related to the connected vehicles, pedes-
trians, simulation model calibration, as well as
macroscopic and mesoscopic traffic simulation are ex-
cluded from this study. Figure 1 illustrates the num-
ber of publications included in this study after
shortlisting.

The shortlisted publications have been further
classified into two categories, that are “microsimula-
tion-based optimization models” and “computational
intelligence models”. In the 1st category, papers in-
tegrated any one of the microsimulation tools for
solving the TST problem with the proposed strat-
egy, are included. Whereas, the papers in the 2nd
category uses some sort of an estimation function
to evaluate potential solutions during the search
process, in the hope of finding an optimal or near-
optimal solution. Some of the papers in this cat-
egory also employed a microsimulation tool but only

for the demonstration of the solution approach (see

Microsimulation tools are frequently used in TST re-
lated researches. Our review also shows that approxi-
mately 77% of the papers included in this study utilizes a
microsimulation tool. There is a wide range of microsi-
mulation tools available and utilized for research. There-
fore, it is useful to include a review, categorization, and
comparison of the most commonly used microsimula-
tion tools for future work.

3 Background on traffic signal timing

This section sketches out the idea around which the set-
tings and the evaluation of TST and the controllers re-
volve. In subsection 3.1, we describe the important
parameters of TST. Understanding of TSC’s structural
design is provided in section 3.2. Lastly, section 3.3 pre-
sents a critical review of the most commonly used
microsimulation tools along with their common and
unique features.

3.1 Traffic signal timing parameters

One of the main purposes of TST settings is to move
people safely and efficiently through an intersection by
assigning the right-of-way. Some of the TST setting pa-
rameters should be able to adapt to the fluctuations in
traffic demand and some should be controlled by the
traffic management authority. These control parameters
are

Signalized Urban Intersection

e Green Time: The time duration in seconds, during
which a given traffic movement at signalized
intersection proceed at a saturation flow rate

e Cycle Length: Time required by a signal to complete
one cycle.

e Phase Sequence: The order of the signal phases
during the signal cycle.

e Change Interval: It is also known as the clearance
interval. It is the interval of yellow and red signal
timing between phases of traffic signals to provide
clearance at an intersection before the onset of
conflicting traffic movements.

e Offset: The relationship between coordinated phases
in terms of time.

The number of stopped vehicles and the delay can be
reduced by increasing the green phase timing for a par-
ticular movement. However, an increase in the green
time of one traffic movement usually occurs at the ex-
pense of increased delay and the number of stopped ve-
hicles in other movements. Therefore, a good signal
timing plan is one that allocates time so that overall traf-
fic performance, eg. average wait delay time, is
optimized.

3.2 Structural Design of Traffic Signal Control

Traffic signal control (TSC) strategies have been classi-
fied into fixed-time, adaptive, and actuated control strat-
egies [5, 13, 14]. The main reason behind this

classification is the type of data and the algorithms they
employ to optimize traffic signal plan.

Fixed time TSC strategies are mainly appropriate
for the traffic signals, where the flow of traffic is
somewhat stable and consistent. Based on previously
observed traffic data, these strategies make use of off-
line optimization algorithms for TST and end up with
predetermined cycle length, split setting plan. The
main objective of this strategy is to achieve an overall
goal, such as minimizing average delay, maximizing
the capacity of a network, etc. [15, 16] developed the
initial models, which laid down the foundation of
fixed-time traffic control strategies by minimizing the
average delay. As the traffic system is exceptionally
dynamic in urban areas, any small disturbance in
terms of a traffic collision, construction work, etc.
can suddenly alter traffic volumes and render the
overall performance of a predetermined traffic signal
plan insufficient.

On the contrary to fixed-time control strategies, the
main aim of the adaptive control strategies is to
optimize the TST plan according to the present-time
traffic situations in every phase. Hence the use of
sensor technologies came into practice. Initial sensor
technologies were capable of discerning vehicular
presence when they cross it.

Later on, visual systems came into heavy use. The ac-
tuated control strategies also use sensors and the actu-
ated controller decides the cycle length based on past
information. Whereas the adaptive strategies are the
modified form of actuated control, which uses the

present data to predict the cycle length of real-time traf-
fic conditions. These sensors are placed at every road
within the bounds of the signalized network. However,
these strategies cannot perform as much detailed ana-
lysis as the fixed time strategies, because they have to
regulate traffic signal plans instantly [17].

The traffic systems, especially in urban areas, are
exceptionally dynamic. Any small disturbance can
suddenly alter traffic volumes. So, it is more beneficial
if the system is capable of reducing traffic congestion
in real-time. Now in today’s world, with the use of
sensor technologies and additional strategies, the col-
lection of data in real-time is no more a challenging
task. With the abundance of data and the use of
available computational power, instant traffic manage-
ment, or prediction of traffic scenarios can be
possible.

3.3 Review of frequently used microsimulation tools

Although analytical models are useful in terms of
providing insights into more general system behavior,
simulation tools have a prominent place in analyzing
responses of traffic systems under a variety of condi-
tions. A tool like simulation is very helpful in traffic
engineering to analyze the complex dynamic behavior
of a traffic stream. Simulation can be defined as the
imitation of real-world systems or processes for con-
veniently acquiring the information through analogous
traffic flow models. These models assist in describing
the physical propagation of the flow of traffic. The
use of traffic simulation models is crucial for a
Qadri et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:55

comprehensive investigation of the urban transporta-
tion system in a safe and suitable environment.

As a whole, traffic simulation can be dichotomized
broadly into microscopic and macroscopic approaches.
The microscopic simulation approach contemplates
the individual behavior of the driver along with the
interaction with other vehicles or pedestrians, whereas
the macroscopic approach considers the vehicular
flow as a whole. Mesoscopic is another approach,
which is the hybrid of the previously mentioned ap-
proaches. AIMSUN, CORSIM, MATSim, Paramics,
SUMO, VISSIM are some of the widely used microsi-
mulation packages for exploring the wide array of dy-
namic problems in urban traffic. There is a large
number of papers included in this study dealing with
microsimulation in some form (either evaluation or as
a part of the model). Therefore authors at this stage,
consider it necessary to discuss the characteristics of
some of the most commonly used microsimulation
packages for the readers.

Ratrout and Rahman [18] evaluated the attributes
and characteristics of various commonly used traffic
simulation packages and also provided the relative
analysis by focusing on some special features. They
found VISSIM, AIMSUN, and CORSIM suitable for
modeling features like arterial, freeway congestion,
and integrated network of freeways and streets, and
AIMSUN, CORSIM, and PARAMICS for intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) [19]. compared the re-
sults of TransModeler, AIMSUN, and VISSIM at an

border cities.

We categorize and compare the seven most widely
used microsimulation tools based on eleven (11)
features and present the results in Table 3. Con-
cerning the graphical user interface (GUI), all of the
above-mentioned packages are found to be equally
user-friendly and adequate. For the lane closures
and the modeling of work zones, TransModeler has
great advantages over AJIMSUN and VISSIM. In
terms of the decision modeling of vehicular routing,
VISSIM allows easy input of a large amount of data
through Excel spreadsheets. AIMSUN, VISSIM, and
SUMO are the simulation tools that allow the user
to build and control models with an application pro-
gramming interface (API) by an external program-
ming language. The “AIMSUN Next” by AIMSUN
provide the toolkit for the automation of task through
programming environment. Whereas, Component Ob-
ject Model (COM) and Traffic Control Interface
(TraCI) are the programming interfaces provided by
VISSIM and SUMO respectively. The availability of a
hierarchical VISSIM-COM object model makes it eas-
ier to code a network with VISSIM as compared to
SUMO. Previously AIMSUN did not have any feature
of API. One of the most prominent features of AJM-
SUN Next is its speed, which provides its supremacy
to all other current microscopic simulation tools. Say-
ing AIMSUN tried to overcome all of its shortcom-
ings through AIMSUN Next would not be wrong.

B Simulation Tools Used

Except for AIMSUN Next, it is recommended that the
modeler must have moderate knowledge about pro-
gramming on Python, C++, or VBA while using VISS
IM and SUMO for modeling, otherwise, AJMSUN
might be the optimal one. Except for the MatSim, all
of the above-mentioned microsimulation tools provide
the facility for both 2D and 3D visualization.

Figure 2 indicates that, within the search parame-
ters used in this paper, researchers have chosen VISS
IM and SUMO (either for evaluation or as a part of
the model) over all other available microsimulation
tools in their research published over the last five
years. This is a clear proof of the superiority in the
usage of both software. The number of times these
tools are used is also mentioned at the top of each
bar.

4 Categorization of methodologies for traffic
signal timing settings

Traffic signal control is one of the most efficient
methods for urban traffic management, providing a
smoother and more secure traffic flow at every
intersection. From the time when the simple auto-
matic signal controller has been introduced, the
TSC system has been going through interminable
improvements to address the factors that cause im-
pediments in TSC. Some of these impediments are
inadequate transport infrastructure, an increasing
number of vehicles, weather conditions, traffic net-
work structure, etc. Each cause is notable in itself
and has the full potential to generate congestion at
any time in the network. As a whole, mitigating
traffic congestion caused by these reasons is a

 

challenging, complex, and nonlinear stochastic prob-
lem for engineers and researchers to solve [5]. In
the following subsections, we review traffic signal
control papers in two major categories. These are
papers utilizing “microSimOpt (Microsimulation-
Based Optimization) models” and “computational
intelligence (CI) models”. Each subsection includes a
detailed table summarizing papers belonging to that
subsection based on several carefully selected pa-
rameters. These parameters are context/objectives,
methods and parameters employed, type of intersec-
tion studied, control system strategy, source of data,
micro-simulation tool used as well as additional
comments.

In section 4.1, researches on the SimOpt model
with a focus on microscopic traffic simulation are
introduced. The analysis of papers using CI methods
is given in section 4.2. If one of the studies included
in this review can be categorized into more than
one (sub)section, it is included in the section based
on the most dominant approach.

4.1 Microsimulation-based optimization model

SimOpt, in general, is regarded as a field in which
the optimization techniques are integrated with simu-
lation analysis [20]. The reason for doing this is to
find the best decision variable values among all pos-
sibilities without explicitly evaluating (simulating)
each possibility [21]. In this sub-section, papers in
which a microsimulation tool is integrated with the
proposed strategy for solving the TST problem and
have been utilized as an evaluation function in an
optimization loop are reviewed.  Simulation-
Qadri et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:55

optimization for TST is important because evaluating
the effects of minor changes in decision variables re-
garding TST can be assessed accurately through
microsimulation without actual implementation. For
understanding the concept; the proposed strategy/al-
gorithm asks the microsimulation model of the net-
work to evaluate the current solution and the results
from each simulation run are fed back to the pro-
posed algorithm until some stopping criterion(a). Re-
searchers have used numerous approaches of CI
methods along with traffic simulation tools in the
domain of TSC. These approaches include but not
limited to machine learning approaches, fuzzy logic,
and computational strategies such as Evolutionary
Computation (EC), Swarm Intelligence (SI), and other
population based-metaheuristic algorithms.

Optimization of TST is a complex problem yet
cost-effective to mitigate traffic congestion and to
smooth the vehicular traffic flow. This optimization
problem has been widely addressed in the context
of stochastic equilibrium network design with differ-
ent approaches like deterministic and _ heuristic
methods. Due to the presence of a large number of
local optimum points in the convoluted solution
space of the problem, deterministic approaches like
gradient-based methods are not effective. On the
other hand, despite the nonconvex nature of the
problem, heuristic approaches like the Genetic Algo-
rithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are
quite successful in the exploration of the search
space. However, they may spend a comparatively
long time in finding the global optimum solution. In
the next subsections, categorization, and evaluation
of recent literature on simulation-optimization based
TST approaches are given.

The detailed analysis of the researches published
over the past five years is included in Appendix 1.
Below the categorization and evaluation of relevant
recent literature based on SimOpt. approaches are
presented.

4.1.1 Artificial intelligence-based approaches

The papers [22-28] are employed a type of artificial
learning algorithm for solving the TST problem.
Among these studies, Neural Networks, Adaptive
Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, Q-Learning, fuzzy
logic, and Deep Reinforcement learning are the
adapted machine learning algorithms. Different objec-
tives have been used in these studies including
minimization of average delay [22, 27], total travel
time [24, 25], average queue length [26], optimization
of TST plan [23], and maximization of the flow rate
[28].

Page 7 of 23

Araghi, et al. [22] utilized a different nature-
inspired algorithm called the cuckoo search algorithm
for the first time to tune the parameters of intelli-
gent controller optimally. The Intelligent controllers
implemented in this study were a Neural Network
(NN) and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System
(ANFIS). The fuzzy logic-based control system devel-
oped by Jin, et al. [23] was capable of providing traf-
fic light indication during real-time operations after
receiving the messages from the signal controller
hardware. The signal control and optimization tool-
boxes were integrated into the software embedded in
the controller’s device. In [24] Araghi et al. assessed
the performance of three meta-heuristic algorithms,
which were Simulated Annealing (SA), GA, and the
CS on a complex advanced interval type-2 adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system (IT2ANFIS) based traf-
fic signal controller. Mileti¢é et al. [25] compared the
effectiveness of two different approaches used in pre-
mature traffic light control systems through six dif-
ferent scenarios of microsimulation models using
real-time data. The first method used in the com-
parison was operated by fixed values for vehicle ar-
rival time and queue length ranges, while the second
was based on fuzzy logic and, therefore it was more
adaptive.

4,1.2 Metaheuristics based approaches

Reference numbers [29-34] employ meta-heuristic
methods for optimization along with a  micro-
simulation tool. Among the meta-heuristics imple-
mentations, population-based methods were mostly
employed, where PSO, ACO, and GA are the most
heavily utilized methods. In addition to some com-
mon objectives that are mentioned in the previous
sub(section), Elgarej et al. [32, 33] came up with a
different objective of finding the shortest effective
green time.

Gokce et al. [29], Dabiri and Abbas [30], Panovski
and Zaharia [31], Chuo et al. [35] utilized PSO for
the fulfillment of their objectives. Among them, [29]
is the only study that has been carried out for the
signalized roundabout containing 28 signal heads,
whereas [30, 31] worked on optimizing the arterial
traffic signals having three intersections and the is-
sues related with traffic flow management in the
urban areas respectively. Jintamuttha, et al. [33] pro-
posed a finite-interval model to achieve the objective
regarding TST. A different swarm-based algorithm,
Bat algorithm, was utilized to relax the computa-
tional complexity. Chuo et al. [35] developed a
multiple-intersection TST system. PSO with the small
adjustment was employed for the consistency of the
results.
Qadri et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:55

4.1.3 Multi-objective based approaches

Nguyen et al. [36], Hatri and Boumhidi [37], Zheng
et al. [38] are the only papers that employ a multi-
objective simulation-optimization approach. Although
a relevant approach, there seems to be a research
void in implementing multi-objective SimOpt for the
TST problem.

Nguyen et al. [36] integrated a local search (LS)
algorithm with the iterations of NSGA-II in a way
that the output of LS was becoming the next gener-
ation’s parents in their study. Results of the pro-
posed NSGA-II-LS were compared with NSGA-II
and multi-objective differential evolutionary algo-
rithms and found that the proposed algorithm was
better than the other two approaches and good
simulation results were achievable in the early phase
of the optimization procedure. To balance the
equity and efficiency of traffic flow in the urban
network Zheng et al. [38] presented a bi-objective
stochastic SimOpt approach. Two types of surrogate
models were also used to capture the mapping rela-
tionship between decision variables and objectives.
VISSIM was used to model the case study network
and the results demonstrated that the proposed
model outperformed three other counterparts in-
cluding NSGA- II.

4.1.4 Bi-level programming based approaches

There are only two studies [39, 40] that employed a
bi-level programming approach, where signal settings
are determined by the upper and _ lower level
optimization tasks. With an objective function of
maximizing the weighted trip, Hajbabaie and Beneko-
hal in [39] formulated a program to optimize TST
and system optimal traffic assignment simultaneously.
By relaxing network loading and traffic assignment
constraints, the study also proposed a framework for
the calculation of the upper-bound value of the ob-
jective function.

To obtain the optimal TST setting, Li et al. [40]
designed a framework in such a way that the settings
of traffic signals were determined by the upper level.
The upper level was intended to minimize the aver-
age travel time of drivers, whereas the task for
achieving the network’s equilibrium was attained by
the lower level through the settings provided by the
upper level.

4.1.5 Miscellaneous approaches

References [41-48] employ a mathematical
optimization method along with micro-simulation.
The methods employed range from dynamic program-
ming to backpressure to optimal control. These ap-
proaches are more likely to be useful for design phase

Page 8 of 23

problems rather than operational, due to the difficul-
ties involved in solving them for large instances in an
acceptable amount of time. Based on a dynamic pro-
gramming approach with NEMA configuration, the
real-time signal control algorithm was formulated by
Chen et al. [41]. Dakic et al. [43] also proposed two
signal control algorithms based on the backpressure
model to maximize throughput through an urban
traffic network. These two models were initialized
and modified backpressure. Results revealed that the
proposed algorithms outperformed the fixed time and
actuated control strategies

To deal with the reliable TSC problem, Chen
et al. [45] presented an approach in which the
higher-order distributional information that was de-
rived from a stochastic microscopic simulator was
used. The TSC problem was based on a linear com-
bination of the expectation of total travel time and
its standard deviation. For enhancing the computa-
tional efficiency of the algorithm, the analytical ap-
proximation of the simulated metrics was combined
with the simulated data. According to the authors,
such kinds of approaches can be utilized to inform
the design and operation of the transportation
system.

4.2 Computational intelligence based models

The researches, which incorporates the Cl-based ap-
proaches, are analyzed in this section. Papers in this
section, use some sort of an estimation function to
evaluate potential solutions during the search
process, in the hope of finding an optimal or near-
optimal solution. Some of the papers also utilize
microsimulation tools. But the usage of microsimula-
tion tools here is not for the development of the
proposed solution but rather to demonstrate possible
or potential benefits of the proposed solution. In this
category, the approaches like fuzzy models, neural
networks, machine learning algorithms, evolutionary
computation (EC), swarm intelligence (SI), and other
population-based metaheuristic algorithms are dis-
cussed. Similar to Appendix 1, Appendix 2 presents a
detailed analysis of work in this field under the same
categories.

One of the strategies to optimize the traffic in
urban areas is the use of ITS, which implements the
CI method to facilitate problem-solving that previ-
ously seemed very difficult. CI is a collection of
“intelligence” methods, including evolutionary com-
puting, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks with

a claim of being the successor of Artificial
Intelligence [49]. Moreover, CI can also capitalize on
other approaches, like swarm intelligence and

reinforcement learning, etc.

The inspiration for both EC and SI algorithms often
comes from nature, like biological evolution. Classical
ECs, encompass evolution strategies, evolutionary pro-
gramming, GA, and genetic programming (GP). They
all are metaheuristic optimization techniques for find-
ing the optimal or near-optimal solutions to the non-
linear complex problem within an acceptable time
limit. They imitate natural processes, such as natural
evolution under the principle of fit or adapted to the
environmental condition best, well known as the
phenomenon of the survival of the fittest [49]. The
origin of SI algorithms is from the behaviors of some
social living beings such as birds, ants, and fishes
[50]. The main strength of SI based research mainly
depends on two families of algorithm namely ant col-
ony optimization and particle swarm optimization.
They all are very successful in various kinds of
optimization problems.

One of the motivations behind the development of
EC was the growing demand for robust automated
problem solvers in the second half of the twentieth
century, which should apply to a wide range of prob-
lems without the need for much tailoring, along with
satisfactory performance [51]. Montana et al. [52]
presented one of the initial works through an evolu-
tionary approach for intelligent TSC. A hybrid ap-
proach of GA and strongly typed GP [53] was
employed to optimize fixed cycle signal timings. On
the comparison, of both the strategies for three small
different network settings, it was found that in all
the cases, GP’s performance was better than that of
GA. These were some details of the preeminent early
work that came into the category of ClI-based
optimization for TST. The detailed summaries of the
work that fits with our literature search parameters
are given in Appendix 2. This table reflects the di-
versity of TST optimization in terms of solution
methodology and lists the details of recently pub-
lished research.

Below the categorization and evaluation of relevant re-
cent literature are presented based on CI methods
utilized.

4.2.1 Artificial intelligence-based approaches
A variety of different Al-based methods [54-61] were
used for eliminating bottlenecks or to increase the
throughput at the signalized intersections.

Xiang and Chen [54] proposed a Back Propagation
neural network-based Grey Qualitative Reinforcement
Learning algorithm to eliminate bottlenecks and to avoid
reducing traffic flow and timing plan function relation-
ships. Benhamza et al. [55] used a multi-agent frame-
work for the development of an adaptive TST scheme

Page 9 of 23

for multiple intersections. In the developed scheme, each
intersection was managed by an autonomous agent.

Vidhate et al. [56] and Genders et al. [57] modeled
TSC using the RL algorithm based on real-time traf-
fic data whereas Liang et al. [58] proposed a deep RL
model to decide the TST and to control the cycle
length of traffic signal based on the data collected
through different sensors. Ozan et al. [61] presented
a modified RL algorithm that was based on Q-
Learning. The algorithm was further combined with
Transfyt-7F for finding the optimal TST of the coor-
dinated network. The proposed approach was better
than other RL based algorithms because of its ability
to produce a sub-environment in each learning event.
The similarity in terms of size was kept constant
among the new and the original environment using
the best solution obtained from the previous learning
event.

A decentralized TSC strategy based on the data
collected from sensors was introduced by Bemas
et al. [59]. A neuroevolution strategy was used to im-
prove the coupling configuration of the introduced
NN and SUMO was employed for the extensive
microsimulation based investigation of the proposed
model.

4,2.2 Metaheuristics based approaches

Metaheuristic approaches are one of the widely imple-
mented by researchers in the optimization of TSC strat-
egies. References [62—75] implemented metaheuristic
algorithms such as SI, SA, GA, Bee colony, memetic al-
gorithm, PSO, differential evolution, HS, etc. Our ana-
lysis shows that the population-based algorithms are the
most widely used metaheuristic algorithms in optimizing
TSC strategies.

Li et al. [62] presented a hybrid solution algorithm
for arterial TST optimization based on SA and GA.
Gao et al. [63] and Gao et al. [72] considered the
scheduling of urban traffic light as the model-based
optimization problem. To solve this problem, the
discrete harmony search algorithm was employed in
[63], whereas, five metaheuristics were implemented
in [72]. Bie et al. [64], Guo et al. [71] and Tan et al.
[65] developed GA to optimize the TST settings of
the respective networks and objective functions. Jova-
novic et al. [66] used the BC algorithm to solve TST
of isolated intersection in an undersaturated and
oversaturated traffic conditions.

To control the flow of traffic, Manandhar and Joshi
[68] developed a hybrid system that incorporated the
Statistical Multiplexing technique and PSO. Based on
PSO Tarek et al. [67] also developed a TST control
strategy for the signalized roundabout that was com-
bined with the three different sub-controllers.
Qadri et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:55

4.2.3 Multi-objective based approaches

Due to conflict among different objectives of TST
optimization, some of the research in the literature con-
sidered multi-objective models to optimize the TST
problem. References [76-78] refer to the problem of
TST optimization with multi-objective models.
Optimization of traffic capacity was the common object-
ive among the above-mentioned studies. Other than this,
popular objectives were the minimization of vehicle
delay, stopping time, and vehicle emission.

Yu et al. [76] employed a fuzzy compromise pro-
gramming approach. In this approach, different weight
coefficients were assigned to various optimization ob-
jectives. These weights could be different depending
on the states of the traffic flow ratio. After assigning
the weights, the multi-objective function was con-
verted to a single objective which was solved through
GA. Zhao et al. [77] and Jia et al. [78] used PSO with
some improvement for their multi-objective TST
models.

4.2.4 Dynamic, MILP & non-linear programming based
approaches

References, [79-83] formulated the TST optimization
problem as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
whereas references [84, 85] presented as the non-linear
programming models

Countering the oversaturated condition problem of
TSC, He et al. [79] introduced the partial grade separ-
ation at a_ signalized intersection. A  lane-based
optimization model for lane configuration and TST set-
tings was formulated as MILP, which was solved by
branch and bound method. Mehrabipour et al. [80] also
modeled TST of network-level as MILP. To find the
near-optimal TST parameters, a rolling horizon solution
methodology was developed. Based on the vehicle trajec-
tory data in urban road networks, Yan et al. [82] formu-
lated a network-level multiband signal coordination
scheme as MILP to provide progression bands for major
traffic streams. For optimizing TST parameters Kohler
et al. [81] presented an approach based on a cyclically
time-expanded network model. The model was able to
optimize traffic assignment problems at the same time.
The MILP model was for optimizing the control
parameters.

Mohebifard et al. [84] formulated the network-level
TST optimization problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-
Linear Program (MINLP) which was based on the
Cell Transmission Model (CTM) and presented a cus-
tomized methodology to solve it with a tight optimal-
ity gap. Yu et al. [85] put forward a_ non-linear
programming model for an optimal TSC setting. A
new aspect of this model was combining the double
queue traffic flow model to the signal-controlled

Page 10 of 23

traffic network to record the traffic dynamics and
queue spillback in real-time. In [86] a convex (quad-
ratic) programming approach was utilized to optimize
the pedestrian as well as vehicular TST at an isolated
intersection.

4.2.5 Miscellaneous approaches

References [87-100] present miscellaneous approaches
to optimize TST settings and TSC strategies. These
approaches include stochastic programming, semi-
analytic, stage-based sequencing, elimination pairing,
etc.

A multi-stage stochastic program for the adaptive
TSC system, which was based on phase clearance reli-
ability, was proposed by Ma et al. [87]. In the first
stage, a base timing plan that included the cycle
length and green timing of each phase was developed,
while in the second stage, the green splits and offsets
were adapted to the current traffic conditions. Differ-
ent from the existing methods, Jiao et al. [88] pro-
posed a model that was intended to minimize average
delay time per person, rather than the delay of vehi-
cles from traffic intersection. In the first stage, the
curves of the accumulative arriving and departing ve-
hicles were fitted and the delay functions of the vehi-
cles were formulated during each phase of the signal.
Subsequently, the delay time of the vehicle was
shifted to personal delay time, taking into account the
passenger load of the vehicles. This personal delay
time was further employed as the objective function
and proposed a TST optimization model for attaining
real-time signal parameters. Simoni et al. [89] intro-
duced a Hamilton—Jacobi formulation to model the
TST over the arterial road based on the Lighthill
Whitham Richards model.

Keeping the focus on Network Signal Setting Design,
Memoli et al. [90] introduced scheduled
synchronization. This scheduled synchronization in-
cluded the scheduling of green phase timing and
synchronization to a single optimization problem. The
stage-based method was proposed to solve the problem,
which was the extension of the synchronization method
and the flow model of traffic. Eriskin et al. [91] proposed
a new method, elimination pairing system, for designing
TST at the oversaturated condition. Afdelghaffar et al.
presented the idea of an isolated and adaptable decentra-
lized cycle free TST controller in [92, 93]. The
optimization of TST was achieved through the Nash-
Bargaining game theory approach. Wu et al. [96] pre-
sented a distributed TSC strategy for the traffic lights in
the network. Tang et al. [97] formulated a non-
centralized TSC paradigm to control phase timing based
on fog computing.

5 Discussion

5.1 Analysis of findings

TST optimization is a difficult and complex problem to
solve. It usually involves stochasticity due to the ran-
domness of demand for flow and behavior of players.
Realistic problems’ solution space is so vast that search-
ing for optimal or near-optimal solutions is a challenging
task, to say the least.

Jin et al. [23], Vogel et al [26] developed a fuzzy
logic based traffic light controller for an isolated traf-
fic intersection. Results were very encouraging in
terms of congestion, travel time, etc. But according
to [31, 75] fuzzy logic and machine-learning-based

Fixed Time Control System Strategy

 

Fig. 4 Research publication according to approaches

traffic controllers are not economically feasible and
require a large investment for their configuration and
maintenance. In terms of parameters, it has also been
observed that the offset in the network of intersec-
tions has been targeted for optimization in a very
limited number of studies.

Figure 3 shows that the number of studies using a
SimOpt model over the past 5years is relatively
fewer in number. Our analysis shows that the
population-based algorithms are the most widely
used metaheuristic algorithms in optimizing TSC
strategies. In terms of approaches developed for both
the control strategies that are fixed time and real-

time, the majority of the researchers preferred to
work on fixed time controls over the real-time sys-
tems. Metaheuristic approaches are utilized mostly
for optimization, in 69% of studies with fixed-time
control strategies and 49% of studies with real-time
control strategies. It is also quite clear that the solu-
tion to the problem of optimizing TST lies in the
real-time traffic control strategy that can deal with
the fluctuation of traffic.

We also find out that microsimulation tools are
used at an increasing rate. Among the many available
microsimulation tools, VISSIM and SUMO have been
used in 60% of the studies either for evaluation or as
a part of the model published over the last five years.
This is a clear proof of the superiority in the usage of
both software.

5.1.1 Analytical vs simulation-optimization and Cl methods

As mentioned in section 2, 77% of studies that were
analyzed utilized a microsimulation tool. Besides, we
have also come across some papers utilizing analyt-
ical methods. The search for 2015-2020 resulted in
a total of 10 such papers [76, 84, 88, 91, 101-106]
utilizing an analytical approach. Only 3 papers [84,
103, 105] considered a network problem, and the
remaining 7 considered a single network problem.
But the size of the realistic problems and the
amount of interaction that needs to be included in
the model for them to be interesting, make use of
analytical methods significantly less practical (prom-
ising) for TST problems. Analytical models are use-
ful to gain insights into the problem but getting
useful results is difficult for two reasons. Either the
number of interactions that need to be included in
the model or the solution time required, make use
of these analytical models prohibitive. For these rea-
sons, analytical models are not included in this re-
view paper.

5.1.2 Single vs network of intersections

Traffic is a very much a flow problem. Therefore, it
may not be enough to improve traffic at a single
intersection or roundabout when the next intersec-
tion is blocked. Traffic conditions are very much af-
fected by driver characteristics, roadway conditions,
and environmental conditions. Therefore effective
TST methods should be able to solve for a network
of intersections, representing problematic areas in an
urban setting. Our analysis shows that only about
53.5% of simulation-optimization papers and 54.3% of
CI papers worked on some sort of network of
intersections.

Page 12 of 23

5.1.3 Real-time vs. fixed-time control

Our analysis finds out that, still a significant amount
of research is performed for fixed-time controllers, ra-
ther than real-time controllers. Among simulation-
optimization methods, 63% of papers utilized fixed-
time compared to 37% of papers utilizing real-time
control. For papers in the CI category, 42% of papers
worked on a fixed-time control problem compared to
58% of papers on real-time control.

Furthermore, Fig. 4 epitomizes the types of ap-
proaches developed for both the control strategies
that are fixed time and real-time. We observe the
dominance of Metaheuristic approaches in both strat-
egies and machine learning algorithms, especially for
real-time control.

5.1.4 Signalized roundabouts

Although in many countries, roundabouts used to be
non-signalized, more and more countries are adapting
signalization of roundabouts led by the UK, France,
Sweden, and Turkey [107, 108]. United States Depart-
ment of Transportation Federal Highway Administra-
tion discourages the use of fully _ signalized
roundabouts but also concedes that unexpected de-
mand may require signalization [109, 110]. In any
case, one should expect a significant amount of litera-
ture on the signal timing of roundabouts. We have
come across only two studies [29, 67] on signalized
roundabouts.

5.1.5 Experimentation with realistic conditions

Testing proposed solution methods to TST is im-
portant to truly evaluate its effectiveness. Traffic flow
data is complex and presents particular challenges in
imitating. That is probably one of the reasons, why
there are no well-established data sets that one could
test his/her proposed method, like the ones found,
e.g. for scheduling problems. For this reason, testing
with real-life data is important. From our analysis,
we found that about 44.4% of researches utilizing
simulation-optimization methods tested with real-life
data compared to about 42.2% of research utilizing
CI methods.

5.1.6 Evaluation of solutions

Appendices 1 and 2 list the objective functions used
to compare solutions in search of the best. We find
out that 61% of papers use average delay, average
travel time, queue length, and flow rate (or some
function of them) for this purpose.

5.2 Implications for practice
In this subsection, we summarize some of the implica-
tions for practice from the analysis of findings.
Qadri et al. European Transport Research Review (2020) 12:55

Real-time controllers are more flexible to adapt to
ever-changing requirements. We believe that fixed-
time controllers will have a less practical impact and
therefore more research effort can be expected to
real-time control strategies.

Working with real-time control strategies, with real
data over a large network of intersections all contrib-
ute to already high computational requirements for
solving TST problems. This means difficulty for ana-
lytical approaches and increased utilization of heuris-
tic approaches. There are studies [7, 62, 65, 69, 71,
96, 97], especially under the heading of metaheuristic-
based approaches (subsection 4.2), that utilize heuris-
tics; though these applications are not enough and
most of them found so far, are far away from being
extensively customized. In addition, few utilize cus-
tomized representations and data structures, which
can be crucial in performance. Also due to the nature
of the traffic problem, the management of a large
network of intersections’ TST becomes important. We
realize larger the network, the more difficult solution
or even representation of a solution is.

6 Conclusion, directions for future research

Based on the categorization and analysis of state-of-
art for TST, the authors propose a number of direc-
tions for future research, associated opportunities, and
challenges.

Today’s urban traffic system comes under great
stress during sudden transient peak demand _ that
forms, either with or without prior information. These
events diverge from the regular traffic in important
characteristics; like being transient, specific to a re-
gion, resulting from an emergency, disaster requiring
evacuation, or a large public event. Modeling and so-
lution for TST after such events is a research gap
that must be filled.

Our analysis found out that only two papers dealing
with signalized roundabouts. Roundabouts have a differ-
ent flow dynamic compared to regular intersections.
With the increasing use of signalized roundabouts, espe-
cially in metropolitan areas, we believe TST for signal-
ized roundabouts presents a particular research gap
within this area.

We found that still less than half of the papers on
TST optimization are performed utilizing real-life
data. The lack of standardized data sets and the com-
plexity of traffic flow data suggests studies tested with
real-life data will have more impact in the field.

Although there are studies made using real-life data
and real-time control, there are few or almost no
mention of findings and/or methods being applied or
adapted in real life. One of the important challenges

Page 13 of 23

for the researchers in this area would be getting these
methods to the decision-makers and adapters.

Papers studying fixed time controllers are made to set
the best possible timings for expected traffic flow. The
rest of the studies are made to employ real-time data (ei-
ther using sensors or cameras) and react to the conges-
tion and try to mitigate the resulting problem.

Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in
the advancement of prediction algorithms, computing
power, and the availability of real-time data. These
facts along with advances in the heuristic algorithms
can lead to proactive models, which may now be suc-
cessfully developed. Proactive models can predict a
traffic flow problem before it happens and calculate
necessary changes in the TSC system to either pre-
vent it totally or decrease the adverse effects. These
proactive models may also be combined with a new
area of simulation-optimization. The concept of a
digital twin has been gaining popularity for the manu-
facturing environment. By definition, “Digital twins
integrate internet of things, Al, machine learning, and
software analytics with spatial network graphs to cre-
ate living digital simulation models that update and
change as their physical counterparts change.” [111].
With the aforementioned advances, it is possible and
interesting to apply the idea of a digital twin to an
urban traffic model. The use of a digital twin for the
urban traffic system within the correct framework
may enable estimating possible problems earlier and
lead to an improvement in the computational power
almost real-time.

The great majority of papers found on the relevant
topic singles out traffic signal timing and its effects on
usually average delay and/or emissions. An important
part of heavy traffic intersections, especially in metropol-
itan areas are pedestrians. Except for [86, 98], pedes-
trians and the effect of their behavior are not modeled
into the studies. The same goes for driver behavior. An
important avenue of research would be to analyze the ef-
fects of pedestrian and driver behavior on the models.

There is a big increase in the number of studies
dealing with autonomous vehicles and technologies.
To the best of the author’s knowledge, all these stud-
ies exclusively study the general area of how autono-
mous vehicles, flow in traffic safely and/or efficiently
and/or environmentally friendly, etc. However, we
did not come across studies that benefit from au-
tonomous vehicles and related technologies for TST
optimization. A great majority of research on autono-
mous technologies and TST are studied in rural
highway environments, rather than urban. We believe
there is a research opportunity to study TST in
urban settings with the heavy use of autonomous
vehicles.

The researchers from the transportation field working
in the area of TST are moving towards the imple-
mentation of hybrid algorithms. The main idea be-

especially to reduce complexity and speed up the pro-
cesses so that they can be more useful in optimizing
TST. Sign of addition i.e. “+” between the two differ-
