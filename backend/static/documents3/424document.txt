ABSTRACT

In converters or multilevel inverters it is very important to ensure that
the output of the multilevel inverters waveforms in term of the voltage or
current of the waveforms is smooth and without distortion. The artificial
neural network (ANN) technique to obtaining proper switching angles
sequences for a uniform step asymmetrical modified multilevel inverter by
eliminating specified higher-order harmonics while maintaining the required
fundamental voltage and current waveform. However, through this paper a
modified CHB-MLI are proposed using artificial intelligence optimization
technique based on modulation selective harmonic elimination (SHE-PWM).
A most powerful modulation technique that used to minimize a harmonic
contants during the outout waveform of multilevel inverter is a SHE-PWM
method. The proposed a five-level modified cascaded H-bridge multilevel
inverter (M-CHBMI) with ANN controller to improve the output voltage and
current performance and achieve a lower total harmonic distortion (THD).
The main aims of this paper cover design, modeling, prediction for real-time
generation of optimal switching angles in a single-phase topology of
modified five level CHB-MLI. Due to the heavy cost of computation to
solving transcendental nonlinear equations with specified number, a real-time
application of selective harmonic elimination-pulse width modulation (SHE-
PWM) technique is limited. SHE equations known as a transcendental
nonlinear equation that contain trigonometric functions. The prototype of a 5-
level inverter in digital signal processing (DSP) TMS320F2812 reveals that
the proposed method is highly efficient for harmonic reduction in modified
multilevel inverter.

1. INTRODUCTION

The switching semiconductor devices with high power handling capability real-time multilevel
power conversion has become a rapidly growing area of power electronics with good potential for further
development. In multilevel inverter can be generate Ac voltage based on Dc source from PV, winding and
battery application. The multilevel inverter has three advantage, converted Dc to Ac voltage, reduce total
harmonic distortion (THD) and less number of switches component [1, 2]. In multilevel inverter have been
three type of topologies clamped capacitor (DC) flying capacitor (FC) cascaded H-bridge (CHB) [3].
The structure of multilevel inverter for consist eight switching drive can be generated five level inverters.
Therefore, increase number of switching PWM leads to increase output voltage level and then leads to high
cost for circuit [4]. However, the multilevel inverter has limitation harmonic order in 7-level 3th, 5th by using
optimization technique are PSO, NR and GA algorithms are present in [5]. In nine level multilevel inverter

with phase disposition (PD) PWM scheme can be generated waveform voltage based on transistor clamped
H-Bridge multilevel inverter (TCHB), with Dc supply equal SOOV signal frequency is 50Hz,
modulation index and currier frequency 2000Hz in this circuit done by simulation MATLAB for produce
lower (THD) [6].

The harmonic elimination technique applies to multilevel inverter of seven and eleven level for
elimination 3th, 5th and 3th, 5th and 7th respectively have been explanation in [7]. For optimization control
have different type can be applied to multilevel inverter to optimized switching angle for capability of THD
minimization. The optimization PSO and GA and HSA techniques have been used for computing switching
angle via solved non-liner transcendental equation drive from selective harmonic elimination (SHE) for
output voltage based on 7-level cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter have been present in [8]. The (SHE)
considered low-frequency technique in order to elimination 3th and 5th based on 7-level inverter with
different modulation index (MI) equal to 0.65-1.0, the optimum harmonic reduction have been present in [9].
PSO algorithm implementation for decrease THD of CHB-MLI compare five and seven level, can be observe
that THD for 7-level much better than 5-level inverter have been live in [10-12]. according to
the conventional circuit using in CHB-MLI consist eight switching PWM for produce five level inverter and
then twelve switching PWM for generate seven level inverters [12, 13]. The iteration solved number of
switching angle by non-linear equation was achieve by PSO technique.

The optimization switching angle by PSO technique equal 3 angles based on 7-level inverter with
reduce harmonic distortion 3th and 5th odd has monic order. NR and PSO have been achieve by excremental
and simulation result [15]. The improvement of outpout voltage quality for both of symmetrical and
asymmetrical MLI types of MLI, both are very effective and efficient to reduced the number of switching
devices for conventional and non-conventional Hybrid MLI topologies to create a specified output stepped
number of voltage levels with more effect operating and higher voltage levels based on DC voltage supply
[16-18]. The ANN controller has been covered design, and analysis prototype of prediction to generate
a real-time of optimal switching angles in a single-phase topology of modified five level CHB-MLI.

artificial neural network (ANN) controller has been improve the output voltage and current performance and
achieve a lower total harmonic distortion (THD). The study is designed the hardware of 5-level M-CHBMI
using DSP-TMS320F2812 and to develop a proposed ANN controller algorithm for the 5-level CHBMI to
achieve lower output voltage and current THD and improve the output voltage and current performance.

(2) has s variables (6,,0,), where 0< 6,<0,<m/2, and a solution set is obtained by assigning
a specific value to the fundamental component, Vf, and equating s-1 harmonics to zero as given below:

V,cos(@,) + V,cos(@,) 2m _ V,cos(36,) + V,cos(36,) = 0 (3)

where m=Vf/(2Vdc/z), and it is related to the modulation index mi by mi=m/s, where 0<mi<1. An objective
function is then needed for the optimisation procedure selected as a measure of effectiveness of eliminating
selected order of harmonics while maintaining the fundamental component at a pre-specified value.
Therefore, this objective function is defined as: [22-25]

F(O1,05,-++, 6,)=[d3_, V,cos(0,)-m] +[E3_, V,cos(30,)] + , [ds_, V,cos(2s — 1)0,]° (4)

The proper switching angles can be calculated by minimize (4) with condictional of 0<0,<0,<7/2,
in which achieving a required harmonic contants. The main point of the transcendental set of non-linear (3),
that most of iterative techniques can be used in order to acheve a spesifice switching angles as shown in
Figure 4 and each step is explained below. By solving a non-linear transcendental equation with a modulation
index both of angles 8,and 8, can be selected. a modulation index can be obtained be using formula (5).

Where, M is the modulation index other switching angles form 93 until 08 can be obtained based on
first and second switching angles (01 and 02) by indicate of a 5-levels output waveform of a modified
CHB-MLIs as shown in Figure 3. The detection process of configuration and attributes system can be called
as optimization procedure. only a 3th harmonics order should be eliminated. Thus, by solve a transcendental
equation using ANN technique, the switching angle can be found. the switching pattern of 5-levels inverter
are turned on and turned off as its illustrated in Figure 2 with the accurate sequence to control and generate
S1 until S8 in intent provide 5-level waveform of output voltage, based on a M-CHB-MLIs. These switching
angles are calculated then detect and identical of THD that can be given by:

The expect switching angles (a1 and a2) of five-levels with the effected THD and modulation index
is shown in Figure 3. Based in MATLAB code have been created according to sutible iteration number that
can be easily detect a fundamental predicted switching angles for five-levels (81 and 02) based on M=0.949,
However, resultant THD=14.48 % for five-levels.

 

4. ANN CONTROL TECHNIQUE

ANN is a powerful tool to control a nonlinear system that is very complex in nature.
A well-designed ANN can be used to replace the look up table and to generate optimal switching angles in
a real-time manner [26].

The ANN architecture is illustrated by Figure 4, including an input layer with two inputs, a hidden
layer with two hidden neurons, and an output layer with two outputs. A simulink Model is created using
the ANN with delayed feed-back loop as shown in Figure 5. A typical two-layer feed-forward network
shown in Figure 6 with sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons can fit multidimensional mapping
problems arbitrarily well. There are n inputs and vectors P in an input layer, t; sigmoid hidden neurons in
hidden layer, and tz linear output neurons in output layer. ANN controller network structure is defined based
on the number of neurons in the input layer, hidden layer and output layer respectively. The first neuron of
the output layer is used as input to feed the PWM generator to generate switching signal for the proposed
M-CHBMI. The connections weight parameter between jth and ith neuron at mth layer is given by wmij,
while bias parameter of this layer at ith neuron is given by bmi. Transfer function of the network at ith
neuron in mth layer is defined by:

nm = ys" Wiramt + bm
The output function of neuron at mth layer is given by:
aj = f™ (nj")

where f is activation function of the neuron. In this design the activation function of the output layer is unity
and for the hidden layer is a tangent hyperbolic function given by:

5. THE HARDWARE OF MODIFIED FIVE LEVELS CHB-MLI

The hardware of single phase of modified five-level CHB-MLIs has been performing for switching
frequency value of 2500Hz. With single-phase passive load as 20Q, and 5mH. Supplied by dc voltage as
300V.also at this prototype system, each cycle was containing 0.02s as duration time. the switching angles
have been calculated with ANNs technique in which Q1=11.54 and Q2=39.21 with M=0.949 for five levels
single-phase modified CHB-MLIs. In Figure 9, as can be observed of predicted data and original data for
the THD with test values.

The training set is used for computing the gradient and updating the network weight and bias values.
The validation set is used to monitor the error during training process in order to avoid overfitting. The test
set is used to test the training performance Training: R=0.99995as shown in Figure 10. A modified
five-levels CHB-MLI build by merge and involves five devices of power semiconductor
IGBTs-IHW30N90T with snubber circuits, as shown in Figure 11. The operating switching frequency of
IGBT have been procesed with capability of up to 100 kHz and 60A as electric current supply when
a temperature of switching device is 25°C, and becoming 30 A when temperature reached to 100°C.

Training: R-@,90005

Normally, it can operate at 600-volt DC towards the break down voltage at 900-volt DC.
These IGBTs can accept a maximum of+30V gate to emitter voltage pulse. More information pertaining to
this IGBT-IHW30N90T. Besides, the single-phase switching signal to those IGBTs came from the gate
drives circuits. The important aspects in the selection of IGBT had been the voltage of the IGBT collector to
emitter. If the output phase voltage inverter designed had been 300 volts AC (peak to peak), then a voltage
source DC at V2 x 300V or 424.27volt DC would be needed to avoid break down voltage on IGBTs as
the inverter output was loaded with resistance and inductance. Besides, the switching sequence of the voltage
across IGBT had been similar to the voltage DC source. Another aspect was the electric current capacity that
allowed flow through the IGBTs. This means that if the inverter was designed to drive the motor with high
current, then IGBT with high current should be chosen due to its ability in conducting frequency switching.
With high-frequency capability of IGBTs, then high switching frequency, instead of low switching, could be
applied on single-phase five-level of a modified CHB-MLIs so that it could produce output with less
harmonics.

6. OPTIMIZATION EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF A SINGLE PHASE OF FIVE LEVEL
MODIFIED CHB MLIs (MI=0.949)BASED ON ANN AND PSO TECHNIQUES

In the case of mitigation of THD in a modified CHB-MLIs inverter, the SHE-PWM switching
method is used to calculate the values of switching angles from the solution of non-linear transcendental
equations. These non-linear complex equations are minimised by using the ANN and PSO techniques.
In order to determine if both of simulation results and experimental results are in good agreement with each
othe. A source code based on the ANN and PSO techniques for the optimisation of a single-phase modified
CHB-MLIs has been developed.

The developed source code programming was then stored into DSP-TMS320F2812.
The DSP-TMS320F2812 card was then interfaced with the modified prototype for single-phase CHB-MLI
scheme that proposed. In the source code programming, one cycle consists of the duration of 0.02s with
MI=0.949. Meanwhile, the values of the switching angles were calculated using the PSO technique and
the obtained values are @=13.4land @=41.93. by using PSO technique as controller of a proposed
single-phase modified CHB-MLIs comprises switches S1, $2, S3, and S4 and S5 as bi- directional switch as
illustrated in Figure 12. The optimised output waveform for both of voltage and current in a single-phase
five-levels modified CHB-MLIs using the PSO technique are shows in Figure 13. While both of Figure 14
and Figure 15 shows the spectrum of optimised harmonic during output waveform of voltage and current in a
single-phase five-level modified CHB-MLIs in which ratio of THD accomplished to 15.3% and 8.2%
respectively by using the PSO technique. In the next experiment, a prototype of a modified five-level CHB-
MLIs is verified with ANN technique. By using the same models of PSO technique, the switching angles for
optimisation are calculated using the ANN technique.
