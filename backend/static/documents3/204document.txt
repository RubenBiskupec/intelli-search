Abstract

Wearable electronics play a crucial role in advancing the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and as an
attractive future vision, all-in-one wearable microsystems integrating powering, sensing, actuating and other
functional components on a single chip have become an appealing tendency. Herein, we propose a wearable
thermoelectric generator (THEG) with a novel double-chain configuration to simultaneously realize sustainable energy
harvesting and multi-functional sensing. In contrast to traditional single-chain ThEGs with the sole function of thermal
energy harvesting, each individual chain of the developed double-chain thermoelectric generator (DC-ThEG) can be
utilized to scavenge heat energy, and moreover, the combination of the two chains can be employed as functional
sensing electrodes at the same time. The mature mass-fabrication technology of screen printing was successfully
introduced to print n-type and p-type thermoelectric inks atop a polymeric substrate to form thermocouples to
construct two independent chains, which makes this DC-ThEG flexible, high-performance and cost-efficient. The
emerging material of silk filbroin was employed to cover the gap of the fabricated two chains to serve as a functional
layer for sensing the existence of liquid water molecules in the air and the temperature. The powering and sensing
functions of the developed DC-ThEG and their interactions were systematically studied via experimental
measurements, which proved the DC-ThEG to be a robust multi-functional power source with a 151 mV open-circuit
voltage. In addition, it was successfully demonstrated that this DC-ThEG can convert heat energy to achieve a 3.3 V
output, matching common power demands of wearable electronics, and harvest biothermal energy to drive
commercial electronics (i.e., a calculator). The integration approach of powering and multi-functional sensing based on
this new double-chain configuration might open a new chapter in advanced thermoelectric generators, especially in
the applications of all-in-one self-powered microsystems.

 

Introduction

As an essential component of the Internet of Things
(IoT), wearable mobile electronics are widely used for
environmental sensing and human health monitoring by
detecting environmental variables and human physical
conditions, which has attracted widespread attention from
researchers and entrepreneurs’ °. However, the limited
battery life makes these electronics require frequent
recharging, which is a key issue for wearable electronic
devices. In recent years, several micro energy harvesting

techniques have been developed as candidates to power
wearable electronic devices to extend the battery life by
converting ambient micro energy into electricity: thermo-
electric generators (ThEGs) for thermal energy’ ’, tribo-
electric generators (TEGs)'°-'” and piezoelectric generators
(PEGs)'*-'° for mechanical energy, solar cells for solar
energy'°'”, etc.°-**. However, the output of TEGs and
PEGs is an alternating current (AC), and mechanical
movement is a necessary condition for them. Furthermore,
solar cells must work in the presence of light. In compar-
ison, the use of ThEGs is considered to be one of the most
promising approaches to power wearable electronic devices
due to the properties of continuous direct current (DC)
output and lack of the above restrictions”’~*°.

The working mechanism of a ThEG is based on the
Seebeck effect®’~°*, and an applied temperature difference
results in charge carriers in the thermoelectric material (i-e.,
electrons in n-type thermoelectric material and holes in
p-type thermoelectric material) diffusing from the hot side
to the cold side, therefore, a current is generated in the
circuit**~°°. In order for the ThEG to be a wearable power
source, high mechanical stability, electrical output stability,
and flexibility are required, therefore, conventional physical
cutting methods for bulk inorganic thermoelectric materials
are improper for wearable ThEGs due to the material
properties of rigidity and brittleness. Some organic’’ or
organic-based composite thermoelectric materials*® have
been proposed to make ThEGs capable to possess flexibility.
However, the low output performance of organic-based
flexible ThEGs resulting from the high contact resistance
has limited their application as a wearable power source. In
recent years, a low-cost and mass-fabrication industrial
technique called screen printing has been developed to
print Bi,Te,7Se9.3- and Sb,Te3-based thermoelectric inks
onto a flexible substrate to construct high-performance
flexible ThEGs*’~*’. Nevertheless, most of the reported
wearable ThEGs only serve as power sources for a sensor
network and are not sensors themselves. Therefore, for
ThEGs to make a real impact in wearable electronics, fur-
ther improvements in the integration of ThEGs and sensors
are needed.

In this work, to overcome the above issues, we propose
a wearable double-chain thermoelectric generator (DC-
ThEG) that simultaneously realizes the capabilities of
thermal energy harvesting and capacitance-based sensing.
The low-cost and mass-fabrication industrial technique of
screen printing was successfully introduced to print
BizTe2.7Se9.3 (n-type)- and Sb .Te3 (p-type)-based ther-
moelectric inks atop a flexible substrate of polyimide (PI)
film to form 10 pairs of thermocouples. By pre-patterning
a 150-mesh screen, the 10 pairs of thermocouples were
made into two individual thermoelectric leg chains, whose
gap was covered with silk fibroin to realize sensing
characteristics. An open-circuit voltage of ~151 mV and
remarkable mechanical stability and electrical output
stability were achieved in this work. Additionally, due to
the differential absorption behaviors of silk fibroin to
water in different state in the air (ie, gas and liquid
states), the proposed DC-ThEG was demonstrated to
possess the ability to detect the existence of liquid-state
water in the air. It is worth mentioning that gaseous-state
water in the air refers to water vapor, while liquid-state
water in the air refers to tiny droplets, which are sus-
pended in the air due to the balance of gravity and
buoyancy. Additionally, due to the linear relationship
between the dielectric constant of silk fibroin and tem-
perature, the proposed DC-ThEG has the potential to
serve as a temperature sensor. Moreover, in the case of

wearing, the characteristics of thermoelectricity genera-
tion, detecting the existence of liquid-state water in the air
and temperature detection can operate well under each
other’s working conditions, which was proven by com-
prehensive experimental comparisons. In addition, to
verify the feasibility of the DC-ThEG as a power source,
the DC-ThEG was connected to a series-parallel switch-
ing circuit to charge twenty-two 2200 uF capacitors to
realize a 3.3 V output, and through this method, the DC-
ThEG was successfully demonstrated to power a com-
mercial calculator by converting the surface heat of the
human body into electricity.

Methods
Preparation of the thermoelectric materials

As shown in Fig. la, the thermoelectric materials
include two types, n-type and p-type, which were pre-
pared by evenly mixing the paste synthesis with
BizTe27Se9.3 powder and Sb.Te3 powder, respectively.
The prepared paste synthesis contained the following
three components: 60.4 wt.% liquid epoxy resin, 38.6 wt.%
methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) and 1 wt.
% 2-ethyl-4-methyl-1H-imidazole-1-propanenitrile
(EMIP). The liquid epoxy resin was prepared by evenly
mixing polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PPGDGE)
and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BPFDGE) in a weight
ratio of 1:1, which served as the base solution of the paste
synthesis. Then, MHHPA was added to the obtained
liquid epoxy, acting as a hardener. Subsequently, EMIP, as
a catalyst to decrease the reaction temperature and
simultaneously increase the reaction velocity, was added
to the mixture solution of liquid epoxy resin and MHHPA
to obtain the paste synthesis, as shown in steps (i)—(iv).
Finally, Bi2Te27Se93 powder and Sb2Te3 powder were
added to the obtained paste synthesis in weight ratios of
1:5 and 1:6, respectively, to correspondingly form the n-
type Bi.Te27Sep3 ink and p-type Sb2Te3 ink, as shown in
steps (iv)—(v).

Preparation of silk fibroin solution

The preparation of silk fibroin solution can be sum-
marized into the following steps*”, as shown Fig. $1 in the
Supporting Information file. First, natural Bombyx mori
cocoons were boiled in 0.02M_ sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3) solution for 45 min to remove sericin. Thus,
extracted silk fibers were obtained. After being rinsed in
deionized (DI) water five times, the silk fibers were dried
at 45°C for 2h. Subsequently, the dried silk fibers were
completely dissolved by immersion in 9.3M _ lithium
bromide (LiBr) solution at 60°C for 4h. To obtain pure
silk fibroin solution, the mixed LiBr/silk solution was
dialyzed for 48h using a 3.5K MWCO dialysis film to
remove LiBr ions, and eventually, the silk fibroin solution
was further purified through 5 um _  microfiltration

Fig. 1 Process flowchart for the proposed wearable multi-functional double-chain thermoelectric generator (DC-ThEG), including the two
main steps of the preparation of thermoelectric inks and the printing of the double-chain configuration of the DC-ThEG. a Preparation of
n-type (BizTes7Se93) and p-type (Sb2Te3) thermoelectric materials in the form of inks: (i)-(iv) Using the weight ratio of 30.2%:30.2%:38.6%:1%, PPGDGE
(polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ether), BPFDGE (bisphenol F diglycidy! ether), MHHPA (methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride, hardener), and EMIP (2-
ethyl-4-methyl-1H-imidazole-1-propanenitrile, catalyst) were sequentially mixed to form the paste synthesis. (iv)-(v) BisTe>7Se93 powder and SbzTe3
powder were evenly mixed with the prepared paste synthesis in weight ratios of 1:5 and 1:6, respectively, to correspondingly form the n-type
thermoelectric ink and the p-type thermoelectric ink, respectively. b Printing of the proposed DC-ThEG: (i)—(iii) successive printing of the prepared n-
type (BisTe>7Se€o3) and p-type (Sb2Te3) thermoelectric materials on a polyimide (Pl) substrate to form complementary double-chain couples by using
a screen-printing process, and (iii)-(iv) dispensing of silk fibroin solution atop the gap of the two thermoelectric chains to form a thin silk fibroin layer.
It is worth mentioning that there are partially overlapping junctions of the two types of thermoelectric materials instead of traditional metal junctions
to ensure lower resistance and simultaneously reduce the structural complexity for better wearable integration

(Millipore Inc.) three times. It is worth mentioning that an
environment below 4 °C was applied during the storage of
the obtained silk fibroin solution to decline the gelation
effect.

Fabrication of the proposed DC-ThEG

As shown in Fig. 1b, the fabrication process flow for the
proposed DC-ThEG mainly includes four steps. First, a
50 um-thick polyimide (PI) film was cut into an area of
60mm x 35mm, serving as the substrate. Then, the

 

prepared two types of thermoelectric material were suc-
cessively printed on the PI substrate to form two chain
thermocouples by using screen-printing technology, as
shown in steps (i)—(ii)—(iii). Specifically, a pre-patterned
150-mesh screen was fixed over the PI substrate, and then,
the prepared BiyTe27Sep,3 ink (n-type) was dispensed and
evenly scraped by a scraper. Thus, the BiyTe27Se93 ink (n-
type) was deposited atop the PI substrate through the
threads crossing the holes to form n-type thermoelectric
legs. To prevent them from being destroyed by the second
Wen et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:68

screen-printing procedure, the printed n-type thermo-
electric legs were cured at 90°C for 30 min. Then, another
150-mesh screen pre-patterned with patterns com-
plementary to those of the previous screen was placed at the
same position over the PI substrate as in the last printing
procedure, and SbjTe; ink (p-type) was printed atop the PI
substrate by the same operations to form p-type thermo-
electric legs. Furthermore, a thermal annealing process at
380 °C for 4h was applied to the two printed thermoelectric
materials to recrystallize them, and a thermal annealing
process was performed in an oven filled with a N2 atmo-
sphere to prevent oxidation of the thermoelectric materials.
After annealing, a ThEG with double-chain thermocouples
was obtained. Note that the printed thermoelectric legs had
partially overlapping areas at the junctions of the two kinds
of thermoelectric materials in the long-axis direction, which
served to connect the two thermoelectric materials. Com-
pared with the traditional method using copper taps to
connect two different thermoelectric legs, partial over-
lapping printing can achieve a more effective connection
between the n-type thermoelectric legs and p-type ther-
moelectric legs; thus, a lower total resistance of the device
was obtained. Additionally, the partially overlapping struc-
tures enable lower device complexity for better wearable
integration. Finally, the functional sensing material of silk
fibroin solution was dropped onto the gap between the two
chains of thermoelectric legs and dried at 45°C for 30 min
to form a silk fibroin film to construct the proposed
DC-ThEG, as shown in steps (iii)—(iv).

Tests and measurements

The surface morphologies of the thermoelectric mate-
rials were characterized using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL Ltd.). A
heating plate was used to supply heat to test the ther-
moelectric characteristics of the proposed DC-ThEG. The
temperatures of the cold side and hot side were measured
using a thermometer (GM1312, Benetech Inc.). The
thermoelectric output voltages and resistances of the
device were measured by using a desktop digital multi-
meter (DM3068, RIGOL Technology Co., Ltd.). To obtain
a stable temperature difference (AT) for the measurement
of fabricated ThEGs, a natural cooling process was
designed by setting an initial temperature difference of
60 °C and then turning off the hot plate. Since this natural
cooling process is very slow and requires over one hour to
cool down to room temperature, at each desired point, AT
remains stable for a specific period long enough for the
electrical measurement. When AT decreased to the
desired values, the corresponding output voltages and
resistances were recorded, and the above process was
repeated three times to calculate the average values to
reduce the error. The charging process of capacitors was
characterized by a combination of a digital oscilloscope

Page 4 of 13

(DS2302A, RIGOL Technology Co., Ltd.) and an elec-
trometer (Keithley 6514, Tektronix Co., Ltd.). To test the
characteristic of detecting the existence of liquid-state
water in the air, a corresponding test system was estab-
lished. Specifically, two humidity controllers based on
different working principles were employed to supply
gaseous- and liquid-state water molecules to simulate air
environments with gas-state and liquid-state water,
respectively. An LCR meter (E4890A, KEYSIGHT Tech-
nology Co., Ltd.) was applied to measure the real-time
capacitance change of the DC-ThEG.

Results and discussion
Thermal energy harvesting
Performance measurement

As shown in Fig. 2a, the proposed DC-ThEG was
composed of three main components. First, a PI film was
prepared as the substrate, which allows the device to
possess good flexibility. Second, double-chain thermo-
couples made of BiyTe,7Se9.3 (n-type) and Sb Te; (p-
type) were printed atop the PI film by using a screen-
printing process, which serve as thermoelectric legs for
thermoelectricity generation and electrodes for multi-
functional sensing. Finally, a silk fibroin layer was
employed to cover the gap between the two separate
thermoelectric leg chains, working as a functional mate-
rial to detect the existence of liquid-state water in the air
and the temperature. Compared with single-chain ther-
moelectric legs, the structure of double-chain thermo-
electric legs allows more functional sensing based on the
capacitive effect to be realized (i.e., detecting the existence
of liquid-state water in the air and the temperature) while
ensuring the power density for thermoelectric generation
due to the unchanged number of thermoelectric legs.
Figure 2b shows a photograph of a fabricated DC-ThEG
with dimensions of 60 mm x 35 mm x 0.2 mm in a bend-
ing state, and the demonstrated flexibility reveals the
feasibility of the DC-ThEG being a wearable device. The
partially enlarged image of the device shown in Fig. 2c
shows that the thermocouples were well printed atop the
PI substrate. In addition, in this work, the gap between
any two adjacent thermoelectric legs, the width of all
thermoelectric legs and the length of all thermoelectric
legs of the fabricated device were 0.8mm, 1.5mm, and
22 mm, respectively. The resistance of two thermoelectric
leg chains in series (10 pairs of thermocouples for the
entire device) was 1.75kQ. The surface morphologies of
the two thermoelectric materials of the fabricated device
were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), as shown in Fig. 2d, e. The compactness and good
distribution of the surfaces reveal that the thermoelectric
legs were well screen printed atop the PI substrate. In
addition, the corresponding average thicknesses of the
screen-printed n-type (Bi,Te2.7Se9.3) and p-type (Sb2Tes3)

single-chain thermoelectric generators (ThEGs), this novel double-chain configuration endows ThEGs with the unique feature of simultaneously

covering the gap between them

thermoelectric legs were approximately 105um and
83 um, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2 in the Supporting
Information file.

To verify the feasibility of using the proposed DC-ThEG
as a wearable power source for thermal energy harvesting,
the comprehensive output performance of the fabricated
device was systematically investigated by a series of tests
and measurements. Figure 3a illustrates the schematic
diagram of the working mechanism based on the Seebeck
effect of the proposed DC-ThEG for thermal energy har-
vesting. When a AT is applied to the device, charge car-
riers (i.e., electrons in the n-type thermoelectric material of
BizTe27Se9,3 and holes in the p-type thermoelectric
material of SbyTe3) diffuse from the hot side to the cold
side, resulting in a potential being generated in the circuit,
which can be measured by a digital multimeter. Moreover,
a switch K, was used to alternate the working states of the
device (i., thermal energy harvesting and multi-
functional sensing), and a switch K> was used to alter-
nate the testing states of the measurement platform (i.e.,
open-circuit state and load-connected state).

The temperature difference is an essential parameter to
evaluate the performance of ThEGs, which is defined as
the temperature at the hot side minus that at the cold side
simultaneously measured by a thermometer. Figure 3b
shows the practical temperature rising trends of hot side
temperature 7, and cold side temperature T, when a

 

90°C heat source was applied to one side of the device.
The hot side temperature T; rose sharply from 25.2 °C
(room temperature) to 86.5 °C, while the cold side tem-
perature T> rose slightly from 25.2 °C to 36.5 °C. As shown
in Fig. 3c, when switch K; was turned on and switch K>
was turned off, the open-circuit output voltage of the
developed DC-ThEG was obtained, which increased lin-
early with increasing temperature difference AT applied to
the device (ie., the black curve). A high open-circuit
output voltage of ~151 mV and an output power of 13 pW
(i.e., the red curve) were achieved when the AT of the
device was 50 °C. Figure 3d shows the output performance
of the proposed DC-ThEG for external loads with various
resistances from 0.1 kOQ to 30 kO at different temperature
differences when switches K; and Ky were turned on. We
can observe the following two aspects: First, when the
value of the load resistor was constant, the output power
to the corresponding load resistor increased with
increasing temperature difference of the device. Second,
when the temperature difference of the device was con-
stant, the output power to the resistors first showed a
rising trend as the resistance of the external load resistors
increased from 0.1kQ to 1.8kQ and then showed a
declining trend as the resistance of the external load
resistors increased from 1.8 kQ to 30 kQ. In other words,
when the fabricated device worked as a thermal energy
harvester, its matched load was ~1.8 kQ.. In this work, the

electrons in n-type thermoelectric material, BizTe>7Se93, and holes in p-type thermoelectric material, Sb>Te3) diffuse from the hot side to the cold
side, resulting in a current, which can be measured by a digital multimeter connected to the two thermoelectric leg chains. Two switches K; and kK

resistors at different AT (load-connected state: K;-ON, K>-ON). The maximum value of ~2.9 UW was achieved when AT and the load resistance were

50°C and 1.8 kQ, respectively

maximum output power of the fabricated DC-ThEG to
external resistors reached ~2.9 u.W when the AT of the
device was 50°C and the load resistor had a matched
resistance of 1.8kQ. In addition, taking the total area of
the thermoelectric legs and junctions into account (i.e.,
8.43cm’), the corresponding maximum load output
power density was 3.44uW/m7?. It is worth mentioning
that due to the continuous direct current output property
of ThEGs, the fabricated device has the potential to
quickly charge capacitors to power wearable electronics,
which is demonstrated in the section “The charging
property of the DC-ThEG’”.

Reliability and repeatability measurement
For wearable energy harvesting devices, remarkable
mechanical reliability, and output repeatability are

 

required. Therefore, a series of reliability and repeatability
tests were carried out to systematically evaluate the
wearability of the proposed DC-ThEG, as shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 4a exhibits the resistance change ratios of a fabri-
cated DC-ThEG in the bending state for various radii
from 5cm to 1.5cm in both the long-axis (A—A’) and
short axis (B—B’) directions. The change ratio of the
resistance is defined as (R — Ro)/Ro, where Ro refers to the
initial total resistance of the 10 pairs of thermocouples
and R refers to the real-time resistance tested under
special operation. The inset of Fig. 4a shows an illustra-
tion of the various bending radii. When the fabricated
DC-ThEG was bent along the long-axis (A—A’) and short
axis (B—B’) to a radius of 3.cm, the corresponding resis-
tance change ratios of the 10 pairs of thermocouples were
1.69% and 1.38%, respectively. In other words, the

and output voltages (AT = 50°C) of the developed DC-ThEG at different bending cycles in both the A-A’ and B-B’ directions, which were remarkably
stable even after 1000 bending cycles. ¢ Similar to other traditional ThEGs, the resistance of this DC-ThEG increases as the temperature increases, but
it is worth mentioning that the increase is linear and stays at a relatively low level with a less than 1% increase per 6 °C. d The repeatability of the
developed DC-ThEG was tested by 100-cycle heating, which revealed that its resistance and output performance remained steady. In brief, as one of
most important factors of sustainable power sources for wearable electronics applications, the reliability and repeatability of the proposed DC-ThEG

were proven

 

fabricated device can be bent to a radius of 3cm in both
directions while the total resistance remains almost con-
stant. Figure 4(b) shows the resistance change ratios and
output performance of the fabricated DC-ThEG after
enduring different bending cycles to a radius of 3cm.
After 1000 bending cycles to a radius of 3 cm in the long-
axis direction (A—A’) and the short axis direction, the
corresponding change ratios of the resistance of the
device were 4.41% and 4.46%, respectively, while the
output voltages of the device at AT =50°C remained
almost consistent with the original value. The inset of
Fig. 4b exhibits a bending illustration of the device
marked with the bending directions. As shown in Fig. 4c,
the resistance of the two chains slightly increased with
increasing temperature, resulting from the enhancement
of the phonon scattering of charge carriers reducing the
mobility of charge carriers****. The resistance change was

approximately linear, with a low rate of a less than 1%
increase per 6°C. In addition, the repeatability of the
proposed DC-ThEG was studied by a 100-cycle heating
experiment, as shown in Fig. 4d. After 100-cycle heating,
both the total resistance of the 10 pairs of thermocouples
(returned to room temperature) and the output voltage of
the device (AT = 50°C) remained highly consistent with
the corresponding original values. In summary, the above
analysis reveals the remarkable mechanical reliability and
output repeatability of the developed DC-ThEG, which
make it meet the requirements for being a reliable power
source of wearable electronic devices.

Multi-functional sensing

To improve the integration and functionality of wear-
able ThEGs, we developed a novel structure of double-
chain thermoelectric legs, as shown in Fig. 2a, which
Wen et al. Microsystems & Nanoengineering (2020)6:68

makes the ThEG feasible as a capacitance-based sensor
while ensuring the generated electricity density. In this
work, we used silk fibroin to cover the gap between the
two thermoelectric leg chains to serve as the functional
component for detecting the existence of liquid-state
water in the air and the temperature.

In fact, two-state water (ie., gas and liquid states) can
coexist in the air. The gaseous-state water in the air is
water vapor, while the liquid-state water in the air refers
to suspended tiny droplets that have a balance between
gravity and buoyancy, ie., fog. Conventional humidity
sensors can react to both liquid- and gaseous-state water
in the air; therefore, it is very difficult for conventional
humidity sensors to judge whether liquid-state water
molecules exist in the air. Due to the differential
absorption behaviors of silk fibroin for different-state
water in the air (ie., gas and liquid states), the proposed
DC-ThEG was demonstrated to be a sensor for detecting
the existence of liquid-state water in the air.

The working mechanism and measurement of the
proposed DC-ThEG for the detection of liquid-state water
in the air are exhibited in Fig. 5a—c. When the silk fibroin
between the two thermoelectric leg chains absorbs water
molecules, its dielectric constant increases, resulting in an
increase in the capacitance of the DC-ThEG. In contrast,
the dielectric constant of the silk fibroin declines when the
silk fibroin desorbs water molecules, leading to a decrease
in the capacitance of the DC-ThEG. The above working
mechanism combined with the differential absorption
behaviors of silk fibroin for different-state water in the air
(i.e., gas and liquid states) allows the developed DC-ThEG
to detect the existence of liquid-state water in the air. In
the experiment, a test setup was built to verify this
characteristic of the fabricated device, as shown in Fig. 5a.
Two humidity controllers based on different working
principles were separately used to supply gaseous- and
liquid-state water molecules to simulate the correspond-
ing air conditions, and an LCR meter was applied to trace
the real-time capacitance change of the proposed DC-
ThEG.

When switches K, and Ky were turned off, the DC-
ThEG worked in a capacitance-based sensing mode, as
shown in the circuit diagram in the inset of Fig. 5b. The
experimental results shown in Fig. 5b exactly validate the
differential absorption behaviors of silk fibroin for the
two-state water in the air. In the experiment, from 0s to
10 s, two-state water were separately applied to the device
to observe the capacitance changes in the corresponding
absorption processes. At 10s, the supply of water applied
was stopped, and the device was removed to normal air
conditions to investigate the desorption processes. When
the two-state water were separately applied to the DC-
ThEG, apparently different capacitance response beha-
viors of the fabricated device were observed. The

capacitance response of the device to gaseous-state water
in the air, shown as the red curve in Fig. 5b, remained
almost constant in both the absorption and desorption
processes. From the enlarged capacitance response
waveform shown in Fig. 5c, only ~0.2 pF normal fluc-
tuations were observed before and after the tenth second,
revealing no reaction of the fabricated device to gaseous-
state water in the air. In contrast, the fabricated DC-ThEG
exhibited an intense capacitance increase in response to
liquid-state water, as shown by the black curve in Fig. 5b.
The capacitance of the DC-ThEG rapidly increased from
the initial value of ~15.9 pF to ~100.1 pF within 10 s after
the liquid-state water supplied by the humidity controller
was applied to it. When the supply of liquid-state water
was stopped and the device was removed to normal air
conditions, the capacitance of the DC-ThEG rapidly
dropped to 25pF within 2s due to the large water
molecule concentration difference between the device and
air environment and then recovered to the initial value
~8 s later. Therefore, the developed DC-ThEG was proven
to possess the ability to detect the existence of liquid-state
water in the air based on a combination of Fig. 5a—c and
the above analysis. This feature also has good repeat-
ability, which can be proven by combining Figs. S3, S4,
and the corresponding analysis in the Supporting
Information file.

In addition, a change in temperature usually causes a
change in the dielectric constant of a dielectric material,
ie., an increase or a decrease, which may be linear or
nonlinear. An increase in temperature will intensify the
molecular motion of silk fibroin, leading to an increase in
the dielectric constant of silk fibroin*”. In this work, we
also studied the impact of temperature on the dielectric
constant of the silk fibroin we prepared by observing the
change in the capacitance of the device with temperature.
As a result, a linear relationship between the capacitance
of the DC-ThEG and temperature was observed, as shown
in Fig. 5d, which provides powerful evidence demon-
strating the feasibility of the developed DC-ThEG func-
tioning as a temperature sensor.

Interaction between thermal energy harvesting and
functional sensing

In this work, thermal energy harvesting based on the
thermoelectric effect (i.e., the Seebeck effect) and multi-
functional sensing based on the capacitive effect were
integrated in a single device; however, these character-
istics might interact due to the differences between their
working conditions, ie., a temperature difference for
power generation and moist air for functional sensing.
Therefore, to systematically investigate the interaction
between these characteristics, a series of experimental
comparisons were carried out, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

Fig. 5 Functional sensing mechanism and measurement of the developed DC-ThEG. a When the silk fibroin between the two thermoelectric
leg chains absorbs water molecules, its dielectric constant increases, resulting in an increase in the capacitance of the DC-ThEG. In contrast, the
desorption of water molecules from the silk fibroin leads to a decrease in the capacitance of the device. A test setup was built to analyse the
absorption behaviors of the fabricated device for water molecules in two different states; this setup consists of two humidity controllers to supply
liquid- and gaseous-state water, respectively, and an LCR meter to trace the capacitance change in real time. b Absorption behaviors of silk fibroin for
different-state water in the air (i.e, gas and liquid states). In this function, both switches K; and K> were turned off, as shown in the circuit diagram in
the inset. The fabricated device exhibited a dramatic capacitance increase from 15.9 pF to 100.1 pF when liquid water molecules were applied for 10 s
(black). After the removal of liquid water molecules at 10s, the capacitance sharply declined. In contrast, the capacitance of the fabricated device
exhibited no change (red) after gaseous water molecules were applied for 10s, except for only normal fluctuations, as shown in (¢). d A good linear
relationship between the capacitance and temperature was observed, which provides reasonable evidence verifying the feasibility of using the
developed DC-ThEG for temperature sensing

 

output performance of the proposed DC-ThEG was stu-
died by testing the same device before and after covering
the gap between the two thermoelectric leg chains with
silk fibroin, as shown in Fig. 6a. The open-circuit voltage
of the device after covering the gap with silk fibroin film
showed a slight decay only in cases of large temperature
differences, such as AT > 25°C. In other words, in the case
of wearing, the silk fibroin cover had almost no effect on
the thermoelectric performance of the device. Moreover,
we placed the device in an atmospheric environment, a

gaseous-state water molecule-filled environment and a
liquid-state water molecule-filled environment and tested
the corresponding output voltages to investigate the effect
of the two-state water molecules on the output perfor-
mance of the device. As shown in Fig. 6b, regardless of
whether the fabricated DC-ThEG worked in the gaseous-
state water molecule-filled environment or the liquid-
state water molecule-filled environment, a_ negligible
decay in the open-circuit voltage of the device was
observed only in cases of large temperature differences,

Fig. 6 Investigation of the effect of the integration of functional sensing on the thermoelectric output performance of the proposed DC-
ThEG. a Comparison of the output performances of the device before and after covering the gap between the two thermoelectric leg chains with
silk fibroin. A slight decrease in the open-circuit voltage of the device occurred after covering the gap with silk fibroin only in cases of large

temperature differences (i.e, AT > 25 °C). b Comparison of the output performances of the device in an atmospheric environment, a gaseous-state

 

 

water molecule-filled environment, and a liquid-state water molecule-filled environment. In the three environments, the open-circuit voltages of the

 

 

device had slight differences only in cases of large temperature differences (i.e, AT > 30 °C). Therefore, in the case of wearing, the proposed DC-ThEG

possesses good stability to different-state water molecules

such as AT’> 30°C, indicating the stability of the devel-
oped DC-ThEG to moisture in thermal power generation,
especially in the case of wearing.

In addition, the impact of temperature on functional
sensing was studied by observing the capacitance response
behaviors of the DC-ThEG for supplied liquid-state water
molecules at different device temperatures, as shown in Fig.
7. From the capacitance response waveforms shown in Fig.
7a, the response of the proposed DC-ThEG to supplied
liquid-state water molecules gradually weakened as the
device temperature increased. When the temperature of the
device reached 40°C, the corresponding capacitance
response only showed a slight increase from 20.4 pF to
21.6 pF within 10s after the liquid-state water supplied by
the humidity controller was applied to the device, and the
capacitance of the device remained almost consistent when
the device temperature reached 45°C, which can be
observed in the enlarged capacitance response waveforms
shown in Fig. 7b, c, respectively. Therefore, the character-
istic of the fabricated DC-ThEG of detecting the existence
of liquid-state water in the air was susceptible to tempera-
ture. Fortunately, the surface temperature of human skin
and ambient temperature are usually not higher than 40 °C;
therefore, in wearing conditions, the developed DC-ThEG
possesses a sensitive capacitive response to liquid-state
water in the air, enabling it to serve as a detector of liquid-
state water in the air.

It is worth mentioning that both thermal energy har-
vesting and temperature sensing are based on changes in
temperature; therefore, there is no mutual influence
between them. In other words, the thermal power

 

generation and sensing functions of liquid-state water
detection and temperature detection can coexist under
each other’s working conditions in the case of wearing.

The charging property of the DC-ThEG

As a green energy technology, ThEGs are expected to be
applied to convert industrial waste heat and human body
heat into electrical energy; thus, they are considered a
solution for the energy crisis and energy pollution. One of
the main parameters for evaluating the performance of a
ThEG is the charging capability. In this work, for two
application scenarios of high-temperature environments
and wearing conditions, we tested the charging property
of the proposed DC-ThEG, as shown in Fig. 8. For high-
temperature environments, we took AT=50°C as an
example and tested the charging capability of the pro-
posed DC-ThEG by charging a 2200 uF capacitor and
twenty-two parallel 2200 uF capacitors. As shown in Fig.
8a, the charging times for the capacitor and twenty-two
parallel capacitors to be charged from 0 to ~150 mV were
19.6 s and 369.0 s, respectively. It is worth mentioning that
the twenty-two 2200 uF capacitors were connected to a
series-parallel switching circuit and then to the DC-
ThEG. The circuit diagram of the series-parallel switching
circuit is shown in Fig. $5 in the Supporting Information
file. After the twenty-two parallel capacitors were charged
to 150 mV, we turned off the parallel switches and turned
on the series switches; thus, a 3.3 V output was achieved,
as shown in the inset of Fig. 8a. This 3.3 V output can
power most commercial electronic devices, revealing the
potential practicability of the proposed DC-ThEG. In

Fig. 7 Investigation of the effect of the temperature applied for thermoelectric generation on the functional sensing of detecting the

existence of liquid-state water molecules in the air. a Response behaviors of the developed DC-ThEG to supplied liquid-state water molecules at
different temperatures. From (i) to (v), the DC-ThEG exhibited an apparently weakened capacitance response as the temperature increased. At 40 °C,
only a slight capacitance change was observed in b the enlarged image of the capacitive response behavior, and at 45 °C, the developed DC-ThEG
exhibited no obvious capacitance change except for normal fluctuations in response to liquid-state water molecules, which can be viewed in ¢ the

enlarged view of the capacitance response waveform

addition, to further evaluate the charging capability of the
DC-ThEG, several other capacitors with different capa-
citance values were selected to be charged with the DC-
ThEG, i.e., 100 uF, 220 uF, 470 uF, and 1000 uF, as shown
in Fig. S6 in the Supporting Information file. It took only
11.9s for twenty-two parallel 100 uF capacitors to be
charged from 0 to 150 mV, verifying the excellent char-
ging capability of the proposed DC-ThEG. Furthermore,
to indicate the real impact on the sustainable wearable
energy supply, 4 DC-ThEGs were connected in series and
worn on a human arm to convert human body heat into
electricity to charge twenty-two parallel 1000 uF capaci-
tors, as shown in Fig. 8b, c. It took 860.5s to charge the
twenty-two parallel 1000 uF capacitors to 55mV, as
shown in Fig. 8d, and a more than 1.2 V output was
obtained by the series-parallel switching circuit, which
can power some _ low-power-consumption electronic
devices, such as the commercial calculator shown in Fig.
8e. The corresponding processes of charging the

 

 

capacitors and powering the calculator are exhibited in
Supplementary Video S1. It is worth mentioning that high
silica cloth with a thickness of 1mm was attached to one
side of the devices, serving as a heat insulation layer to
ensure a temperature difference. In summary, the above
experimental results combined with the results shown in
Fig. 5 indicate that the proposed DC-ThEG will have a
wide range of applications in the foreseeable future.

Conclusions

In this work, a wearable double-chain thermoelectric
generator (DC-ThEG) was developed to achieve the inte-
gration of thermal energy harvesting and capacitance-based
multi-functional sensing. The proposed DC-ThEG was
fabricated by using a screen-printing process to print
BiyTe27Se93 (n-type)- and SbzTe3 (p-type)-based thermo-
electric inks atop a PI substrate to form double-chain
thermocouples and by filling the gap between the two
chains with silk fibroin to form a functional sensing layer.

Fig. 8 The proposed DC-ThEG was demonstrated to possess an excellent charging capability and to successfully power portable
electronics. a The times for charging a 2200 uF capacitor and twenty-two parallel 2200 uF capacitors from 0 to 150 mV were 19.6s and 369.0s,
respectively. (inset) Through a series-parallel switching circuit, a 3.3 V output was obtained, which is commonly used to drive low-power-
consumption electronic devices, such as wearable electronics. b-e Fabricated DC-ThEGs were worn on an arm to harvest human body heat to
charge twenty-two parallel 1000 UF capacitors to 55 mV in 860.5 s, and subsequently, a commercial calculator was successfully driven

As a result, the DC-ThEG demonstrated an output cap-
ability of 151 mV (AT=50°C), and remarkable electrical
output stability and mechanical stability were experimen-
tally confirmed at the same time. Furthermore, the cap-
abilities to detect the existence of liquid-state water in the
air and the temperature were successfully verified. The
above functions were experimentally proven to coexist in
the case of wearing. As an attractive application example, a
3.3 V output was achieved by harvesting thermal energy,
which meets the energy supply requirements of most
wearable electronics. Moreover, by harvesting human body
heat with DC-ThEGs and storing the converted electricity
in capacitors, a commercial calculator was successfully
driven. In summary, the integration of energy harvesting
and multi-functional sensing achieved in this work reveals
wide application prospects for the proposed DC-ThEG.
