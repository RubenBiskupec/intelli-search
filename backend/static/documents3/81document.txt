The present study aims to address the instability mode of the concrete spherical joint in order to guarantee the
safety of the rotating process of the swing bridge. A new critical overturning moment model is proposed to
calculate the overturning moment of swing bridge based on the non-Hertz contact theory, and it is validated
against the engineering application of the Nandu River Swing Bridge construction. The research indicates that
the Non-Hertz contact theory has superiority compared to the widely applied simplified formulation on the
spherical joint surface stress calculation, by contrasting the results of the finite element model and the data
collected during field monitoring. Furthermore, the resistance of the overturning coefficient is calculated, and
the result turns out that the critical resistance of the overturning coefficient based on the Non-Hertz contact
theory is closer to the measured values compared to the simplified algorithm. The present research demonstrates
the applicability of applying the new proposed formula to guarantee the safety of the rotating process during the

swing bridge construction.

 

1. Introduction

Rotating method | 1-4] is an innovative bridge construction method
that gains increasing popularity in recent years. The bridge that is under
construction is separated into two rotating systems, which are built on
each side of the surrounding terrain respectively and then rotated to the
bridge axis to butt at the proper time (Fig. 1). The swing bridge con-
struction method not only can enforce a strong spanning ability but also
can make full use of the surrounding terrain to build the main structure,
by which the construction of a large number of brackets in rivers and
valleys can be avoided. So the rotating construction method is particu-
larly applicable in mountainous areas, traffic inconvenience, construc-
tion site constraints, etc. [5,6]. During the bridge rotating process
(Fig. 2), the two bridge sections form an integral system with a spherical
joint bearing the weight of the whole bridge (Fig. 3). Therefore, the
swing process is the most critical stage in the entire bridge construction,
and the rotating system may overturn when the system resistance of
overturning ability is not sufficient [7].

During the design stage of the bridge, the resistance of the over-
turning moment must be calculated, in order to avoid the structural

overturn and collapse in the rotating process [8]. In addition, the slight
tilt of the rotating system must be controlled [9-11]. The contact stress
distribution of the spherical joint is the key parameter to calculate the
fractional moment of the spherical joint, and the resistance of the
overturning moment is provided by the fractional moment. Thus, ac-
curate prediction of contact stress and resistance of overturning moment
are both critical issues in the rotating process concerning the construc-
tion safety of the swing bridge. Fuchs | 12] and Patsch et al. [13] studied
designing and constructing process of swing bridge, but the monitoring
process was not addressed. Shi et al. [14] carried out a case study about
the overturning moment of the bridge under heavy vehicles, and they
proposed that the second-order effects due to girder rotation should be
considered when calculating the resistance of overturning moment.
Mohsen [15] investigated the overturning moment caused by tsunami
loads, and a new design protocol was proposed to compute the
maximum horizontal force, vertical force and overturning moment. Cai
[16] developed a two-dimensional (2D) fluid-structure interaction (FSI
model and validated it using experimental data and the significance of
the negative overturning moment was revealed. These researches show
the significance of the overturning moment of the bridge caused by

external effect, but few studies concerned about the overturning
moment in the rotating process of the swing bridge. Che [17] studied the
overturning moment problem of swing bridge during the construction
process, and a vertical compressive stress formula on the contact surface
of spherical joints was deduced by using the boundary action concen-
tration theory of half-space body, and then a formula of the critical
overturning moment was derived. But the formula was based on an
approximate calculating principle, which easily resulted in the over-
estimation of the critical overturning moment. Thus the calculated result
of resistance of the overturning coefficient used to estimate the resis-
tance of overturning ability would be higher than the actual value,
which potentially may result in the collapse of the bridge during the
rotating process [18].

During the rotating process, the overturning resistance of the bridge
is provided by the frictional resistance of the spherical joint. Therefore,
accurate prediction of the contact stress distribution on the surface of
the spherical joint can accurately predict the frictional resistance of the
spherical joint. Spherical joint surface contact problem was originated
from Hertz’s research about contact with elastic solids [19]. He found
that the contact area of two in-conformal contact elastic surfaces was
ellipsed and named the elliptical major semi-axis ‘a’ as contact band-
width, which was used to describe the magnitude of the contact area.
Thus, the analytical solution of two in-conformal contact elastic surfaces
under normal pressure is obtained, but the Hertz contact theory is
limited to the case where the contact surfaces are very small. In the

1188

Chinese bridge monitoring standard [20] and American standard [21],
the contact stress of spherical joint of swing bridges can be simplified
directly as plane elastic rigid head, which can greatly simplify the
calculation of contact stress of spherical joint, but the distribution of
contact stress of spherical joint cannot be accurately predicted by this
simplified algorithm. Steuermann [22] put forward a theory, named
Non-Hertz contact theory, to solve the conformal contact of cylinders,
and he concluded that the shape of contact objects could be described as
a high degree polynomial and n is the polynomial index, while Hertz
contact theory is the specific case of n = 1. On the basis of Steuermann’s
research, Persson [23] proposed a similar conformal contact formula to
solve the spherical plane, but this formula is only applicable to the stress
calculation of infinite plane plate and is not applicable to the concrete
spherical joint of the swing bridge. Goodman and Keer [24] proposed a
new solution to the spherical surface contact, which excludes the basic
assumption of an elastic half-space body, but limits the Poisson’s ratio to
0.25 to reduce the computational complexity. Fang et al. [25,26] also
proposed a new spherical conformal contact formula, but the n value
[22] of the formula about Hertz contact is obtained by curve fitting,
which results in unstable calculation results. The finite element model
(FEM) method was widely used in the simulation of the spherical joint
[27], but the simulating process was not convenient to be used in the
construction site. Recently developed formulas based on the Non-Hertz
contact theory will be more suitable for spherical conformal contact
[28], which can better reflect the distribution of contact stress on the
surface of the spherical joint. They have greater accuracy than the
method of simplifying the spherical joint directly into the plane for
calculating the contact stress. However, in practical application, it is
necessary to adjust the contact bandwidth ‘a’ [19] according to the
actual situation.

The present study aims to provide a more accurate approach for the
calculation of contact stresses and enhance the safety of the rotating
process during the swing bridge construction. To characterize the dis-
tribution of spherical joints precisely, the Non-Hertz contact theory is
firstly used to calculate the spherical conformal contact stress on the
surface of spherical joints. The results of contact stress distribution are
compared with the simplified algorithm and the finite element model
results, which turn out that the Non-Hertz contact theory is more ac-
curate than the simplified algorithm. Then a new critical overturning
moment formula of bridge based on Non-Hertz contact theory is pro-
posed, and results show that the critical resistance of overturning coef-
ficient of bridge calculated from the new formula is closer to the on-site
measurement that contributes to improved safety in terms of the over-
turning moment, preventing overestimation of overturning resistance
ability. In the Supplementary material, the stress distributions and
proposed formula for overturning moment calculation are also verified
by literature case study [29].

2. Spherical joint instability and overturning resistance system
2.1. Spherical joint instability

The problem of spherical joint instability was investigated in many
fields [30]. There are two types of instability in the course of bridge

rotation [31] (Fig. 4).

(1) Spherical joint instability: Before the supporting foot has landed,
the entire bridge body will rotate around the spherical joint

(2) Supporting foot fulcrum instability: Supporting foot lands on the
slideway, the entire bridge overturns around the foot fulcrum.

The rotating process should ensure that the supporting foot does not
fall onto the slideway, because the friction between the supporting foot
and slideway is too large, and is not conducive to the smooth rotation of
the bridge [32]. Moreover, the calculation of the supporting foot
fulcrum instability is relatively simple. Therefore, the spherical joint
instability condition is only considered in this study.

2.2. Resistance system of overturning moment

When the center of gravity of the rotating system is not at the center
of the spherical-joint grinding center, the eccentric distance of the
rotating system causes the overturning moment of the whole rotating
system. Since the rotating process is the most critical and dangerous
construction stage in the construction of the rotating bridge, the incli-
nation of the whole rotating system should be monitored in real time
during the rotating process. The change of elevation angle can be used to
indicate the change of the overturning moment of the rotating system.
The relationship between the overturning moment and the inclination of
the back wall is shown in Fig. 5.

The calculation formula of the overturning moment and back wall
inclination angle is:

M, = Ge (1)

(2)

In which: M; is overturning moment. Mp is the resistance of over-
turning moment, namely, friction moment of spherical joint. e is the
eccentric distance. F, is the Supporting force. G is the mass of back wall. |
is the gravity center height of rotating system. 6 is the inclination of the
back wall.

The overturning resistance system of the swing bridge is composed of
an annular slideway, several supporting feet, and a locating pin, as
shown in Fig. 6. When the supporting foot of the rotating bridge does not
touch the ground, the overturning resistance moment is provided by the
friction moment of the spherical joint; when the supporting foot touches
the ground, the overturning resistance ability of the rotating system
reaches the maximum, and the supporting foot is the last barrier of the
overturning resistance system.

3. Algorithms for the calculation of contact stress
3.1. Simplified algorithm of spherical-joint stress

In the Chinese bridge monitoring standard [20], the contact surface
of the spherical joint is simplified as a plane contact calculation model,
and the stress of spherical joint is simplified as a plane uniformly
distributed force, which is used to calculate the contact stress of two
elastic infinite half-space bodies when they contact each other on two
surfaces.

The stress distribution on the contact surface can be described as a
simplified algorithm for spherical joint stress p:

_ F
ER?

p (3)

In which: p is the maximum average contact stress. F is the total load.
R is the horizontal radius of the spherical joint.

In the American standard [21], the stress distribution p of the
spherical joint on the contact surface is described as:

F

~ OR? (4)

Pp

In which: © is the resistance factor, there is very little experimental
evidence to precisely define ® for each limit state. ® is often taken to be
equal to 1.0 in many situations.

Thus, Eq. (3) is equal to Eq. (4), in other words, the stress of the
spherical joint is simplified as a plane to conveniently calculate the
contact stress in the actual construction process. The stress p is the
maximum average contact stress, so the calculation result is conserva-
tive, therefore it may lead to the computation deviation of the fraction
moment.

3.2. Non-Hertz contact theory

Non-Hertz contact theory is named relative to Hertz theory. It deals
with the contact stress problem depending on the load contact area. The
Non-Hertz contact theory calculation model is suitable for conformal
contact, which means the curvature center of two contact bodies is on
the same side of the contact surface, and its curvature radius is closed.

The conforming surface contact shape cannot be expressed
completely by quadratic polynomial [19], but by the following formula,
the initial clearance of the axisymmetric structure is S = A,x? +A x* +
vee $ Anx2t foes

The calculation can be carried out by only taking the first 2 items and
ignoring the other items, without affecting the precision of the results
[28].

S = Ayx + Aox* (5)

In Eq. (5),A, and A» are quadratic parabolic coefficients. For two-
dimensional axisymmetric shapes in the form of A,x?" the total load
function and its pressure distribution curve are obtained [22]:

usingn = 2 into Eqs. (6) and (7).

3.3. Finite element model

The 3D model of the concrete spherical joint is established by using
the ABAQUS finite element model, which is an important method to
calculate the contact force [33-35]. The length unit of the model is mm,
the corresponding unit of force is N, and the unit of stress is MPa. As
shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the upper spherical joint is a concave sphere with
a missing surface corresponding to the lower spherical joint. The lower
spherical joint, the upper spherical joint, and the locating pin are
assembled. The model has 10,000 C3D8I entity units in total.

The total load applied to the model is 59600 KN, and the radius of the
upper spherical joint is 1300 mm, thus uniformly distributed stress on

a

the top surface of the upper spherical joint is 11.23 N/mm/*. In order to
make the convergence of the simulating model, 10KN force is applied on
the surface of the upper spherical joint, eliminating the calculation er-
rors by the initial clearance between the upper and lower spherical joints
[33].

The internal contact is modeled as a deformable/deformable contact
[36], assuming that both spherical joints (C45 cement) have equal
elastic properties, with a Young modulus of 3.35 x 10° Pa anda Poisson
ratio of 0.2. Concerning boundary conditions (BC), the displacement and
rotation constraints are applied at the bottom surface of the lower
spherical joint boundary. During the load application process, no dam-
age will happen on the BC.

4. Comparative analysis of contact stress
4.1. Engineering background

The construction of the Nandu River Swing Bridge (190-meter main
span) in Hubei province, China is studied in this research. The stress of
the spherical joint of the swing bridge is calculated by the simplified
algorithm, Non-Hertz contact theory, and finite element simulation
model, respectively.

The size of the spherical joint part (unit: mm) is shown in Fig. 9.

4.2. Results analysis

When calculating the stress distribution of the spherical joint with
Eq. (10), it is necessary to convert the load into the radial load of the
spherical joint in a two-dimensional direction because it is a two-
dimensional stress distribution formula, the two-dimensional Fp: of the
axisymmetric load is calculated, as shown in Fig. 11:

(11), and the contact bandwidth is a = 1373.58 mm, however the
Horizontal radius is 1300 mm, so a = 1300 mm.

The 3D model of the concrete spherical joint is established by using
the ABAQUS finite element model. Before rotation, the spherical joint is
static. If the center of gravity of the swing bridge is on the axis of the

center of the spherical joint, the total weight of the rotating body is
applied to the contact stress of the spherical joint, as shown in Fig. 12.

Vibrating wire stress sensors (downward lower spherical joint, red
fork for the sensor) are installed in the concrete spherical joint of the
Nandu River Swing Bridge to measure the contact stress of the spherical
joint. The sensor arrangement is shown in Fig. 13.

In order to analyze the stress distribution at different distances from
the spherical joint center, the results of all the algorithms and the
measured data are statistically analyzed in Fig. 14.

The results of the contact stress on the surface of the spherical joint
are shown in Table 2 (from sensors 1 to 5). The deviation in the table
refers to the deviation with the observed data.

The following findings can be drawn from Fig. 14 and Table 2:

(1) Overall deviation analysis: The deviations of various algorithms
relative to the actual stress magnitude are in general more than
12%.

Respective deviation analysis: The deviation of the simplified

algorithm is 17.7% except the No. 4 measurement sensor, and the

deviation of other sensors is more than 40%. Especially the No. 3

measurement sensor is up to 212.8%. That is to say, the deviation

of the simplified algorithm is too high for stress calculation and
the stress prediction is too conservative.

The deviation of the FEM simulation calculation is above 20%
except for the No. 3 and 4 measurement sensors, and the devia-
tion of other sensors is more than 40%.

The deviation of the Non-Hertz contact theory calculation
method is 152.6% at the center of spherical, and the deviation of
stress prediction in another position is less than 22.3%.

(3) Although the physical boundary analysis of the Non-Hertz con-
tact theory is not very close to the FEM and actual situation, the
results turn out that it has a smaller deviation than the simplified
algorithm in the physical boundary.

(2)

From the above comparisons, the deviation of the Non-Hertz contact
theory calculation results is less than that of the simplified algorithm,

On the micro-plane A, the micro frictional resistance f; can be

5.2. Inclination analysis of back wall

The inclination tracking system is arranged on the spot for the
rotating system of Nandu River Swing Bridge to track the change of the
inclination angle of the back wall in the rotating process and to judge the
change of the overturning moment of the rotating system in real time.
When the inclination angle of the rotating system is too large, the
inclination angle of the rotating system can be corrected in real time to
ensure the safety, stability, and smoothness of the rotating system. The
parameters of the rotating system are shown in Table 3.

Spherical joint R = 8500 mm, contact bandwidth a = 1300 mm, the
upper and lower limit of 0 is a = Arcsin(50/8500), 7 = Arcsin(1300/
8500). Substituting all parameters in Eq. (17) and using Mathematica
software yields the resistance of overturning moment Mpon-nHertz =
4499.79KN-m. Substituting all parameters in Eq. (18) yields the resis-
tance of overturning momentMsimpltified = 6327.84 KN-m.

The inclination angle of the back wall is measured, and the over-
turning moment of the back wall in the direction of X (along the bridge)
and Y (across the bridge) can be calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2). The
results are shown in Fig. 16:

From Fig. 16, at the 480 min. of rotating process, the maximum
inclination angle appeared. Eqs. (1) and (2) are used to calculate the
maximum overturning moment yielding the maximum value of

From the calculation results of the resistance of the overturning co-
efficient, it can be seen that the resistance of overturning coefficient
based on the simplified algorithm is 40.5% larger than that of the Non-
Hertz theory algorithm, which means that the actual resistance of
overturning coefficient had been overestimated by the simplified algo-
rithm. Therefore, the critical overturning moment obtained by the Non-
Hertz calculation theory is more conducive to grasp the actual resistance
of the overturning ability of the rotating system and is conducive to the
safety of rotating monitoring of swing bridge.

6. Conclusions

In this study, the spherical joint instability issue during the con-
struction of the swing bridge is addressed. A new formula is proposed
based on the Non-Hertz theory to calculate the contact stress of the
spherical joint. The comparative analysis shows its superiority
compared to the currently applied simplified algorithm and finite
element method. Based on the accurate prediction of contact stress, a
new formula to describe the resistance of the overturning moment is
proposed. The results show that the resistance of the overturning
moment based on the new formula is reliable in predicting the critical
overturning moment, which guarantees the safety of the rotating pro-
cess. The following conclusions can be obtained from the acquired re-
sults and supplementary case study:

When the spherical joint of the rotating bridge is in a static state, the
stress calculation of the spherical joint based on the newly proposed
method is closer to the actual situation than the simplified algorithm,
and the deviation is reduced by 20%. Moreover, the contact stress of
Non-Hertz contact theory is generally lower than the results calcu-
lated by simplified algorithm against other engineering cases (see
case study in Supplementary materials). The new calculation method
reflects the stress distribution of the spherical joint more precisely.
The new critical resistance of overturning moment calculation for-
mula yields smaller values than that of the simplified algorithm, and
the calculating accuracy of critical overturning moment formula is
improved, which decreases the resistance of overturning moment by
40.5%. Moreover, the new overturning moment calculation is lower
than the that of the simplified algorithm at 37.70% (see case study in
Supplementary materials). The new formula to calculate the critical
resistance of the overturning moment is more applicable to the actual
rotating process.

Based on the new resistance of the overturning moment algorithm,
the resistance of the overturning coefficient can estimate the over-
turning resistance of the rotating process accurately up to 40.5%,
which guarantees the safety of bridge construction.
